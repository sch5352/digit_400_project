13th Amendment,https://www.conservapedia.com/13th_Amendment,"Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which formally abolished slavery in the United States, passed the Senate on April 8, 1864, and the House on January 31, 1865. On February 1, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln approved the Joint Resolution of Congress submitting the proposed amendment to the state legislatures. The necessary number of states ratified it by December 6, 1865.

AMENDMENT XIII

Section 1.  Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.


Section 2.  Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.
Background
In 1863 President Lincoln had issued the Emancipation Proclamation declaring “all persons held as slaves within any State, or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free.” Nonetheless, the Emancipation Proclamation did not end slavery in the nation. Lincoln recognized that the Emancipation Proclamation would have to be followed by a constitutional amendment in order to guarantee the abolishment of slavery. 
The 13th amendment was passed at the end of the American Civil War before the Southern states had been restored to the Union and should have easily passed the Congress. Although the Senate passed it in April 1864, the House did not. At that point, Lincoln took an active role to ensure passage through congress. He insisted that passage of the 13th amendment be added to the Republican Party platform for the upcoming Presidential elections. His efforts met with success when the House passed the bill in January 1865 with a vote of 119–56. 
With the adoption of the 13th amendment, the United States found a final constitutional solution to the issue of slavery. The 13th amendment, along with the 14th and 15th, is one of the trio of Civil War amendments that greatly expanded the civil rights of Americans.

Ratification
The Thirteenth Amendment was officially ratified on December 6, 1865, 309 days after Congress had proposed it [1].  Many Southern states ratified it only because Congress had made ratification an official condition of their readmission to the Union after the Civil War.
New Jersey, Delaware and Kentucky ratified this amendment after initially rejecting it.  Kentucky did not ratify this amendment until 1976, in a symbolic gesture.

Effects
The only immediate effect was to abolish slavery in the few states where it had not already been abolished.  It has subsequently been raised several times in the Supreme Court:

 In the Selective Draft Law cases, and again in Arver v. United States, the defendants unsuccessfully argued that the Thirteenth Amendment prohibited military conscription.
 In Butler v. Perry, Butler unsuccessfully argued that the Thirteenth Amendment prohibited the government from forcing him to maintain public roads.
 In Bailey v. Alabama, the Supreme Court ruled that the Thirteenth Amendment prohibited laws that indirectly, through presumptions of evidence, compel labor.
 In United States v. Kozminski, the Supreme Court prohibited psychological coercion to compel labor.

Increased file vulnerability: A single lost of corrupted bit can result in the entire file being destroyed
Increased drive vulnerability: If an entire drive is compressed (an option which Windows makes easy in its modern versions) then this problem can be magnified—a lost bit or two can cause the entire contents of the drive to be destroyed.
Additionally, compressing files (or file systems) requires more work from the computer's processor, so this tends to decrease the operating speed on the computer while it is accessing such files.

''The Two Babylons'',https://www.conservapedia.com/%27%27The_Two_Babylons%27%27,"The Two Babylons, subtitled The Papal Worship Proved to Be the Worship of Nimrod and His Wife, is a famous treatise written by a Scottish Presbyterian minister, the Reverend Alexander Hislop, first printed in 1853 as a pamphlet and greatly expanded in 1858. The Two Babylons was first published as a book in 1916. The full title is The Two Babylons or The Papal Worship Proved to be the Worship of Nimrod and His Wife. 
The author claims that the Catholic Church, with its Popes and Sacraments was founded by the Roman Emperor Constantine in A.D. 325 as a blend of paganism and Christianity. He says the cross is a Pagan symbol, that it ""was the unequivocal symbol of Bacchus"", and ""This Pagan symbol seems first to have crept into the Christian Church in Egypt, and generally into Africa.""[1] The book became widely circulated as being a reliable refutation of the Catholic religion. Hislop presented Catholicism as the Whore of Babylon, and this argument has been taken up by mostly conservative Evangelical Protestants such as the Reformed Churches, Baptists, the Church of Christ, Herbert W. Armstrong and his Worldwide Church of God, and the King James Only movement. In the 20th century it has been promoted mainly by Christian Fundamentalists, and has been a standard source for children's and adult Sunday School education, and its arguments have been widely promulgated in publications, religious dictionaries and encyclopedias, and comic books, and most recently on a multitude of popular internet sites. It has influenced countless multitudes of Christians and non-Christians, and has been a source (but not the only source) of polemical invective against Catholics, particularly against those involved in government and politics. For more than a century (1853-1955) it was among the top best-sellers in England and America, and is still being published.
A sharp critique of common Roman Catholic practices and traditions, the book looks at the historical elements having similar appearance to those elements involved in various rites and positions held by the Church.  The result claims to be a revealing of how non-scriptural practices were fused with the teachings of Christ.  The work is complete with over 61 wood illustrations and liberal use of scholarly works dating from 1506 AD to 1858 including Milner's Church History (1712), Pontificale Romanum (1543, 1572), Justinus Martyr (1777), and Missale Romanum (1506, 1677).
The topics include:

Objects of Worship
Trinity in Unity
The Mother and Child
The Mother of the Child
Festivals
Christmas
Easter
The Nativity of St. John
The Feast of the Assumption
Doctrine and Discipline
Baptismal Regeneration

In the United States it was published by the Loizeaux Brothers, Inc., a non-profit organization in 1949 and 1959.  It was published again in 2007 by Standard Publications, Incorporated (ISBN 9781604244861).
The work has been completely discredited by painstaking professional historical research, and thoroughly rebutted and refuted by strongly evangelical former supporters who did follow-up research of their own.
Historians who have carefully researched the historical claims made in this book, and the source materials that author Hislop relied on, have determined that he is unreliable as an historian. Almost all of his ""facts"" are shown to be false, and his reasoning from superficial similarities of appearances and ritual actions is demonstrated to be completely unsound and without merit as ""proofs"" of pagan origins. This has demolished his credibility. 16th–19th century anthropologists who were contemporaries of the authors of his source materials have also shown that even among historians in the 16th–19th centuries most of his sources had no reliable historical credibility as researchers.
Impartial and objective evaluations by non-Catholic reviewers of this book have also determined that it is simply a calumny against the Catholic religion. This has refuted his Christian integrity as a writer. This does not prove that Alexander Hislop was a liar, but only that his book is full of falsehoods. There is a difference. He may indeed have been sincere in his belief. His methology was entirely wrong. His conclusions are errors.
Individual Christians who have enthusiastically read The Two Babylons, and have dismissed all criticism against it as negative propaganda, and have made the effort to diligently research its claims in order to defend it, have been profoundly disappointed in the book and its author, whom they assumed was telling the truth. Many of them have been astonished that a book so fully discredited should still be sold in Christian bookstores and recommended by online internet Christian sites. It is still being promoted as factual truth.

1800s,https://www.conservapedia.com/1800s,"The 19th century was the time period between 1801 and 1900. It was a busy time, because lots of things were going on at once. For example, there was the War of 1812, the Civil War, the American Indian Genocide, the Mexican War, and the Spanish-American War, all in the 19th century. The 19th century was also the time of cowboys and Indians in the West, and the Industrial Revolution in the East. Also, the United States was rapidly expanding during this time. The majority of states entered the Union during this time period.
In the arts, the 19th century saw the rise of Romanticism.
Britain was one of the most powerful nations during the 19th century, controlling Canada, parts of Africa, India, Hong Kong, and Australia.
Other major powers included France, which controlled most of North Africa and part of Canada and Asia; Belgium, whose territories included much of Central Africa, Asia, South America, and New Zealand; Holland, who dominated the spice and tea trades from the Azores and the Solomon Islands, and the Ottoman Empire, which covered a land mass equivalent to 20 times the size of Wales but was past its zenith and was backwards in comparison to the industrialized nations of Europe.

132nd Ariete Armoured Division,https://www.conservapedia.com/132nd_Ariete_Armoured_Division,"The Ariete Armoured Division was formed on 1 February 1939, in Milan from the core of the 2nd Armoured Brigade. The divisions initially comprised the 8th Bersaglieri Regiment, the 32nd Tank Regiment (equipped with L3 light tanks and a few M11/39 medium tanks), the 132nd Artillery Regiment, and additional divisional support units.
At the start of the Second World War the division was located in Verona and acted as a reserve unit during the French Campaign.
Later that year, some battalions from the 32nd Tank Regiment (the I and II battalions M11/39 Medium tanks and the III and V battalions M13/40 Medium tanks) were shipped to Libya to become part of the Special Armoured Brigade belonging to Marshal Rodlfol Graziani's 10th Army. During some fierce and protraced fighting from December 1940 to February 1941, the British Western Desert Force overran the 10th Army, occupying the whole of Cyrenaica and threatening the Italian hold on their Northern African possessions.
On 24 January 1941, the remainder of the Ariete landed in Tripoli and, on 31 March, saw its first action during General Erwin Rommel's first desert offensive, playing a decisive part in the Battle of El Mechili. From February 1941 to November 1942, the Ariete Division took part in the North Africa campaign attached to the Italian 20th Motorised Corps. It was reinforced in 1941 by the 132nd Tank Regiment, which later completely replaced the 32nd, disbanded in mid-1942. 
The 132nd Tank Regiment's battalions (initially the VII, VIII and IX, the former two later replaced by the X and XIII) came equipped with M13/40 or M14/41 medium tanks, and, starting in early 1942, with Semovente 75/18 battalions from the 132nd Artillery Regiment.
The division maintained its excellent combat record in Libya and Egypt, overrunning several Allied units during Operation Crusader. It took part in Rommel's second desert offensive and took part in the battles around El Alamein. During the Second Battle of El Alamein, the Arietelost approximately 120 of its tanks in the attempt to counter the British offensive and cover the withdrawal of the Germans. Its gallantry gained the respect and praise of both the British Commonwealth forces and the Afrika Korps.
On 4 November 1942, at about 15:30, the last few surviving tanks, surrounded by an overwhelmingly superior force, broadcast their last message, ""Enemy tanks broke through South of Ariete Division. Ariete thus surrounded, located 5kms northwest of Bir-el-Abd. Ariete tanks keep on fighting!""
They were destroyed to the last tank. On 21 November 1942, the Division was disbanded, but its name was kept by a task force assembling its remnants (along with the survivors from the Trieste Infantry Division and Littorio Armoured Division) into a fighting unit.
Ariete Tactical Group kept fighting throughout the long retreat and subsequent battles in Tunisia, and was later forced to surrender along with the whole Axis Army in North Africa.

2004 Madrid Bombings,https://www.conservapedia.com/2004_Madrid_Bombings,"The 2004 Madrid train bombings (also known as 11/3 after the pattern of 9/11, but in European style) was a collection of coordinated terrorist bombings against the commuter train system of Madrid, Spain  which killed 191 people and wounded 1,460 on the morning of March 11, 2004.  The Islamic group al Qaeda was responsible.[1]

The Attacks

The attacks consisted of a series of ten explosions that occurred at the peak of the Madrid rush hour aboard four commuter trains. Thirteen improvised explosive devices were reported to have been used, all but three of which detonated.
The attacks were the deadliest assault by a terrorist organization against civilians in Europe since the Lockerbie bombing in 1988 and the worst terrorist assault in modern Spanish history. The number of victims in this attack far surpassed Spain's previous worst bombing incident in Barcelona in 1987, which killed 21, carried out by the Basque armed terrorist group Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (""Basque Fatherland and Liberty"").  Official statements issued shortly after the Madrid attacks identified ETA as the prime suspect, but the group, which usually claims responsibility for its actions, denied any wrongdoing.[2]
The explosions occurred during the morning rush hour, targeting a busy commuter rail line that runs just south of downtown Madrid. Four bombs (planted at the front, middle, and rear of a single train) exploded at 7:39 at Atocha station, and three bombs planted on a single train went off simultaneously just outside of Téllez street, near Atocha station. Two more bombs on one train detonated at 7:41 at El Pozo del Tío Raimundo station. One further bomb exploded on a train at Santa Eugenia station at 7:42. Most of the casualties occurred at Atocha/Téllez (89 confirmed dead) and El Pozo (70) with another 17 at Santa Eugenia.
Eventually, 191 people were confirmed dead (177 at the scene, 13 while under medical care), and 1,460 were wounded. Initial reports of 202 deaths were later revised down due to the misidentification of body parts.[3]
Initially it was feared that families of illegal immigrants would be afraid to contact the authorities for fear of being deported for immigration violations, but Spanish Prime Minister José María Aznar announced an immigration amnesty for victims of the attack.
The explosion at Téllez street appears to have been timed to coincide with the explosion at Atocha. However, the train carrying the bombs was held up by a red signal and so exploded just outside of the station.
Two unexploded bombs were found at the centre and rear of the train. The nine bombs aboard the Atocha and Téllez trains were, according to experts, designed to bring down the roof of the entire station at Atocha.
Security forces carried out a controlled explosion of a suspicious package found near the Atocha station and subsequently deactivated the two undetonated devices on the Téllez train. A third unexploded device was later brought from the station at El Pozo to a police station in Vallecas, and became a central piece of evidence for the investigation. It appears that at least the El Pozo bomb failed to detonate because a cell-phone alarm used to trigger the bomb was set 12 hours late.
All of the devices are thought to have been hidden inside backpacks. Despite Spanish Government's claims that the explosive used was titadine, a type of compressed dynamite used by ETA in recent years, forensic analysis of one of the remaining unexploded devices found at El Pozo revealed the explosive used there to be Goma-2, manufactured in Spain and not used by ETA since the 1980s. The police investigated reports of three people in ski masks getting on and off the trains several times at Alcalá de Henares between 7:00 and 7:10. A van was found parked outside the station at Alcalá de Henares containing detonators, audio tapes with Qur'anic verses, and cell phones.[4][5]

Responsibility
Although ETA has a history of mounting bomb attacks in Madrid, planting delayed-action bombs to kill rescue workers and using booby traps (such as explosives in wallets), as well as also having attempted to attack trains, the March 11 attacks were on a scale far exceeding anything previously attempted by a European terrorist organisation. Observers have also noted that ETA customarily issues warnings before its mass bombings and that there was no warning for this attack. Europol director Jürgen Storbeck has commented that the bombings ""don't correspond to the modus operandi which ETA has adopted up to now"". These observations led to early suspicion of Islamic terrorists, who prefer larger body counts. 
The attacks came exactly 30 months, or exactly 911 days, after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City. This followed the noted pattern of Islamofacist terrorist groups choosing to strike on days of significance to them.  It is also worth noting the similarities between the Madrid attack and the September 11 attacks: both were highly calculated, using public transportation to inflict civilian casualties and mass devastation in a spectacular fashion.
Osama bin Laden issued a public threat in October 2003 to carry out suicide bombings against any countries joining the US-led invasion of Iraq: ""We reserve the right to retaliate at the appropriate time and place against all countries involved, especially Britain, Spain, Australia, Poland, Japan and Italy."" At the time, Spain had some 1,300 soldiers stationed on Iraqi soil. In addition, bin Laden had spoken earlier of wishing to return the southern Spanish region of Andalucia to Muslim control, reversing the Reconquista of 1492.[6]
Information made public on March 12 by the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI) revealed that intelligence agencies had known for two months that a terrorist attack was being planned against a country entering into an election period. However, they mistakenly believed that country to be Iraq. The supporting documents, written in Arabic, belonged to a senior al-Qaeda leader, Yusuf al-Airi, and had been obtained by the FFI over the Internet, after his death in May [2003].
According to the FFI Muslim fundamentalism expert Thomas Hegghammer, the documents described in detail the tactics and strategies that were to be employed. The tactic was to break the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq by performing successive strikes on the co-operating member states, starting with the one which would most easily lose its resolve to keep its troops stationed in Iraq, and then following on with the rest. The Iraq war was very unpopular in Spain (around 90% refused to participate in this conflict), and so this would make a likely first target.

History
Following the Civil War, Congress submitted to the states three amendments as part of its Reconstruction program to guarantee equal civil and legal rights to black citizens. The major provision of the 14th amendment was to grant citizenship to “All persons born or naturalized in the United States,” thereby granting citizenship to former slaves. Another equally important provision was the statement that “nor shall any state deprive any person of live, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” The right to due process of law and equal protection of the law now applied to both the Federal and state governments. On June 16, 1866, the House Joint Resolution proposing the 14th amendment to the Constitution was submitted to the states. On July 28, 1868, the 14th amendment was declared, in a certificate of the Secretary of State, ratified by the necessary 28 of the 37 States, and became part of the supreme law of the land. 
Congressman John A. Bingham of Ohio, the primary author of the first section of the 14th amendment, intended that the amendment also nationalize the Federal Bill of Rights by making it binding upon the states. Senator Jacob Howard of Michigan, introducing the amendment, specifically stated that the privileges and immunities clause would extend to the states “the personal rights guaranteed and secured by the first eight amendments.” He was, however, alone in this assertion. Most senators argued that the privileges and immunities clause did not bind the states to the Federal Bill of Rights.
Not only did the 14th amendment fail to extend the Bill of Rights to the states; it also failed to protect the rights of black citizens (at least until Brown v. Board of Education). One legacy of Reconstruction was the determined struggle of black and white citizens to make the promise of the 14th amendment a reality. Citizens petitioned and initiated court cases, Congress enacted legislation, and the executive branch attempted to enforce measures that would guard all citizens’ rights. While these citizens did not succeed in empowering the 14th amendment during the Reconstruction, they effectively articulated arguments and offered dissenting opinions that would be the basis for change in the 20th century.

14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution
AMENDMENT XIV

Section 1.
All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

Section 2.
Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice-President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.

Section 3.
No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.

Section 4.
The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void.

Section 5.
The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.

19th century,https://www.conservapedia.com/19th_century,"The 19th century was the time period between 1801 and 1900. It was a busy time, because lots of things were going on at once. For example, there was the War of 1812, the Civil War, the American Indian Genocide, the Mexican War, and the Spanish-American War, all in the 19th century. The 19th century was also the time of cowboys and Indians in the West, and the Industrial Revolution in the East. Also, the United States was rapidly expanding during this time. The majority of states entered the Union during this time period.
In the arts, the 19th century saw the rise of Romanticism.
Britain was one of the most powerful nations during the 19th century, controlling Canada, parts of Africa, India, Hong Kong, and Australia.
Other major powers included France, which controlled most of North Africa and part of Canada and Asia; Belgium, whose territories included much of Central Africa, Asia, South America, and New Zealand; Holland, who dominated the spice and tea trades from the Azores and the Solomon Islands, and the Ottoman Empire, which covered a land mass equivalent to 20 times the size of Wales but was past its zenith and was backwards in comparison to the industrialized nations of Europe.

104th United States Congress,https://www.conservapedia.com/104th_United_States_Congress,"The 104th United States Congress was the sessions of Congress that occurred from January 3, 1995 to January 3, 1997. Due to the Contract with America and dissatisfaction with Democratic policies, the elections of 1994 finally saw an increase in the Republican majority of Congress. House speaker Newt Gingrich declared Congress ""under new management"" during this Congress. This Congress was able to pass much excellent conservative pro-American legislation despite liberal and impeached president Bill Clinton being in office. Coincidentally, the ushering in of a Republican dominated Congress exactly coincided with the success of the US economy, a strong economy that lasted until the Democrats surprisingly won power back in 2006. Not surprisingly, the economy then dropped sharply, as did Congressional opinion polls.
The 104th Congress was the most productive in nearly 50 years.  President Bill Clinton, fearing defeat in 1996, signed many good bills into law.  The accomplishments of the 104th Congress included:

DOMA
Welfare reform
Prisoner litigation reform
the Solomon Amendment

1st Minnesota,https://www.conservapedia.com/1st_Minnesota,"The First Regiment of Minnesota Volunteer Infantry was a volunteer infantry unit of the Civil War, serving with the Union Army.  The First Minnesota was one of the first regiments formed when President Lincoln called for 75,000 troops on April, 1861.  They are noted in history for their bravery and sacrifice in many battles, especially at the Battle of Gettysburg.

Gettysburg
 1st MN Casualties of Gettysburg
On 2 July 1863, the second day of the battle, the Confederates were about to break through the Union lines.  General Winfield S. Hancock ordered the First Minnesota to fill the gap in the lines, putting them up against a much larger force.  The charge was made to buy time for reinforcements.  Even though they were alone and outnumbered, they managed to hold off the Confederates.  Of the 262 soldiers who charged, 215 were killed.  This is the largest percentage of loss for a regiment ever recorded in American history.[1]  General Hancock later stated:""I had no alternative but to order the regiment in. We had no force on hand to meet the sudden emergency. Troops had been ordered up and were coming on the run, but I saw that in some way five minutes must be gained or we were lost. It was fortunate that I found there so grand a body of men as the First Minnesota. I knew they must lose heavily and it caused me pain to give the order for them to advance, but I would have done it (even) if I had known every man would be killed. It was a sacrifice that must be made. The superb gallantry of those men saved our line from being broken. No soldiers on any field, in this or any other country, ever displayed grander heroism"".[2]

1984 Presidential Election,https://www.conservapedia.com/1984_Presidential_Election," ""I want you to know also I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience."" - President Reagan President Ronald Reagan was still popular and approved of by the time came for him to be reelected.  While Reagan easily won the Republican nomination with hardly any dissent, Democrats searched hard to find a candidate they thought could win. They eventually chose former Vice President Walter Mondale as their candidate. Mondale surprised America by choosing Representative Geraldine Ferraro as his running-mate, the first female Vice Presidential candidate in history and a political unknown. Despite his popularity, Reagan campaigned hard for reelection; however he seemed to look rather exhausted in the first of the Presidential Debates which was on the economy, an area where his administration had been strong. He improved by the second debate which was on foreign policy—an area where he did not yet have the same strong accomplishments, but Reagan appeared fresh and experienced and bounced back.

Primaries and convention
In 1984 longtime party mechanic Walter Mondale entered the convention 40 delegates shy but secured the nomination with Superdelegates, a contingent of unelected party insiders he helped write into the rules two years earlier. Superdelegates include sitting and former elected officials who can bypass regular rules governing delegate selection to avoid a grassroots backlash and still enjoy a position of power, prestige, and privilege.[1]
Insurgent challenger Sen. Gary Hart won 26 states and 1164 delegates at the convention. Walter Mondale won 17 states and is said to have amassed about 1600 delegates. Jesse Jackson, the first African-American to win states in a major party primary, questioned the disparity between his vote total and delegate count, but even the New Left turned New Democrat, Gary Hart, echoed the DNC in poo-poo'ing Jackson's complaint.[2]
By convention time Hart was beating President Reagan by 10 points in national polls, but Mondale won nomination capturing virtually all the Superdelegates. But most scholars and historians agree Mondale lost the General Election right there and then in his Acceptance Speech by vowing to raise taxes on the American people. 
Even at this late date more than 30 years later it is hard to ascertain just exactly how many Superdelegate votes there were at this crooked convention. As of April 2016 Wikipedia's 1984 Democratic Primaries page still does not even mention the term ""Superdelegate"" anywhere.  Multiple original sources put the figure between 550 and 800; The Nation magazine says ""roughly 700"" [3] and Salon says 550.[4] Wikipedia is silent on the matter. Whatever the result, it is patently clear the Democratic establishment was not going to let anyone other than Walter Mondale win the nomination after Sen. Ted Kennedy  who helped write the rules for a two-way contest between himself and Mondale forfeited the race early in 1982.[5]
One state, Wisconsin is recorded as having voted twice according to the official surviving record in primaries and caucuses under the new rules Mondale's DNC machine engineered.[6] Wisconsin Democrats had won a ruling against the Democratic National Party in the state Supreme Court which the DNC appealed to in the U.S. Supreme Court. The Democratic Party of Wisconsin was forced to abandon 80 years of direct primary election of delegates and adopt a closed caucus method of delegate selection (see Winograd Commission). Voters were disenfranchised, and only allowed to express a non-binding ""presidential preference.”[7]
Under the rules then, Superdelegates were not supposed to ""commit"" to  a candidate until the convention. Hart says he and his wife personally spoke with all of them to ask for their support, but virtually all were committed to Mondale for 2 years already.[8]
President Reagan ran unopposed in the primaries and won re-nomination.

Campaign
 
By 1984 Ronald Reagan was popular among Republicans and ""Reagan Democrats."" Mondale made issue over the large federal deficit, however that was overshadowed with low oil prices, low inflation and high employment. Mondale made a bold choice in his campaign, when he announced in his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention that he would raise taxes, which would come back to backfire on him. Reagan's campaign was mostly optimistic and positive. He produced several ads entitled ""morning in America"", which included lush images of Americans buying houses, raising flags, washing cars, and going to work. His campaign also talked about the importance of military spending and the Soviet threat. The most famous example is in an advertisement with a bear representing the Soviet Union prowling around the woods. The narrator then asks, ""Isn’t it smart to be as strong as the bear—if there is a bear?"" 
The two candidates participated in two presidential debates and George H. W. Bush and Geraldine Ferraro in one Vice Presidential debate. At 72, Reagan was asked about his age during the second debate. He responded ""I want you to know also I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience"", which would become one of the most memorable moments of the campaign.
Reagan was able to win the election with a landslide popular and electoral majority over Mondale, who won only the District of Columbia (which has never been won by a Republican candidate) and his home state of Minnesota.[9]  The Mondale/Ferraro ticket lost Geraldine Ferraro's home district, which voted for Reagan. In many ways, the election and its result were a repeat of the 1972 election, where a sitting Republican president won in a landslide against an extreme liberal Democrat.
Even in Minnesota, Mondale won by a mere 3761 votes, meaning Reagan came within less than 3800 votes of winning in all fifty states. Reagan won a record 525 electoral votes total (of 538 possible), and received nearly 60 percent of the popular vote. Mondale's 13 electoral college votes marked the lowest total of any major Presidential candidate since Alf Landon's 1936 loss to Franklin Delano Roosevelt. With regards to the Electoral College, Mondale's defeat was also the worst for any Democratic Party candidate in history.

17th amendment,https://www.conservapedia.com/17th_amendment,"The Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which called for the direct election of Senators, states:



 “

 The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, elected by the people thereof, for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote. The electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures.
When vacancies happen in the representation of any State in the Senate, the executive authority of such State shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies: Provided, That the legislature of any State may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments until the people fill the vacancies by election as the legislature may direct.
This amendment shall not be so construed as to affect the election or term of any Senator chosen before it becomes valid as part of the Constitution.


 ”



The Seventeenth Amendment was ratified in 1913 during the progressive era of Woodrow Wilson. The Seventeenth Amendment replaces the process of elected state legislatures picking U.S. Senators–and the Senators adhering to the principles of those elected legislatures–with a process of electing Senators by a majority vote of the people within a state, a shift in policy from the Founding Fathers Constitutional Republic to a form of direct Democracy. Consequently, the Seventeenth Amendment reduces the influence of state legislatures over United States Senators.  Some people claim that this leaves Senators more subject to influnce from  special interest groups (Lobbyists, Unions and Corporations), because Senators must raise funds for their expensive re-election campaigns.  
There are two impacting differences in the election and legislative process with the addition of the Seventeenth Amendment: (1) the people of a state vote for a Senator rather than the elected state legislatures, and (2) upon confirmation of an elected Senator, they are no longer under the influence of the people who elected them, nor the state legislatures, but are controlled by special interest groups otherwise known as ""Mob Rule,"" or rule by the majority. The long-term impact of the Seventeenth Amendment modified America's Constitutional Republic by fundamentally transforming it into a more progressive form of democracy, sometimes referred to as a ""democratic Republic"" by Public Union teachers, and of which has essentially reduced the people's protections under Constitutional Law by giving more power to the voters.  
Before the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment, the Senate was comprised of senators selected by state legislatures rather than elected by the people, and they legislature refused for years to pass this amendment. With the help of Woodrow Wilson's methodical, effective but destructive use of propaganda, the states resorted to an alternative mechanism for amendment, bypassing Congress and passing resolutions that called for a constitutional convention. When nearly enough states (2/3rd of the United States) had passed resolutions for a constitutional convention, the Senate averted a constitutional convention by finally passing the Seventeenth Amendment and sending it to the states for ratification.
The amendment has been criticized by some for eroding the principle of Federalism that the Constitution was based on.  On the other hand, the proponents of the amendment claim that the prior system allowed for Senators to buy the votes of the legislators that elected them.

Background
The process of senators being selected by the state legislatures seemed to work well until the mid-1850s. At that time, growing hostilities in various states resulted in vacant Senate seats. In Indiana, for example, the conflict between Democrats in the southern half of the state and the emerging Republican Party in the northern half prevented the election of any candidate, thereby leaving the Senate seat vacant for two years. This marked the beginning of many contentious battles in state legislatures, as the struggle to elect senators reflected the increasing tensions over slavery and states' rights which led to the Civil War. After the Civil War, problems in senatorial elections by the state legislatures multiplied. In one case in the late 1860s, the election of Senator John Stockton of New Jersey was contested on the grounds that he had been elected by a plurality rather than a majority in the state legislature. Stockton based his defense on the observation that not all states elected their senators in the same way, and presented a report that illustrated the inconsistency in state elections of senators. In response, Congress passed a law in 1866 regulating how and when senators were elected in each state. First, a voice vote would be taken in each house. If there was no overwhelming choice, then a concurrent vote would be taken. This process revealed information about voting preferences to minority cliques within the legislatures, who then knew who they had to support or oppose. This was the first change in the process of senatorial elections created by the Founders. The law helped but did not entirely solve the problem, and deadlocks in some legislatures continued to cause long vacancies in some Senate seats. Intimidation and bribery marked some of the states' selection of senators. Nine bribery cases were brought before the Senate between 1866 and 1906. In addition, forty-five deadlocks occurred in twenty states between 1891 and 1905, resulting in numerous delays in seating senators. So the American people said that we need more democracy, and left-wing muckraking journalists gave out calls for supporting the 16th and 17th amendments as well as the Federal Reserve. [1]

Calls for Repeal
At least three U.S. Senators have called for the repeal of the 17th Amendment: Jeff Flake (R-AZ), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Senators Mike Lee (R-UT).  In addition, former Governors Rick Perry and Mike Huckabee have also called for its repeal.[2]

10th Mountain Division,https://www.conservapedia.com/10th_Mountain_Division,"The 10th Mountain Division is a light infantry division of the United States Army currently serving under the XVIII Airborne Corps. The unit's specialty involves fighting effectively in harsh conditions. Like the rest of the corps, it is designed for rapid deployment anywhere in the world. The division is currently based at Fort Drum, New York.

Overview
As a specially tailored infantry division, the 10th Mountain Division is rapidly deployable by strategic airlift to conduct a full spectrum of operations from humanitarian relief to combat. Over the last decade, the division has been involved in more deployments than any other division in the Army.
Rapid deployment is the foundation for a ready 10th Mountain Division. Ninety-six hours after notification, the division is expected to deploy by air, sea and land, worldwide. In order to ensure readiness for rapid deployment, the division designates subordinate units that will deploy first. At any given time, one of the division's two infantry brigades is designated as the First Infantry Brigade to Deploy (FIBTD), with one battalion task force within the brigade designated first to deploy. The deployment readiness of the brigade centers on the philosophy that it will deploy with the personnel and equipment on-hand at the time of notification. 
The 10th Mountain Division is designated a Force Package 3 unit and is considered a reinforcing combat unit or ""follow-on force"". The Army distributes its limited resources utilizing a ""tiered resource"" policy. Tiered resource means providing the highest level of warfighting resources to the ""first to fight, first to deploy, and first to be required"" units. Per war plans and current strategic lift schedules, the 10th Mountain Division can expect to remain a Force Package 3 unit with its authorized personnel strength between 90 and 95 percent. Units selected for peace operations normally are those not deemed immediately crucial in the event of a major theater war. As such, their resourcing generally is below that of the Army's ""first to deploy/fight"" units. 
The division commander's goal is to keep deployment tempo for units below 120 days per year. The FY98 projected deployment tempo for 1-32 and 1-87 Infantry Battalion's was 116 days. The projected deployment tempo for 2-22 Infantry is estimated at 158 days due to Alpha Company's deployment to Bosnia in support of Operation Joint Guard. Moral and discipline within the division are outstanding. The 10th Mountain Division was one of only a few divisions in the Army to reach its Department of the Army reenlistment objectives for FY97. 
In November 1939, the Soviet Union invaded Finland. Finnish soldiers on skis annihilated two tank divisions, humiliating the Russians. Charles Minot (Minnie) Dole, the president of the National Ski Patrol, saw this as a perfect example of why the U.S. Army needed mountain troops. Dole spent months lobbying the War Department to train troops in mountain and winter warfare. In September 1940, Dole was able to present his case to General George C. Marshall, the Army Chief of Staff, who caused the Army take action on Dole's proposals to create ski units.
On December 8, 1941, the Army activated its first mountain unit, the 87th Mountain Infantry Battalion (Later became an entire Regiment) at Fort Lewis, Washington. The unit was dubbed ""Minnie's Ski Troops"" in honor of Dole. The 87th trained on Mount Rainier's 14,408 foot peak. The National Ski Patrol took on the unique role of recruiting for the 87th Infantry Regiment and later the Division. After returning from the Kiska Campaign in the Aleutian Islands near Alaska the 87th formed the core of the new Division.

World War II
This unique organization came into being on July 13, 1943, at Camp Hale, Colorado as the 10th Light Division (Alpine). The combat power of the Division was contained in the 85th, 86th, and 87th Infantry Regiments. The Division's year training at the 9,200 foot high Camp Hale honed the skills of its soldiers to fight and survive under the most brutal mountain conditions. 
On June 22, 1944, the Division was shipped to Camp Swift, Texas to prepare for the Louisiana maneuvers of 1944, which were later canceled. A period of acclimation to a low altitude and hot climate was necessary to prepare for this training. 
On November 6, 1944, the 10th Division was redesignated the 10th Mountain Division. That same month the blue and white ""Mountain"" tab was authorized.
The division entered combat on January 28, 1945 in the North Apennine Mountains of Italy. The division faced German positions arrayed along the 5 mile long Monte Belvedere-Monte della Torraccia ridge. Other divisions had attempted to assault Mount Belvedere three times, even holding it temporarily, but none had succeeded. To get to Mount Belvedere the division first had to take a ridge line to the west known to the Americans as the Riva Ridge. The Germans on Riva Ridge protected the approaches to Mount Belvedere. The assault on Riva Ridge was the task of the 1st Battalion and F Company, 2d Battalion, 86th Mountain Infantry. After much scouting, it was decided the assault would be at night, a 1,500-vertical-assent. The Germans considered the ridge to be impossible to scale and manned it with only one battalion of mountain troops. The attack by the 86th on February 18, 1945, was a complete success and an unwelcome surprise to the Germans.
Mount Belvedere was assaulted next. Belvedere was heavily manned and protected with minefields. Shortly after the 86th assault on the Riva Ridge, the 85th and 87th Regiments made a bayonet attack without covering artillery fire on Belvedere beginning on February 19. Again the surprise of the assault was successful and after a hard fight, the peak was captured. Realizing the importance of the peak, the Germans made seven counterattacks over two days. After the first three days of intense combat, the division lost 850 casualties to include 195 dead. The 10th had captured over 1,000 prisoners. The 10th was now in a position to breach the German's Apennine Mountain line, take Highway 65 and open the way to the Po Valley.
On April 14, 1945, the final phase of the war in Italy began. With the 85th and 87th leading, the 10th Mountain Division attacked toward the Po Valley spearheading the Fifth Army drive. The fighting was fierce with the loss of 553 mountain infantryman killed, wounded, or missing in the first day.
On April 14, Private First Class John D. Magrath, from East Norwalk, Connecticut, assigned to Company G, 2d Battalion 85th Infantry, became the division's only Medal of Honor recipient. His company was pinned down by heavy artillery, mortar and small-arms fire near Castel d’ Aiano, Italy. Shortly after the company had crossed the line of departure, it came under intense enemy fire and the company commander, Captain Halvorson was killed. Volunteering to accompany the acting commander with a small reconnaissance party moving on Hill 909, radioman Magrath set out with the group. After going only a few yards, the party was pinned down. But instead of flopping to the ground as the others had done, Magrath, armed only with his M-1 Garand, charged ahead and disappeared around the corner of a house. Coming face to face with two Germans manning a machine gun, Magrath killed one and forced the other to surrender. Five more of the enemy emerged from their foxholes, firing at Magrath and retreating toward their own lines. Discarding his rifle in favor of the deadlier German MG-34 machine gun, Magrath mowed down the fleeing enemy, killing one and wounding three. He then saw another German position, moved forward, and exchanged fire until he had killed two and wounded three and captured their weapon. The rest of Company G followed his lead with amazed admiration. Later that day, Magrath volunteered to run through heavy shelling to gather a casualty report. As he was crossing an open field, two mortar rounds landed at his feet, killing him instantly. John Magrath, age nineteen, was awarded the Medal of Honor, posthumously. In June 1995, Fort Drum, New York renamed its Soldiers Sports Complex as the John D. Magrath Gymnasium. A plaque and portrait at Magrath Gym honor his memory.
Early on April 20, the seventh day of the attack, the first units of the 85th Infantry Regiment broke out into Po Valley. Five days of attack had cost 1,283 casualties. With the German's mountain line broken, the next objective was to cross the Po River.
On the morning of April 23, the 10th was the first division to reach the Po River. The first battalion of the 87th Mountain Infantry, the original mountain infantry unit, made the crossing under fire in 50 light canvas assault boats.
The final combat for the 10th Division took place in the vicinity of Lake Garda, a canyon lake at the foothills of the Alps. On April 27, 1945, the first troops reached the south end of the lake, cutting off the German Army's main escape route to the Brenner Pass. The drive was delayed by destroyed tunnels and road blocks. Using amphibious DUKWs, these obstacles were bypassed and the towns of Riva and Tarbole at the head of the lake were captured. Organized resistance in Italy ended on May 2, 1945.
The 10th completely destroyed five elite German divisions. In 114 days of combat, the 10th Division suffered casualties of 992 killed in action and 4,154 wounded. 
Since the 10th Mountain Division was one of the last to enter combat, it was to be used in the projected invasion of Japan. These plans ended with the surrender of Japan in August 1945. After a brief tour of duty in the Army of Occupation in Italy, the 10th was sent to Camp Carson, Colorado. There on 30 November 1945, the 10th Mountain Division was disbanded.

Postwar years
Veterans of the 10th Mountain Division were in a large part responsible for the development of skiing into a big name sport and popular vacation industry after World War II. Ex-soldiers from the 10th laid out ski hills, built ski lodges, designed ski lifts and improved ski equipment. They started ski magazines and opened ski schools. Vail, Aspen, Sugarbush, Crystal Mountain, and Whiteface Mountain are but a few of the ski resorts built by 10th Mountain veterans.
To meet the Army's requirements to train large numbers of replacements the 10th was reactivated as a training division on July 1, 1948, at Fort Riley, Kansas. It didn't retain its wartime designation as a Mountain Division and as result lost its ""Mountain"" tab. The Division had the mission of processing and training new soldiers for service with other Army units. The outbreak of the Korean Conflict in June 1950, enlarged this mission. A total of 123,000 men completed basic training with the 10th during the period 1948-1953.
In January 1954, the Department of Army announced that the 10th Division would become a combat infantry division, and be sent to Europe under a new rotation policy. The 10th Training Division was reduced to zero strength in May 1954. The personnel and equipment of the 37th Infantry Division were brought to Fort Riley, and on June 15, 1954, became the new 10th Infantry Division. In what became known as Operation Gyroscope, the 10th replaced the 1st Infantry Division in Germany. The headquarters of the 10th Division was located in Wurzburg, with all units stationed within a 75 miles radius. Stretched in an arc, from Frankfurt to Nurenburg, the 10th occupied a strategic center position in the NATO defense forces. With 9 Infantry Battalions, 4 Artillery Battalions, and one Tank Battalion, the 10th Infantry Division was a powerful military force. The 10th Division was in turn replaced in Germany by the 3rd Infantry Division in 1958. The 10th was then sent to Fort Benning, Georgia and inactivated on June 14, 1958.

Reactivation
The Division was officially reactivated on February 13, 1985, at Fort Drum, New York as the 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry). The division commander after reactivation was Brigadier General William S. Carpenter. The 10th was the first division of any kind formed by the Army since 1975 and the first based in the Northeast US since World War II. The 10th Mountain Division (LI) was designed to meet a wide range of worldwide infantry-intensive contingency missions. Equipment design was oriented toward reduced size and weight for reasons of both strategic and tactical mobility.

Desert Shield/Desert Storm
Although the 10th didn't deploy to Southwest Asia as a unit, about 1,200 10th Mountain Division soldiers did go. The largest unit to deploy was the 548th Supply and Services Battalion with almost 1,000 soldiers, which supported the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division in Iraq. Following a cease-fire in March, the first Division soldiers began redeploying to Fort Drum. The last soldiers were welcomed home in June 1991.

Hurricane Andrew relief
Hurricane Andrew struck South Florida on August 24, 1992, killing 13 people, rendering an estimated 250,000 people homeless and causing damages in excess of 20 billion dollars. On September 27, 1992, the 10th Mountain Division assumed responsibility for Hurricane Andrew disaster relief as Task Force Mountain. Division soldiers set up relief camps, distributed food, clothing, medical necessities and building supplies as well as helping to rebuild homes and clear debris. The last of the 6,000 Division soldiers to deployed to Florida returned home in October 1992.

Somalia
Operation Restore Hope - December 1992 to May 1993. On December 3, 1993, the Division headquarters was designated as the headquarters for all Army Forces (ARFOR) of the Unified Task Force (UNITAF) for Operation Restore Hope. Major General Steven L. Arnold, the Division Commander, was named Army Forces commander. The Division's mission was to secure major cities and roads to provide safe passage of relief supplies to the starving Somali population. Due to 10th Mountain Division efforts, humanitarian agencies declared an end to the food emergency and factional fighting decreased. A Company, 41st Engineer Battalion built a 160-foot Bailey bridge north of Kismayo. It was the largest Bailey bridge built outside the U.S. since the Vietnam War. Beginning in mid February 1993, the Division began the gradual reduction of forces in Somalia.

Operation Continue Hope
On 4 May, the UN assumed the task of securing the flow of relief supplies in Somalia. All remaining Division units in Somalia came under the control of a new headquarters, United Nations Operations in Somalia (UNOSOM II).
On 3 October, Special Operations Task Force Ranger (TFR) conducted a daylight raid on an enemy stronghold, deep in militia-held Mogadishu. The Rangers had successfully captured some of warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid's key aides but went to the aid of an aircraft shot down by enemy fire. They were quickly surrounded by Somali gunmen. The 2-14th Infantry Battalion quick reaction force (QRF) was dispatched to secure the ground evacuation route. As darkness fell, the 2-14th Infantry was reinforced with coalition armor and for three hours they fought a moving gun battle from the gates of the Port to the Olympic Hotel and the Ranger perimeter. The 2-14th was successful in linking up with the Rangers and began withdrawal under fire along a route secured by Pakistani forces. As dawn broke over the city the exhausted soldiers marched, rode, and stumbled into the protective Pakistani enclave at city stadium. For 2-14th soldiers, the ordeal had lasted over twelve hours. The 2-14th had a total of twenty-nine soldiers wounded and one killed. Task Force Ranger suffered nineteen killed, fifty-seven wounded, and one missing (captured, later returned alive). Estimates of Somali militia losses were three hundred killed and over seven hundred wounded. With six and a half hours of continuous fighting, this was the longest sustained firefight by regular US forces since the Vietnam War.
The last divisional combat unit stationed in Somalia, 2d Battalion, 22d Infantry returned home March 12, 1994. In all, some 7,300 soldiers from the 10th served in Somalia.

Haiti
The Division formed the nucleus of the Multinational Force Haiti (MNF Haiti) and Joint Task Force 190 (JTF 190) in Haiti during Operation Uphold Democracy. The MNF-Haiti was the US led coalition force in Haiti which included soldiers from 20 nations. More than 8,600 of the almost 21,000 troops in Haiti wore the 10th Mountain Division patch.
At 0930 hours, on 19 September 1994, the Division's 1st Brigade conducted the Army's first air assault from an aircraft carrier. This force consisted of 54 helicopters and almost 2,000 soldiers. They occupied the Port-au-Prince International Airport. This was the largest Army air operation conducted from a carrier since the Doolittle Raid in World War II, where Army Air Force bombers were launched off of a carrier to attack Tokyo. 
The Division's mission was to create a secure and stable environment under which the legitimate government of Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide could be reestablished and democratic elections held. The final step in preparing for Aristide's return from exile occurred early on October 13, when General Cedras, his family and members his de facto government left the country for Panama. When President Aristide returned to the Port-au-Prince International Airport on October 15, 1994, his security was provide courtesy of the 10th Mountain Division.
The 10th Mountain Division handed over control of the MNF-Haiti to the 25th Infantry Division on January 15, 1995. The Division redeployed the last of more than 8,600 Division soldiers who served in Haiti by January 31, 1995. 

Bosnia
The 642d Engineer Company deployed for Bosnia on March 18, 1997 for a 6-month tour constructing and maintaining roads and base camps. Two companies of the 2d Battalion, 14th Infantry deployed for Bosnia a day later. B Company's mission is to defend a critical bridge site, C Company's mission is to act as the theater reserve.
In the fall of 1998, the division received notice that it would be serving as senior headquarters of Task Force Eagle, providing a peacekeeping force to support the ongoing operation within the Multi-National Division-North area of responsibility in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
Preparations began immediately for Stabilization Force 6. While division staff began planning, soldiers began training. The division split into two operations: Task Force Drum-for those remaining in the North Country-and Task Force Eagle, set to deploy to Bosnia. Warfighting skills remained the focus of the division's training. 
In preparation for the Bosnia assignment, four major events were staged in 1999, including an SFOR6 conference in Tuzla, Bosnia; a deployment exercise at Fort Drum as a rehearsal; a conference at Fort Drum and Fort Hood, and an inter-theater rehearsal by some staff members, with other units in Bosnia. 
Selected division units began deploying in late summer, to link up with their commander, Maj. Gen. James L. Campbell, who had preceded his soldiers to Bosnia. Approximately 3,000 division soldiers deployed. Meanwhile, at Fort Drum, every effort was made to ensure the safety and care of soldiers and families remaining at home. 
After successfully performing their mission in Bosnia, the division units conducted a Transfer of Authority, relinquishing their assignments to soldiers of the 49th Armored Division, Texas National Guard. By early summer 2000, all 10th Mountain Division soldiers had returned safely to Fort Drum. 
After adding humanitarian, training and operational deployments together, the 10th Mountain Division had earned the distinction of being the most deployed Army division during the 1990s, a period which had seen the greatest number of missions for United States military forces-reserve and active-since the end of World War II. 

Operation Enduring Freedom
Soldiers from the division secured key forward operating bases in both nations, screened over 3,500 detainees at Sherberghan Prison in Northern Afghanistan, and engaged in combat during operations Anaconda and Mountain Lion. During Operation Anaconda, Coalition Joint Task Force Mountain, commanded by Maj. Gen. F. L. Hagenbeck, killed several hundred Al-Qaeda terrorists and destroyed an important enemy base of operations in the Shah-I-Khat Valley 100 miles southeast of Kabul. Subsequent operations destroyed 4.5 million pounds of ammunition and killed or captured several hundred more terrorists. 
Elements from across the 10th Mountain Division were scheduled to return duties to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in May 2003. The rotation of soldiers has began in June and was to continue throughout the summer months. 
Elements of division headquarters replaced selected staff members and assume command-and-control duties with coalition forces of Coalition Joint Task Force 180. 
The 1st Brigade Combat Team joined other coalition forces conducting combat operations to eliminate remaining terrorists elements in the region. The soldiers also provided security and assist with humanitarian relief effort to the people of Afghanistan. The 2nd BCT provided forces to train the Afghan National Army. Other units from the division provided administrative and logistical support to deployed forces. 

Operation Iraqi Freedom
During 2003, 10th Mountain Division Soldiers continued to add to the division's history by selflessly going where the nation called on them to serve. As the year closed, more than 6,000 division Soldiers had deployed around the world to fight the war on terrorism. 
Members of 2nd Battalion, 14th Infantry Regiment had several combat engagements in Northern Iraq during formal combat operations while providing convoy security operations. Soldiers of 2nd Battalion, 15th Field Artillery Regiment, members of the 20th Air Support Operations Squadron and the 10th Target Acquisition Detachment also served in Iraq during formal combat operations. 
In March 2003, the 642nd Engineer Company and 725th Ordnance Company deployed to the U.S. Central Command region. Elements of 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment, 2-15th FAR, 548th Corps Support Battalion and 110th Military Intelligence Battalion, as well as 57th Transportation Company, 514th Maintenance Company and 725th Explosive Ordnance Company also received orders to deploy to the CENTCOM region. 
Already deployed were elements of 2-14 Infantry, 511th Military Police Company, 59th Chemical Company, Long Range Surveillance Detachment, 95th Firefighting Detachment and 520th Engineer Detachment. Soldiers of 4-31 Infantry also began deploying elements to Djibouti in April to continue fighting the global war on terrorism. 

Modular division
The 10th Mountain Division officially transformed into the modular format the Army is evolving into during a ceremony at Sexton Field on 13 September 2004. As part of the ceremony, seven units were inactivated and 13 units were activated. 
The seven units inactivated were as follows: Division Support Command; 3rd Battalion, 62nd Air Defense Artillery Regiment; 110th Military Intelligence Battalion; 10th Signal Battalion; 41st Engineer Battalion; 10th Forward Support Battalion and 710th Main Support Battalion. 
The 13 units activated are as follows: 3rd Brigade Combat Team (Unit of Action); 10th Mountain Division Support Brigade; Unit of Employment, Special Troops Battalion; 1st Squadron, 71st Cavalry Regiment; 10th Brigade Support Battalion; 1st Brigade Special Troops Battalion; 2nd Squadron, 71st Cavalry Regiment; 2nd Brigade Special Troops Battalion; 3rd Squadron, 71st Cavalry Regiment; 4th Battalion, 25th Field Artillery; 710th Brigade Support Battalion; 3rd Brigade Special Troops Battalion and the Support Brigade Special Troops Battalion. 
As the division transformed at Sexton Field, Soldiers of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team (Unit of Action) and 3rd Squadron, 17th Calvary Regiment were involved in combat operations in Iraq.

Differences between 2008 and other elections
In 2008, CNN-YouTube held the first debate in which the questions asked of the nominees in each party came primarily from YouTube viewer submitted videos. The debates received high ratings, however, CNN was criticized for not picking questions that were 'tough' or pertinent enough. One such example was during the Democratic Debate, when CNN chose to ask a question from a snow man, talking about global warming. During the Republican debate, some claimed that many of the questions were from Democratic supporters just meant to embarrass the Republican candidates. For example, a question over whether or not homosexuals should serve in the U.S. military was asked by retired general and gay activist Keith Kerr, an adviser to Hillary Clinton's campaign. 
The internet has also played a major role in the election, with then-Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul and Democratic candidate Barack Obama being very active on the internet.

Young voters
In 2004, 64% of voters aged 18–29 were registered to vote.  This year 75% of voters in that age group are registered.  This demographic usually favors Democrats.

Fewer Uncommitted
Fewer people were undecided this election than in most previous elections.  As of the beginning of October, 2008 approximately 6-8% of poll respondents were undecided, an amount that continued to decline as the election drew closer.

Election Day
The turnout was about normal, except for higher than usual rates among blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and voters under 30—all Obama groups.  The turnout of evangelicals and whites was similar to 2004. There have been allegations of Democrats driving voters around to different voting stations, and as these are Obama groups, this would strengthen the voter turnout of this demographic.

McCain vs. Obama
McCain had the early edge, wrapping up the Republican nomination before Obama was known to be the choice of the Democrats, but this was one of the few advantages he has had.  Both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama raised far more money than McCain, and the Democratic primary saw a surge of new voters coming out leading to a large increase in the rolls of Democrats.  From the historical position of a generally equal number of Republicans and Democrats, the numbers have now tilted 41% Democrat to only 32% Republican.  From the time that Obama was declared the nominee, opinion polling showed him with a modest advantage over McCain in terms of who the voters would choose to be their next President.
Obama's strategy was to tie McCain to George Bush, a very unpopular President, even though McCain was not a part of the Bush administration and often clashed with Bush during his time as senator.  McCain, for his part, had to walk a fine line with accepting praise from the President to woo conservatives, while at the same time keeping enough distance so as to not alienate moderates.  When possible, McCain went after Obama's lack of foreign policy experience.
The trends heavily favored the Democrats, especially after their major gains in 2006.  Overall, Democrat candidates have a +10% advantage over Republicans in a 'generic' election - the current unpopular President is a Republican, and the economy is treading water.  Also, based on statistical percentages of articles on each candidate, Obama was being focused on by the press far more than McCain.  When McCain chastised Obama for his lack of foreign policy experience and that he hadn't been to Iraq or Afghanistan in years, Obama's campaign set up for him to take a trip to both countries.  While this is expected in politics, the decision of every major network to send a team of reporters to follow him was unprecedented.  Obama spoke to 200,000 people in Berlin in a highly covered speech.  McCain spoke to 50,000 in Buffalo shortly thereafter and barely got a whisper.  Obama's numbers started to rise, but a good deal of the populace was noticing the disparity as 48% of those polled felt the press was trying to help Obama win.
Obama seemed pleased to coast on his advantages, but McCain realized he needed to shake things up.  He scored by pushing offshore drilling for oil during a time when oil prices were climbing almost daily.  Obama rejected the idea, but the poll numbers started to show a greater percentage of Americans warming to the concept[2] and McCain's numbers started to improve.  Obama announced he would accept some measure of offshore drilling, and McCain's momentum was halted and his gains retreated by a couple of points.  McCain started an ad campaign that acknowledged Obama's celebrity status, but asking what it meant.  A few days later at the start of August he called out Obama for 'playing the race card' when Obama made a reference to McCain and Bush trying to scare people because he (Obama) doesn't look like other Presidents on dollar bills.  The Democrats fired back, but quickly let the issue drop when poll numbers showed that most voters did consider Obama's statement to be racist.[3]  The bounce for Obama after the Berlin speech shrank back to pre-trip levels.  While Obama continued to enjoy a slight lead in the polls, McCain continued to keep the race close without either candidate breaking away. 
In mid-August, both candidates came together at the invitation of Pastor Rick Warren where each was asked a series of the same questions dealing both with political and personal views.  While not a debate, it was the first televised forum where both candidates had a chance to express themselves and their positions.  Obama hoped to appeal to Christian conservatives by expressing a religious side while McCain hoped to solidify the conservative base by sharing his own conservative and religious credentials.  The difference in style between the two was evident as Obama spent more time explaining and expounding on his positions while McCain was more straightforward and received more laughs with his candid speaking style.  The polling numbers continued as they had been.
There was a bounce at the start of the Democratic convention, but not what was expected as McCain suddenly drew even in the race.  The friction between Hillary Clinton and Obama as well as the perceived slight of Hillary when Biden was chosen as the Vice Presidential candidate hurt Obama at a time when his approval was expected to climb.  McCain then made a mistake by airing an ad of Hillary Clinton that 'supported' him.  Clinton was set to speak at the convention and it was no secret that there was bad blood between her and Obama and it was widely believed that her support for Obama would be lukewarm at best.  Instead, apparently galvanized by McCain's hubris before her speech, she came out strongly for Obama and rallied those who supported her.  Obama's pre-convention edge returned.  Obama followed it up with a very strong speech the next day in a huge stadium with fireworks and a Greek temple.  Dick Morris, a former Bill Clinton political strategist who gave advice to the Republicans in 2008, felt that Obama had done such a good job reaching out to the groups that he needed that he would pull ahead by double-digits.  In order to suppress the bounce from the convention, McCain announced his Vice Presidential candidate the next day, a woman, Alaskan governor Sarah Palin.  The bounce for Obama was muted at first, but increased in the following days to surpass pre-convention levels, especially as Sarah Palin came under heavy attack in the media.
The edge continued as the Republican convention began.  Losing a day to the hurricane, their shortened convention came out strong as well, emphasizing John McCain as a patriot and a maverick for change who is tested and will do what is right for the country regardless of political affiliation.  It was notable for the secondary role that the sitting President played, talking only briefly and barely being mentioned after that.  The convention tied McCain to Ronald Reagan, a popular Republican President who was able to gain the support of a good number of conservative Democrats, an ability that McCain would badly need to emulate.  While the convention had very high ratings starting with Palin's well received speech, it was unclear what the impact would be in the polls.  Indeed, Obama continued to lead directly afterward, but that soon changed with a turn of about 8 points and a slim lead for McCain.  The Republican convention had actually more than balanced out the powerful Democratic convention.
While Obama had stated that his campaign would avoid negative advertising, as it became clear that the bounce from the convention was continuing to last and he might lose the election, his campaign turned more forcefully to negative advertising.  In ads aired since the Republican convention through mid September, McCain's ads were about Obama 56% of the time, but Obama's ads were about his opponents 77% of the time.[4]  Obama also received a large boost from the press which vigorously attacked McCain, but even more so Palin.  Obama appeared on The O'Reilly Factor and was treated with civility and respect, even if not with agreement.  McCain and his wife appeared on The View and were treated to openly antagonistic attacks.  The constant negative barrage and reporting slowly moved the numbers back to even.
As the negative articles on Palin continued to intensify, some of which just quoted celebrities who had never met her calling her ""whacko"" or a ""hater of women"", her first major interview with Gibson was a turning point.  Gibson asked Palin about the Bush Doctrine, but wouldn't define it for her even as she asked questions for clarifications.  When she then answered with her understanding, Gibson rebuked her by implying that she misunderstood the doctrine.  In truth, since the term is only a press invention, it has taken on different meanings at different times and the definition that Palin gave matched one that Gibson himself had used years earlier.  Nevertheless, it was a moment and was jumped on by the press.  Those who saw the interview voted heavily that they were now less likely to vote for Palin.  The attack on her had muted her effectiveness, even if it was unjustified.
Stemming the tide of the McCain campaign's lead became a strong swing for Obama with a series of events that went to the Democratic nominee's favor.  The polls began to tack to Obama's favor with the collapse of Lehman Brothers and a subsequent 500-point drop in the Dow Jones Index.  Then, President Bush sounded a major alarm on the economy and proposed a huge 700 billion dollar rescue plan for the mortgage industry, which sent shock waves through the American populace and swept them with even more fear on the economic picture.  Bush called both Presidential nominees to meet with him and Congress.  It gave Obama a boost in legitimacy, his previous Achilles' heel.  While he had a weak record in accomplishments and showing leadership, the chance to be propelled to a position of prominence handed it to him on a silver platter.  Moreover, the plan was more problematic among Republicans than it was among Democrats, giving Obama another boost merely by supporting it while putting McCain on more shaky ground.  Both candidates supported it once again blurring McCain's advantage in experience if both men were seen as interchangeable in their reaction.
McCain chose to suspend his campaign until a deal on the rescue package was reached, a mistake.  The Democrats could add pork to the plan and make it even more unpalatable to the Republicans, and they did.  As the first debate loomed and no deal had been reached, McCain was in a quandary.  He chose to attend the debate under the view that the plan was well under way to being passed.  After the debate the plan was actually defeated and wouldn't be adopted, with more changes, until the following week.
McCain's debate with Obama went well and he was viewed as having done better than expected.  Unfortunately for him, Obama was also viewed as doing better than expected and was seen as looking Presidential, further cementing his standing and locking in a lead in the polls that had become rather substantial.  The Vice Presidential debate was the most watched in history and Palin was given high marks for her performance, but unfortunately for the Republican ticket, Biden was also on his game that night and also came across well.  There were no changes in the polling numbers and the number of undecided voters began to quickly dwindle.  The second and third debates caused little change as well.
With Obama spending 110 million dollars on TV advertising in October alone, including 30 minute specials on each of the major networks, McCain was hard pressed to make up the necessary ground to win the election after being outspent by 3 to 1 for TV adds over that time period.  He couldn't count on regular TV to help put in a good word for him either, as late night political jokes are running at a pace of 7 jokes against McCain/Palin for every 1 joke against Obama/Biden and a study of news stories on McCain and Obama since the end of the conventions found that 57% of news stories about McCain were negative while only 29% were for Obama.[5]  A later study by the independent Pew Research Center found that the discrepancy had grown even worse.  McCain had 57% of the articles about him negative while only 14% were positive, while Obama had more positive articles than negative.  The only network to achieve a balance, 40% negative for both, was Fox News.[6]

General Strategy
McCain's team emphasized to convince the electorate of the long-term leadership and experience that John McCain has shown in two decades of government service while emphasizing the relative untested nature of Barack Obama.
Obama's team stressed that Obama is the candidate of fresh ideas while downplaying his relative inexperience compared to the more seasoned McCain.  When possible, McCain is lumped together with George Bush, an unpopular President.

Republican Strategy
With more limited funding than his Democratic rival, McCain had favored open town hall meetings to attract the greatest number of people.  He is focusing his advertising on swing states.  He also asked for open debates with Obama of the Lincoln-Douglas variety where candidates can talk directly to each other, but this was not accepted by the Democratic camp which prefers the current structured format.
McCain will highlight his record of leadership, his service to his country and stress that as President he can be counted on to keep America safe from outside threats.  McCain's strongest supporters are the elderly - the group that most wants stability.
McCain's choice of Sarah Palin as his Vice Presidential nominee was a departure from what was expected and helped to show that he would go down paths that the Republican party had not done in the past.  McCain has touted Palin's record of standing up to the Alaska Republican party when she resigned from an Ethics Commission in protest over a lack of ethics of fellow commissioners, as well as when she ran against, and beat, then-incumbent Governor Frank Murkowski in the Republican primary in 2006.  McCain will continue to tout her as a ""maverick"" to complement his own maverick image that he is trying to emphasize. Last, by choosing a female running mate, McCain hoped to pick up the votes of female voters disaffected with the perceived slight of Hillary Clinton by Obama.  Prior to the start of the Democratic convention, 30% of Hillary's supporters had still not backed Obama and there was a good deal of bad blood between the two.
With the unfolding of the campaign season and watching the Democratic strategy and how it was playing out in the press and polls, the McCain campaign decided not to cede the moniker of change to Obama, but rather to take it upon themselves by emphasizing that McCain has a track record of change - while Obama does not.  The McCain campaign feels it needs to have the voters ask who can be trusted more to get the job done, and if that occurs, then they have the advantage.
With the selection of Palin, and the energy it has brought to the conservative base, McCain has taken to larger rallies, as opposed to town hall meetings and press conferences.  By mid-September, he had gone four weeks without a town hall, and three weeks without a press conference, instead sticking to larger engagements, appearing alongside his vice presidential nominee, with larger crowds than he had experienced earlier in his campaign.

Democratic Strategy
Democrats are confident that the low popularity of President Bush and particularly Operation Iraqi Freedom, which John McCain supports, puts them in a highly favorable position for 2008.  They have been cautious in the Iraq arena realizing that 'The Surge' worked and they were on the wrong end of that issue.  Focus is being put on a timeline for troops coming home, a position that most of the American population favors.
Democrats believe it is their race to lose, but also realize they had a good chance to win the last two Presidential elections and came up short each time.  General wisdom also states that a poor economy favors Obama, so they will emphasize the dire times in this area.  As in past elections, differences between those who have obtained a high income level and those who have not will be emphasized. In fact, the Democratic strategy in many ways mirrors that of their strategy in 1992 when the Democrat-controlled Congress deliberately caused economic disruption, knowing full well that the public would blame sitting president George H.W. Bush, and thereby allowing Bill Clinton to win that year's presidential race.
Favored by the young, Democrats will try hard to encourage and get out the young vote, a task that has proven more difficult than expected in the last two election cycles.  To their advantage, Obama made his vice presidential pick via text message to cell phone numbers registered on the site.  The announcement went to 3 million cell phones, a useful database for ""Get Out The Vote"" (GOTV) efforts, when voters may not be home or reachable on their landline.
As an extension of the DNC's strategy in the 2006 elections, led by Howard Dean, Barack Obama has been working towards a ""50-state strategy.""  The campaign is working to place campaign offices throughout the country with a focus on voter registration.  The increase in the rolls of Democratic voters from the primary battle between Hillary Clinton and Obama played out well for the Democrats and puts pressure on Senator McCain even in typically red states, and more specifically, ""Lean Republican"" states, to use the Cook Political Report's term.  In addition, with a fundraising advantage, Obama is airing ads in those tight states forcing McCain to make decisions about whether to use funds to match ads and campaign efforts in those states or rely on historical results that those states will support him and focus funds in traditional toss-up states instead.

Fundraising
Barack Obama had a significant edge over Hillary Clinton in the fundraising department during their contest for the Democratic nomination, but both actually set records for raising money and both raised far more money than John McCain.  McCain didn't have to spend as much since he locked up the Republican nomination much earlier than Obama locked up the Democratic.  Both Obama and McCain said they would accept government funds—which would also cap how much the candidates could raise on their own—but Obama, who could presumably raise more through his own sources, changed his mind and later declined.  Much of McCain's war chest will come from the Republican Party in general, which has more money to spend than their Democratic counterparts.  McCain's campaign raised $47 million in August, a very sizable figure for him so far and a personal record, but not as strong as Obama's best months. In the same time period, Obama set a record with $66 million. Obama, still having an edge in fundraising that has continued throughout his run for the Presidency, saw $10 million collected the day after Sarah Palin's strongly received convention speech, a new one day record.[7]  The Palin announcement has been good for John McCain's fundraising as well.
Obama set a new record of $150 million raised in September and over $600 million overall.[8]  Obama's camp does not release information on who contributes to the campaign.


Conventions
Democratic National Convention
For a more detailed treatment, see 2008 Democratic National Convention.
The 2008 Democratic National Convention was held in Denver, Colorado, from August 25 to August 27 at Pepsi Center. There, Senator Obama and his running mate were selected to be the party nominee's. Barack Obama will accepted the party's nomination in front of a crowd of more than 75,000 in a free, open event held at INVESCO Field at Mile High, in a platform resemblant to a Greek temple. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is the Permanent Chair of the Convention.
The convention had a rocky start as friction between supporters of Obama and the Clintons was not resolved.  Instead of Obama getting a bump in the polls, his support actually declined.  The Democrats also seemed to be at odds on finding a unifying strategy for how hard to attack John McCain and how to present it.  As Democratic pundit James Carville said in an interview on CNN, ""If this party has a message, it's done a <heck> of a job hiding it tonight, I promise you that.""[9]
A bleak convention was turned around by the Clintons. Infighting between Obama and Hillary continued through the day of her speech, but a comprise was reached, and, beyond expectations, she gave a rousing speech for Obama - possibly as an angry response to McCain's latest ad that showed her 'supporting' him. Bill Clinton the next night also praised Obama, something that he failed to effectively do in 2000 for Al Gore when he centered on his accomplishments and gave little more than lip service to Gore with statements amounting to 'and Al Gore was there too'. The convention, possibly remembering that, gave him the topic he was to speak on instead of choosing his own. Clinton was angered, but it worked. He came through. By the time Obama spoke on the last night, the theme that was missing at first was clear, and Obama mixed a message of attacking McCain with the need for change and even outlining some expensive programs that would appeal to the target populace who has been lukewarm to him. From a political point of view, the convention did what it was supposed to.


Republican National Convention
For a more detailed treatment, see 2008 Republican National Convention.
The 2008 Republican National Convention was held in Saint Paul, Minnesota from September 1 (Labor Day) until September 4. The presumptive nominee was Senator McCain. The location has political significance in that Minnesota will likely be a close state during the general election, as will its neighboring states Wisconsin and Iowa.
The convention schedule had to be altered due to the upcoming landfall of Hurricane Gustav. The first day almost entirely focused on raising money for Hurricane relief.  This led to a shortened three day convention instead of four and there was some shuffling of who was speaking on which day to accommodate the suddenly shortened time span.  In a surprise, George W. Bush was only delivered an eight-minute speech by satellite.  In another surprise Sarah Palin's speech was watched by as many people as saw Obama give his acceptance speech on the closing night of the Democratic convention, as over 40 million people tuned in.[10]  She was considered the highlight of the convention, even surpassing John McCain's speech the next day, and was noted for doing an exceptional job.  Recognizing the strong asset that they have in her, the Republicans made reference to her many times on the last day of the convention.  McCain, not known for being comfortable reading prepared speeches in a convention hall, delivered a solid speech.  While Obama continued to enjoy a lead in the polls, it changed quickly thereafter to a slight McCain-Palin edge.  The Republican convention more than canceled out a very powerful Democratic convention.

Leftist violence
 Poster circulated by community organizers. Other posters depicted rock throwers with the caption, ""Shut Down the RNC!,"" dead elephants, and derogatory and demeaning comments about gay Republicans. [2]
Progressives for Obama shares a huge membership overlap with the Movement for a Democratic Society (MDS), a group of former Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) members and sympathisers. MDS re-founded SDS in 2006 for a new generation of college students and functions as a support group for SDS's 130 college chapters. Independent researcher Trevor Louden refers to MDS as ""the brains behind the SDS brawn.""  The reconstituted SDS was very prominent in the violence at the Republican National Convention at St Paul.[11] The founder of ACORN, Wade Rathke, denouncd[12] an FBI informer who foiled a terrorist plot to kill delegates at the Republican Convention.[13]

Vice Presidential Candidates
Democratic Vice-Presidential Candidate
On August 23, Senator Barack Obama announced, via text message to 3 million cell phone numbers of his supporters, his nomination of Joseph Biden to Vice President.  Biden's selection was considered to be a prudent move by Obama, filling a hole in his own foreign policy experience that McCain could exploit.  With the implosion of John Edwards, Biden was widely expected to be the choice.  In order to help build up suspense, Biden said he was not chosen when he spoke to the press the day before, only to be shown as the Vice Presidential candidate the next day.  A long-term senator and Washington insider with over two decades of service in the Senate, his earlier 1988 plagiarism scandal and frequent gaffes (including one in which he insulted Obama in a racist manner during the 2008 election) were deemed to be less negative than the positive that his strong experience credentials could bring to the race.  

 Joseph Biden




Republican Vice-Presidential Candidate
 thumb
Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska was announced as John McCain's choice early on Friday, August 29, the day after the Democratic convention ended.  A surprise choice not even considered by the press to be on McCain's short list, her selection caught the political world off guard.  It had been expected that Mitt Romney would earn the honor, but McCain had other ideas.  At first denigrated by the people in the Obama campaign, Obama's own statement was one of cautious neutrality to feel out what impact her selection would have on the race.


In an interesting twist, the selection of the Vice Presidential candidates changed the dynamics of the race.  By Obama picking Biden, he helped to fill the hole that McCain had been attacking dealing with a lack of foreign policy experience.  McCain's strongest point, experience, would lose some of its luster.  But the selection of Biden, and the passing over of Hillary Clinton, left another opening.  By aligning himself with someone who has been a Democratic stalwart, Obama's claim to change became less pronounced.  McCain seized upon that to select a Vice President that no one expected, and a woman, and steal some of the Democratic thunder.  Her lack of foreign policy experience would cut into the experience angle that had been in play earlier, but her own maverick streak in becoming governor by ousting another Republican, combined with John McCain's maverick choice in selecting her led to a new emphasis on McCain's own maverick past. Palin arguably had more ""executive"" / managerial experience than either McCain, Biden or, notably, Obama.  Suddenly he saw an opportunity to steal the moniker of change that Obama had been wearing, and he went for it.  Such a change in position occurring from the Vice Presidential selection is rare in Presidential politics.

Debates
Presidential Debates
For a more detailed treatment, see 2008 Presidential Debates.
There have been three presidential debates for the 2008 election season.  The first debate on September 26 discussed ""Foreign Policy & National Security"" and also dealt at length with the economic crisis. The result was a statistical draw where both candidates did better than expected in the eyes of the public.  The longer term impact worked out well for Obama who already had a lead going in, and benefited from solidifying that position.
The second debate on October 7, followed a town hall-style.  The questions came from audience members and the Internet, as chosen by the moderator.  Again the result was a statistical draw as far as who was considered to be the winner.  But with time running out for McCain, he needed something to make the people move his way, and that required a clear breakthrough that never happened
The final debate was held on October 15 concerned ""Domestic and Economic Policy."" Both candidates were again viewed as having done well, which was a tactical defeat for McCain as the poll numbers showed only small changes.

Vice Presidential Debate
There was one vice presidential debate held on October 2.  Palin did much better than expected, but Biden was also in top form.  No clear winner emerged and the poll numbers remained largely unchanged, a strategic win for the Democratic ticket that only had to maintain their lead to win the election.  The number of people who watched the debate was an alltime record for a Vice Presidential debate, and was viewed by more people than any of the three Presidential debates.

Third parties and Independents
As usual there were a number of third party candidates, but none made much of an impact.  Briefly the Libertarian Bob Barr had enough strength to become a spoiler for McCain.  He faded quickly. See United States Presidential Election, 2008 -- Third Party Candidates.

Primaries
For expanded primary information, see United States Presidential Election, 2008 - Primaries
The primary season for both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party officially began on January 3, 2008 with the Iowa Caucuses and ended on June 3, 2008.[14]  The 2008 election cycle saw a major shift in the primary election calendar, frontloading many primaries into early February.[15]
John McCain had to get his footing at first, but was pretty much assured the Republican nomination after Super Tuesday.  Barack Obama had a much tougher road, but rode out a string of victories in February to eventually outlast Clinton and take the nomination.  During that time he had raised more money than any other candidate in history giving him a huge boost, a trend that would continue into the general election.

Casualties







From 1978-2000, parts of southern Lebanon were continuously occupied by Israel or its allied militia, the principally Maronite Christian South Lebanese Army. the occupation, given the codenam Operation Litani, began on March 14, 1978, and ended when Prime Minister Ehud Barak, himself a veteran of 1973 fighting in Lebanon, finally ordered an Israeli withdrawal on May 24, 2000. The United Nations did not rule the Israelis to be in compliance with Security Council Resolution 425, which called for the total withdrawal of Israeli forces from the area, until June 16, 2000.
Some analyses date the beginning of the occupation four years later, with the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon.

Operation Litani
The 1975 outbreak of the Lebanese civil war put a damper on Palestine Liberation Organization raids into Israel from southern Lebanon, but in 1978 the PLO reorganized and infiltrated eleven terrorists into Israel on March 11. The terrorists, led by an 18-year-old woman, managed to kill one American as he sunbathed on a beach, followed by thirty-seven Israelis in the hijacking of two buses, an event which became known as the Coastal Road Massacre.  Three days later, Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin ordered 25,000 soldiers of the Israeli Defense Forces to expel all PLO elements from Lebanon south of the Litani River, hence the name of the operation.  The IDF, which at that point had never lost a war, was able to accomplish this mission with the loss of only 20 men, with the kill ratio estimated at anywhere from 50-100 to 1.  While 285,000 civilians fled north of the river, it remains unclear what portions were Lebanese and Palestinian since Lebanon had become a popular destination for Palestinian refugees following the defeat of their attempt to overthrow the government of Jordan in 1970; 300,000 Palestinians were estimated to live there already in 1975.
Following their passage of Security Council Resolution 425, the United Nations deployed an interim force comprised largely of Irish troops to keep the peace as the Israelis withdrew.  The SLA, as a Lebanese force, had nowhere to withdraw to; accordingly, a three-way low-intensity war began between it, the PLO, and the UN troops.

Operation Peace of the Galilee
In the summer of 1981, Israel became alarmed that the PLO appeared to be gaining an advantage over the SLA when the former organization crossed the Litani River in brigade strength and established themselves in the villages of Qana, Dir Amas, and Juya.  Accordingly, Israel launched air raids against these and other Palestinian targets in Lebanon.  The Palestinians were now close enough to fire long-range artillery including rockets into northern Israel, which they did in response to these strikes.  Two weeks later American envoy Philip Habib negotiated a cease-fire, but the Israelis began joint patrols with the SLA, resulting over the next eleven months in the deaths of 27 Israel soldiers.  Israel retaliated for only one of these deaths, an officer killed by a land mine on April 21, 1982, with an air raid on the coastal Lebanese town of Damour, which killed 23 people.
On June 3, 1982, Shlomo Argov, Israeli ambassador to the United Kingdom, was shot and permanently paralyzed by terrorists from the Abu Nidal organization.  Since Abu Nidal was at that time part of Fatah, the leading faction within the PLO, the Israeli cabinet decided to mount a full invasion and clean out all centers of Palestinian resistance within 25 miles of the Lebanese-Israeli border.  The IDF began softening up the Palestinians the next day with air raids as far north as the capital, Beirut (halfway up the Lebanese coast).  Refugee camps were treated as military targets because it was common knowledge that gunmen were always present there.  Syria, which at that time occupied most of Lebanon not held by the PLO, SLA, or Maronite Phalangists, contested the air campaign and came under attack in turn, with the loss of all but 10 of the aircraft which engaged Israel's air force, and some dozens of armored personnel carriers and tanks.  The PLO retaliated by renewing its attack with artillery and mortars upon northern Israel; this time, two civilians were killed and six wounded.



"
1958 Midterm Elections,https://www.conservapedia.com/1958_Midterm_Elections,"In the midterm election of 1958, the Democratic Party gained 49 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and 16 seats in the U.S. Senate from the Republican Party, cementing their majorities. Democrats also picked up six governorships and 686 state legislative seats.
Democrats had a narrow majority in both Houses of Congress, while there was a Conservative Coalition between Republicans and southern Democrats. Following his landslide reelection in 1956, the aging President Eisenhower's popularity began to wane. The deep 1957-1958 recession and anger among organized labor because of right-to-work laws led to strong Democratic gains that arguably paved the way for the Great Society. Democrats also attacked Republicans for desegregating public schools. Eisenhower's credibility was further weakened by the Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik, and Republicans found themselves on defence.
Republicans never came close to regaining control of the House until 1994 and the Senate until 1980. 
Despite Democrat John F. Kennedy's presidential victory over Richard M. Nixon, Democrats still lost 20 House seats in 1960.

Where are they?
Executable programs come in many different forms.  A program installer is itself an executable file, which loads the desired executable along with other resources into the operating system.  Executable files are also required to open non-executable files.  Documents, for example, are opened by a word processor, such as Open Office's Writer, or Microsoft Word.  There are also heavily integrated into the system.  If one wishes to use the Windows system's calculator, they must run the calc.exe (probabably using the shortcut in the Start menu).  If one wishes to view or open files on their desktop, they unwittingly use the executable program explorer.exe (which starts when the system initializes) to find their file before they use another program to open it.

Misuse of the Term
Although there are many executable files, there are also non-executable files which invoke (call) executable ones.  For example, Java script files (file extensions .jre, .jar, .js, and .jse) are sometimes referred to as programs, but they are simply instructions for an executable already installed on the system.  Even some program installers are this way.  Microsoft Windows systems will sometimes have programs installed on them using Microsoft Installer files (.msi file extension).  These files act like executable files, but actually contain nothing more that instructions and data for the install program included with the system to use.

Executable File Extensions
 .exe (Windows)
 .run (Apple)[1]
 .app (Apple)[2]

1988 Presidential Election,https://www.conservapedia.com/1988_Presidential_Election,"   As President Ronald Reagan's second term in office was coming to end, his Vice-President, George H. W. Bush, decided to run for the Presidency.  He was criticized more than his predecessor, but he was still very popular among Republicans.  He managed to win the Republican nomination for President in a difficult primary battle with Senator Bob Dole. To run against Bush the Democrats nominated Massachusetts Governor, Michael Dukakis, who won in a less heated campaign. Both of the candidates ran hard and sincere campaignes. During them Bush won great support with several promises which involved no new taxes.[1] Ultimately, his hard work in Government, his promises as a candidate, and family-values standards won Bush the Presidency. 
Although Vice President Bush campaigned under the shadow of the popular President Reagan, who left office during a time of national optimism, he trailed in the polls throughout the summer because of issues such as the large federal deficit, the Iran-Contra affair and an October 1987 stock market collapse. However, he managed to close the gap by fall of the campaign. With the Cold War at its height, Bush focused on his foreign policy experience as a member of the U.S. military, ambassador to the United Nations and eight years as Vice President. In response Democrats criticized Bush's selection of Dan Quayle for Vice President as being too inexperienced. Michael Dukakis offered a traditionally unabashed liberal vision of increased government on health care, education, and housing as the press swooned over his 'Massachusetts Miracle' which George Bush and the Republican Party referred to as the 'Massachusetts Mirage'. Dukakis' position on crime and capital punishment became a major issue. As governor Dukakis allowed weekend prison passes to criminals with the Massachusetts furlough program, one of whom was Willie Horton—a large, African American convicted murderer who raped a white woman and tortured her fiancé, while he was on a weekend pass. The Bush campaign hit heavily on his furlough program in campaign advertising right before the election.  Also, during the second Presidential debate Dukakis was asked: 
""If Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?""
To which Dukakis responded: ""No, I don't, Bernard. And I think you know that I've opposed the death penalty during all of my life. I don't see any evidence that it's a deterrent, and I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime."" [2]
He also hurt his campaign when he was seen riding in a tank—grinning and looking diminutive in an oversized helmet, resulting in ridicule by the public of having the idea of him as commander in chief.
Dukakis chose U.S. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas as his vice presidential running mate, and Bush chose U.S. Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana.
The electorate was generally uninspired with the candidate selection as the total number of people who went to the polls was less than in the 1984 election.  The press tried to dog Bush with a ""wimp"" moniker during the campaign and then later complained when he used negative advertising.  Nevertheless, it removed the wimp idea from the minds of the voters and many of his negative points stuck.  An effort by the press to say that he was 'wrapping himself in the American flag' also came up short. 
Interestingly, multiple slogans from the Bush campaign became relatively well known in culture.  The first was his reference to ""a thousand points of light"" and the second that tied to the first that he saw a ""kinder, gentler nation"".  Finely, the ominous ""read my lips -- no new taxes"" that achieved fame later during his Presidency.

1988 Democratic Primaries
David Duke announced his presidential campaign to win the Democratic nomination for the 1988 presidential election. Duke, a white supremacist hated the black civil rights activist Jesse Jackson and his ""Rainbow Coalition"" and he claimed to command his ""Sunshine Coalition"" in opposition.[3] Duke lost in his home state of Louisiana to Jesse Jackson.[4] Duke won the 1988 New Hampshire Democratic Vice-Presidential primary in a landslide with 10,531 votes for 99.69% of the vote.[5]

2008 Republican Primary,https://www.conservapedia.com/2008_Republican_Primary,"The 2008 Republican primary schedule starts January 3, 2008.  Note that caucuses and conventions tend to favor party regulars and conservatives, while open primaries allow independent voters to choose more liberal candidates.  In parentheses are the primary system plus the delegate count, after adjustment for  penalties assessed by the RNC for moving their primaries too early.

Candidates and Delegates
Delegates needed to win the nomination: roughly 1200 out of about 2400 (after adjustment to the original total of 2488 for state penalties assessed shifting their primaries early).
Rudy Giuliani is expected to win New Jersey and New York on Super Tuesday, February 5, 2008, and those states award their delegates on a winner-take-all basis.[1]  That will give Giuliani 153 delegates towards the roughly 1000 needed to win the nomination.
John McCain will likely win Arizona, which is another winner-take-all state, giving him 53 delegates on Super Tuesday.
Mike Huckabee should win the winner-take-all state of Georgia, to earn him 72 points on Super Tuesday.
Mitt Romney is strong in the winner-take-all states of Massachusetts, Vermont and Utah, which yield a total of 96 delegates.
Ron Paul should do well in New Hampshire, with its independent streak and proportional assignment of delegates, and in his home state of Texas, which has a late primary (March 4) but 140 delegates.
Fred Thompson can be expected to win the winner-take-all state of Tennessee, assuming he wins a majority of the votes, for a total of 55 delegates.
Duncan Hunter should do well in California, which has 173 delegates on a district-based winner-take-all system.
Tom Tancredo should do well in Colorado, which has 46 delegates in a proportional system.
Rough total of delegates already locked up by the analysis above: nearly 600.  That means for a candidate to win a majority he must win about 100 he won above, plus a tremendous 1100 out of the 1800 remaining delegates, which is over 60% of Republican votes cast.  Is this even plausible?

2010 midterm elections,https://www.conservapedia.com/2010_midterm_elections," In the 2010 Midterm Elections, the Republican Party gained 63 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and six seats in the U.S. Senate from the Democratic Party. Republicans also gained six governorships, including Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan.  Republicans gained 680 seats in state legislatures, the most in the modern era.[1]
Republicans gained the most House seats since the 1938 Midterm Elections, giving Republicans their biggest House majority, and Democrats their smallest minority, since 1946.  When blue dog Democrats are added to the Republicans on certain issues like gun control or marriage, the Republican majority is even greater than in 1946.
Democratic loses could be attributed to public rejection of the socialistic policies of the Obama administration. The public disapproved of President Obama's economic policies. In the days leading up to the election, a majority of voters supported repealing/replacing The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, sixty-five percent of voters said that the economic stimulus package either hurt the economy or did no good,[2] and fifty-four percent of those voting said they were dissatisfied with the performance of Barack Obama. Given the high level of Democratic success in the 2006 and 2008 elections, they were also put in the position of having to defend a large number of seats.
John Boehner (R-Ohio), become Speaker of the House in the 112th Congress, exchanging places with Nancy Pelosi (D-California). By tradition Pelosi would be expected to resign her leadership position after such a stunning repudiation by the electorate, but as a self-centered liberal she insisted on becoming the next Minority Leader.

2009 elections
In the Nov. 3, 2009, off-year elections, defeat was the fate of Democrats in New York City, New Jersey and Virginia. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent, spent his way to a third term in New York City while Republican Bob McDonnell won in a landslide for governor of Virginia; in New Jersey Republican Christopher Christie ousted the incumbent Democrat Jon Corzine despite his millions and Obama's campaigning.
Conservatives scored a major internal party victory in Oct. 2009 by forcing the Republican candidate Dede Scozzafava out of a House race in New York's 23rd district, for being too liberal. The Conservative Party candidate was defeated by the Democrat, however, opening up recriminations between GOP officials and conservatives on why the district was lost for the first time since 1992. Conservative activists zeroed in on the 2010 race for Florida's open Senate seat, in which the Republican party Senate campaign committee endorsed moderate Gov. Charlie Crist but the more conservative Marco Rubio mounted a successful challenge. ""If I were Charlie Crist in Florida, what's happening in New York 23 would make me extremely nervous,"" GOP strategist Todd Harris said. ""A lot of the establishment Republicans underestimated the grass-roots anger across the country about spending and the expansion of the federal government. The anger is boiling over now, but a lot of the seeds of discontent were planted over the last five to six years.""[3]

Ad campaigns
 Cartoonist Michael Ramirez of Investor's Business Daily captures the tone of the 2010 Midterm elections.
In late 2009 national money was being poured into nine districts, where Democrats who voted for their party's health care reform may be in trouble. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, representing business, has spent at least $1.6 million in November.  Liberals shoot back against the Chamber and 60 Plus Association with ads targeting 12 Democrats and one Republican who supported health reform. Three liberal groups, Americans United for Change and the labor unions AFSCME and SEIU are teaming up for $1.75 million worth of counter-messaging on broadcast and cable TV in the districts of Reps. Berry, Cao, Connolly, Donnelly, Ellsworth, Hill, Hodes, Michaud, Murphy, Perriello, Pomeroy, Snyder and Titus.
In mid-October the Democratic National Committee, echoing charges debunked[4] by the New York Times, insinuated that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce was using ""foreign money"" to fund ads criticizing Democrats. The president said in a Maryland stump speech, ""we learned that one of the largest groups paying for these ads regularly takes in money from foreign corporations. So groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence American elections, and they won't tell you where the money for their ads comes from…. This is a threat to our democracy."" 
The president himself has received $543,219 from Swiss banking giant UBS AG,[5] a foreign banking corporation which was later fined a record $780 million for its part in helping the rich evade U.S. income taxes.[6] Columnist Ruben Navarrette warned the pitfalls of playing the ""foreign card"" is



 “

 both offensive and dangerous. It exploits people's fears of the unknown and appeals to the prejudice that many of us feel toward those who are different. It also fuels ugly nativist instincts that -- once unleashed -- can do real damage....Democrats know this better than anyone ... The birther movement, which suggests that Obama was actually born in Kenya and thus not eligible to serve as a president, is all about playing the foreign card...[7]

 ”


Commentator Charles Krauthammer called the unfounded attacks on the Chamber of Commerce a baseless McCarthyite smear,[8] while columinst Jacob Sullum wrote,



 “

 Obama's attempt to discredit his opponents by linking them to sinister outsiders reminds us that neither major party has a monopoly on xenophobia. To some extent, crying ""foreigner"" reflects the president's desperation in the face of the Democrats' looming midterm losses.[9]

 ”


Pre-election Forecasts
In recent years, as the chart shows, the incumbent party loses an average of 16 House seats.  The GOP needed 39 seats to win back the House.  
Democrats had to defend about 60 marginal House seats in 2010, as opposed to about 40 for Republicans. At high risk were 27 Democratic seats and just 13 Republican seats that may see a party switch.
Election forecasters in September 2009 were revising their predictions downward for the Democrats, as Obama's popularity continues to plunge. From April to August, Obama lost 10 points across the board—suffering losses in every group except blacks, who remain loyal to him.[10] The popularity of Congress remains low. Starting in January 2010 the number of Americans who identify themselves as Democrats was at a seven-year low.[11] The Republican party, however, suffers from a lack of leaders and its own poor reputation in voter esteem.
""No question, August proved cathartic for voters and chaotic for congressional Democrats. But way before the town hall meetings during recess, there were ample signs for Democrats to fear for their careers in 2010,"" concluded Cook Political Report House analyst David Wasserman, who predicts the Democrats will lose 20 seats in the House, but retain control.[12]  Wasserman concludes that a major shift has been underway among ""angry white seniors"" (over age 60), who strongly dislike the Obama health care proposals because they fear they will lose benefits they now have. 
Analyst Stuart Rothenberg reported that, ""Growing public concern about spending, taxes and the size of government has started to shift the national landscape away from the Democrats to a more neutral position, and quite possibly toward the GOP.""[13] Furthermore, an advantage for Republicans was that 48 House Democrats, 8 more than the size of their majority, come from districts that voted for both George W. Bush and John McCain.[14]
Columnist Rich Galen observed,



 “

 He railroaded his signature legislation - Obamacare - through the Congress costing his party 60+ seats in the 2010 mid-term election and guaranteeing GOP control of the House for the foreseeable future. Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi will go down in history as enablers of the sacrifice of Obama's Congressional allies on the alter of his enormous ego.[15]

Senate
Texas Senator John Cornyn, the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, quietly put Senate Republicans in a position to benefit as the national political environment went negative toward Democrats, and was successful in narrowing the Democratic majority. Without losing any of their seats, the Republican Party defeated two incumbents, Blanche Lincoln (D-Arkansas) and Russ Feingold (D-Wisconsin), and won four Democratic-held open seats: Illinois, Indiana, North Dakota, and Pennsylvania. Additionally, Republican Scott Brown was elected to replace the late Senator Ted Kennedy (D-Massachusetts) in a January special election.  

Republican Gains
Arkansas
Moderate Democrat Blanche Lincoln was defeated by 21 percentage points after Republicans made her one of their top targets in 2010. In the 2008 Presidential Election, Arkansas was one of the few states where John McCain exceeded George W. Bush’s margin, despite the national trend favoring Democrats. Generally, she voted the party line with President Obama, which angered her conservative constituents, but also voted against the Employee Free Choice Act (card check) and opposed to the public option in health care, which angered liberals. She began airing TV ads in March touting her independence from President Obama and national Democrats. Lincoln defeated Lieutenant Governor Bill Halter in a close runoff for the Democratic nomination.
Third district Congressman John Boozman easily won the Republican nomination, defeating State Senator Gilbert Baker and former State Senator Jim Holt. Boozman comfortably led thoughout the entire campaign.

Indiana
Two-term Democrat Evan Bayh dropped out of his reelection in February after polls showed he may be vulnerable after his vote for the economic stimulus package and government-run health care. Former Republican U.S. Senator Dan Coats, who predeced Bayh after retiring in 1998, announced his candidacy for his old Senate seat. Former six-term Congressman John Hostettler, State Senator Marlin Stutzman and businessman Don Bates Jr. were defeated for the Republican nomination. Conservative Congressman Mike Pence considered running, but instead chose to seek reelection in the House.
8th district Congressman Brad Ellsworth was the Democratic nominee. Dan Coats defeated Ellsworth by a 55%-40% margin. Ellsworth supported President Obama’s health care plan in a state where opposition to the legislation is higher than it was nationally.[16]

Illinois
Democratic Senator Roland Burris had been plagued by controversies. Burris was appointed to replace Barack Obama by Governor Rod Blagojevich, who had been arrested on a variety of federal corruption charges (including for trying to ""sell"" Obama's Senate seat). Burris was then accused of committing perjury after he admitted to not testifying truthfully at a committee investigating Governor Blagojevich. Burris announced he would not seek a full term in 2010.
Moderate-GOP Congressman Mark Kirk, representing a Democratic-leaning district that covers suburban Chicago, easily won the Republican nomination, while Illinois State Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias defeated Chicago Inspector General David Hoffman in a close primary. Both candidates faced negative media publicity, Giannoulias for the collapse of his family bank, and Kirk for exaggerating his military record. In the general election, Kirk defeated Giannoulias by a 48%-46% margin.

Massachusetts
Republican State Senator Scott Brown pulled a major upset when he defeated Attorney General Martha Coakley by a 52%-47% margin.
Liberal icon Ted Kennedy, the third longest-serving Senator in U.S. history, died in August 2009, marking the end of an era. During the 2004 Presidential Election the Democratic super-majority in the state legislator blocked the right of Republican Governor Mitt Romney to appoint an interim senator had John Kerry been elected President. After changing the law to allow Governor Deval Patrick, a Democrat, the right to appoint a temporary replacement for Kennedy, he choose former Democratic National Committee chairman Paul Kirk. He did not seek a full term of his own, and a special election was held on January 19, 2010. 
State Attorney General Martha Coakley won the Democratic primary, defeating businessman Alan Khazei, Representative Mike Capuano, and Boston Celtics co-owner Stephen Pagliuca. Charismatic State Senator Scott Brown was the Republican nominee.[17]

 a last minute appeal
It was a safe Democratic seat until January, when Democrats reeled in shock as Coakley lost her 30-point lead and trailed by 5-10 points in the closing hours. Coakley was an ineffective machine-style insider candidate who was unable to reach independents. Brown's main theme was that he would be the 41st senator and would block the Obama health care plan—which Massachusetts did not need, he explained, because it had its own plan in operation. Coakley responded by attacking bankers and bringing in big guns like Bill Clinton, John Kerry and Barack Obama. They appealed to regular Democrats and alienated the equally numerous independents, who preferred Brown by more than 2-1. 
The defeat for Coakley, coming on the heels of the Democrats' loss of Virginia and New Jersey in Nov. 2009, was a major blow to the liberal caused and reinvigorated the Republican party nationally.

North Dakota
Byron Dorgan, a three-term Democrat Senator from North Dakota, announced he would not seek reelection. Dorgan's announcement represented an opportunity for Republicans, after popular Governor John Hoeven announced his candidacy.[18] Hoeven defeated State Senator Tracy Potter by a 76%-22% margin, carrying every county.

Pennsylvania
After polls showed him losing the Republican primary by as much as 20 points, Arlen Specter simply changed party affiliation to Democrat. Despite full support by President Obama and virtually every elected Democrat in Pennsylvania as well as nearly every major newspaper, Specter went on to lose the Democratic nomination to 7th-district Congressman Joe Sestak in the primary, and faced former 15th district Congressman and Club for Growth President Pat Toomey, known for his economic conservatism. In the general election, Toomey defeated Sestak by a 51%-49% margin.

Wisconsin
Three-term incumbent Russ Feingold had positioned himself for a comfortable reelection after former governor and Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson announced he would not run. However, Tea Party activist and Oshkosh businessman Ron Johnson defeated Feingold by a 52%-47% margin.

Democratic Holds
California
Although California is a solidly Democratic state, conservatives originally saw outspoken liberal Senator Barbara Boxer as vulnerable. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was term-limited in 2010, announced he would not run. Former Hewlett-Packard Company President Carly Fiorina defeated former U.S. Rep. Tom Campbell and Assemblyman Chuck DeVore in the Republican primary. Boxer defeated Fiorina by ten percentage points.

Colorado
Appointed Democratic Senator Michael Bennet was narrowly reelected. Former Speaker of the Colorado House of Representatives Andrew Romanoff was defeated in his bid to challenge Bennet for the Democratic nomination, while Weld County District Attorney Ken Buck defeated former Lieutenant Governor Jane Norton in the Republican primary. 

Connecticut
30-year Senate veteran Chris Dodd announced he would not seek a sixth term. Dodd's approval ratings plummeted after his failed presidential campaign in 2008, his controversial mortgage deal from Countrywide, and revelations about the $165 million bonuses for AIG executives that he attached in an amendment to the economic stimulus package, despite receiving federal bailout money. Popular state Attorney General Richard Blumenthal won the Democratic nomination, increasing the Democrats' chances of holding the seat. However, his poll numbers dropped after a New York Times report revealed that he exaggerated his military record.
Republicans nominated World Wrestling Entertainment CEO Linda McMahon, defeating former Congressman Rob Simmons and libertarian-leaning economist Peter Schiff, a stock broker and adviser to Ron Paul’s 2008 presidential campaign. Blumenthal won the general election by a 55%-43% margin.

Delaware
Joe Biden was simultaneously elected to a seventh term in the Senate and Vice President at the same time. Democratic Governor Ruth Ann Minner appointed a ""caretaker"" Senator, Ted Kaufman. Michael Castle, a moderate Republican who also served as Governor and Lieutenant Governor, was heavily favored to win the Republican nomination. However, Tea Party backed insurgent Christine O’Donnell ousted Castle in the primary, improving New Castle County Executive Chris Coons chances in holding the seat for Democrats. The Republican Party had a mixed reaction to O’Donnell's victory. She had caused controversy regarding her views on creationism and Christian values. Coons defeated O’Donnell by a 57%-40% margin.

Hawaii
Democrat Daniel Inouye easily won reelection against Republican Representative Campbell Cavasso.

Maryland
Entrenched incumbent Barbara Mikulski easily won reelection, defeating physician and Queen Anne's County Commissioner Eric Wargotz.

Nevada
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid faced a competitive reelection in 2010. The ""Cook Political Report"" in September 2009 rateed the contest as ""Toss Up."" His status weakened in summer 2009, as discontent with President Obama and the Democrats' health plan mounted, and as the Recession of 2008 continues to batter Las Vegas and the entire Nevada economy, with no relief in sight from the stimulus bill Reid pushed through the Senate. Reid's inability to improve his standing in the polls, coupled with the deteriorating political environment for Democrats nationally, were clear indications that his political problems are deep and will be difficult (though not impossible) to fix, says Cook. 
After receiving the endorsement of the Tea Party Express and Club for Growth, former Assemblywoman Sharron Angle defeated former State Senator Sue Lowden and businessman Danny Tarkanian in the Republican primary. Reid defeated Angle by a 50%-45% margin.

New York
Senior Senator Charles Schumer was considered the safest incumbent of 2010 and won his reelection by a 66%-33% margin against Republican Jay Townsend.

New York-Special Election
Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand was appointed by Governor David Patterson to replace Hillary Clinton after much confusion on his part. Patterson mishandled the proposed appointment of Caroline Kennedy, gaining ridicule for both of them.  Gillibrand's moderate views alienated the left wing of the Democratic Party. Former Tennessee Congressman Harold Ford, Jr. has announced he will not seek a primary challenge to Gillibrand.
Nine-term Congressman Peter King has declined to run. Republicans are tried but failed to recruit former Governor George Pataki, who ran ahead in the polls with Gillibrand. Real estate billionaire Mort Zuckerman, despite having a record of supporting liberal causes, was mentioned as a possible Republican or Independent candidate to avoid a primary, however announced that he would not run. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani declined to seek the Senate seat.[19] Instead, Republicans nominated former Congressman Joseph DioGuardi, whom Gillibrand defeated by a 62%-36% margin.

Oregon
Democratic Senator Ron Wyden defeated his Republican challenger, Lewis & Clark College law professor Jim Huffman by a 57%-39% margin. 

Vermont
Patrick Leahy, the third most senior U.S. Senator, was reelected by a 64%-40% margin against Republican Len Britton.

Washington
Polls show that Senator Patty Murray, once considered well positioned for reelection, would face a competitive race against Washington's former state Senator, Dino Rossi. In November, Murray defeated Rossi by a 52%-48% margin.

West Virginia
Popular Democratic Governor Joe Manchin was elected to replace the late Exalted Cyclops Senator Robert Byrd. Businessman and 2006 nominee John Raese made the race surprisingly close by tying Manchin to the Obama administration.

Republican Holds
Alabama
Senior Senator Richard Shelby, who was originally elected as a conservative Democrat but changed party affiliation to Republican after the 1994 Republican Revolution, was handedly reelected, as he was in 1992, 1998, and 2004. 

Alaska 
Lisa Murkowski won a term for the U.S. Senate in her own right in 2004 by a close 48%-45% margin, however, in 2010 she lost the Primary Election against Joe Miller, a Conservative candidate and Tea Party favorite. Democrats nominated Sitka, Alaska Mayor Scott McAdams. Murkowski pursued her campaign as a write-in candidate, and was reelected with a 39% plurality, while Miller received 35% and McAdams 23%. She has the distinction of being the first person elected to the Senate via write-in since Strom Thurmond in 1954. 

Arizona
Senior Senator John McCain, the Republicans presidential nominee in 2008, caught a break when Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano was appointed Secretary of Homeland Security. However, former Congressman J. D. Hayworth challenged McCain in a primary, but was defeated by a 56%-32% margin. McCain went on to defeat Tucson City Councilor Rodney Glassman by a 59%-35% margin. 

Florida
Republican Governor Charlie Crist, who once enjoyed high approval ratings, appointed George LeMieux upon the resignation of Senator Mel Martinez. LeMieux held the seat temporarily for Governor Crist who decided to run for the Senate. He was the establishment pick for the Republican nomination, but was challenged by conservative Florida House Speaker and Tea Party backed candidate Marco Rubio, who led by 32 points according to Public Policy Polling.[20] Crist announced he would drop out of the Republican primary and run as an Independent. 
Crist alienated conservatives when he campaigned with President Obama in support for the $787 billion economic stimulus package, which was entirely opposed by the Florida Republican federal delegation. Democrats nominated 17th district Congressman Kendrick Meek, who defeated billionaire businessman Jeff Greene. Rubio was elected with a 49% plurality, defeating Crist who received 30% and Meek who received 20%. 

Georgia
First-term Senator Johnny Isakson's had solid standing for his reelection. His most formidable Democratic opponent, state Attorney General Thurbert Baker, instead sought a campaign for Governor. Isakson defeated Labor Commissioner Mike Thurmond by a 58%-39% margin.

Idaho
Mike Crapo's conservative voting record goes along with the Republican stronghold of Idaho. In 2004, he faced no Democratic challenger and won reelection with over 99% of the vote. Crapo's seat was one of the safest in the 2010 election cycle, and he won reelection by a 71%-25% margin.

Iowa
30-year incumbent Charles Grassley is one of the most distinguished and influential Republican Senators in Washington (he serves as ranking member of the Finance Committee). He was reelected by a 65%-33% margin against former U.S. Attorney Roxanne Conlin, carrying all but one county.

Kansas
Incumbent Republican Sam Brownback honored his campaign pledge to serve only two terms. 1st district Congressman Jerry Moran defeated 4th district Congressman Todd Tiahrt for the Republican nomination by a 50%-45% margin, while Democrats nominated Lisa Johnston, an administrator at Baker University.

Kentucky
Republicans had a victory when unpopular incumbent Senator Jim Bunning announced he would not seek a third term. Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson sought the Republican nomination, however was defeated by Tea Party activist Rand Paul, an eye surgeon who is the son of Texas Congressman Ron Paul. Paul received the endorsment of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin.[21] On the Democratic side, Lieutenant Governor Daniel Mongiardo (who lost to Bunning in 2004) was defeated by Attorney General Jack Conway. Paul campaigned on a reducation in taxion and spending, and won the support of conservatives and libertarians alike. Paul defeated Conway by a 56%-44% margin.

Louisiana
Louisiana, a conservative state, was not effected by the national trend for Democrats in 2006 and 2008. Republican Bobby Jindal was elected Governor by a landslide in 2007, in 2008 John McCain received a larger margin of victory in the state than George W. Bush in 2004, while the GOP gained two House seats from the Democrats. Yet first-term Republican David Vitter was considered to be vulnerable for his reelection after he confessed in 2007 to seeing an escort service, which has tainted his career. Third-district Congressman Charlie Melancon won the Democratic nomination. Vitter defeated Melancon by a 57%-38% margin.

Missouri
Incumbent Republican Senator Kit Bond announced he will not seek fifth term. Former House Majority Whip Roy Blunt announced his candidacy. Blunt benefited from strong fundraising numbers and President Obama's dismal approval ratings in Missouri. Secretary of State Robin Carnahan won the Democratic nomination. BLunt defeated Carnahan by a 54%-41% margin.

New Hampshire
Senior Republican Senator Judd Gregg, after withdrawing from a position in the Obama administration, announced he will not seek a fourth term. 2nd district Congressman Paul Hodes won the Democratic nomination, while Republicans nominated former New Hampshire Attorney General Kelly Ayotte. Ayotte defeated Hodes by a 60%-37% margin.

North Carolina
First-term Republican Richard Burr was considered vulnerable after Barack Obama won North Carolina's 15 electoral votes by a narrow margin, and Democrat Kay Hagan defeated Republican Senator Elizabeth Dole. It is also worth noting that no Senator has held this seat for more than one term since 1974. Secretary of State Elaine Marshall defeated former State Senator Cal Cunningham and Attorney Ken Lewis in the Democratic primary. Burr was reelected by a 55%-43% margin.

Ohio
Moderate Republican George Voinovich announced he would not seek a third term. Lieutenant Governor Lee Fisher won the Democratic nomination over Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner with 55% of the vote, a much closer margin than polls had shown.[22] Fisher received the endorsement of Democratic Governor Ted Strickland. Meanwhile, Republicans rallied behind Rob Portman, former Congressman and Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Although polls originally showed a tight race, Portman defeated Fisher by a 57%-39% margin.

Oklahoma
Tom Coburn was elected to a second term by a 71%-26% margin against Democrat Jim Rogers.

South Carolina
First-term Republican Jim DeMint, whose reputation as an outspoken conservative, has not hurt him in the Republican stronghold of South Carolina. Democrats nominated an unconventional candidate, Alvin Greene, an unemployed Army veteran who was indicted on criminal charges for showing pornographic pictures to a teenage college student.[23] DeMint defeated Greene by a 61%-28% margin.  

South Dakota
In 2004, John Thune defeated Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, and his victory quickly made him a rising star in the Republican Party. Thune ran unopposed in his reelection.[24]

Utah 
Three-term Senator Robert Bennett represents a state that John McCain won by over thirty-percentage points and was expected to win reelection by a comfortable margin. However, he was defeated in the Republican caucus to Mike Lee and Tim Bridgewater after his vote for TARP. Bennett ruled out a write-in campaign, and Lee went on to win the Republican primary and general election.

Governors
In the 2010 gubernatorial elections, the Democratic Party won five governorships held by retiring Republicans: California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Minnesota, and Vermont. The Republican Party won nine governorships from retiring Democrats: Kansas, Oklahoma, Maine, Michigan, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Wisconsin, Wyoming, and defeated two incumbents, Chet Culver of Iowa and Ted Strickland of Ohio. An Independent was elected Governor of Rhode Island to replace a retiring Republican, and a Republican was elected Governor of Florida to replace an Independent. Thus, Republicans had a net gain of six governorships, and the majority of Governors in the United States flipped from Democrat to Republican. Republicans also won the governorships of New Jersey and Virginia from the Democrats in the 2009 elections.

Democratic Gains
California
Incumbent Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger was prohibited from seeking reelection because of term-limits. Schwarzenegger was elected in 2003 after a recall of Governor Gray Davis and reelected in a landslide in 2006. However, Schwarzenegger's popularity, along with the Democratic assembly, fell because of the California budget crisis. State Attorney General and former Governor Jerry Brown won the Democratic nomination. On the Republican side, former Ebay CEO Meg Whitman defeated State Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner.
San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom was seeking the Democratic nomination, however dropped out in October 2009 after lackluster poll numbers and meager fund-raising receipts.[25] In the general election, Brown defeated Whitman by a 53%-42% margin.

Connecticut
M. Jodi Rell, despite being a Republican Governor from a blue state, was reelected with 63% of the vote in 2006 and had high approval ratings throughout her tenure as governor. However, she announced she would not run for another term.[26] Lieutenant Governor Michael Fedele announced his candidacy, but was defeated for the Republican nomination by former U.S. Ambassador Tom Foley. Democrats chose Stamford Mayor Dan Malloy over former U.S. Senate candidate Ned Lamont. After a recount, Malloy was confirmed to have won the governorship by a 50%-49% margin.

Hawaii 
Republican Governor Linda Lingle was term-limited. James Aiona, who served as the state's Lieutenant Governor eight years, ran to become her successor, but was defeated by 10-term Congressman Neil Abercrombie by a 58%-41% margin.

Minnesota
Two-term Governor Tim Pawlenty announced he would not seek another term, and became a potential 2012 GOP presidential candidate. Republican State Representative Tom Emmer and former Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Dayton won their parties nominations, respectively. After a recount, Dayton was confirmed to have won by a 0.5% margin.  

Vermont
Although a solidly Democratic state (Barack Obama won it with over 67% of the vote) Republican Jim Douglas was elected governor in 2002 and reelected in 2004, 2006, and 2008. Douglas announced he would not run for another term, and Republicans nominated Lieutenant Governor Brian Dubie. Democratic State Senator Peter Shumlin defeated Dubie by a 50%-48% margin in the general election.

Independent Gains
Rhode Island
Although Democrats have dominated Rhode Island politics, they have voted Republican for 7 of the last 10 gubernatorial elections. As Rhode Island was hit hard by the national recession, Republican Governor Donald Carcieri suffered in the polls, and was barred from seeking a third term because of term-limits. Lincoln Chafee, former Senator who was known as the most liberal Republican in Congress, was elected Governor as an Independent, defeating Republican John Robitaille and Democrat Frank Caprio. After President Obama refused to endorse Caprio, he caused controversy by telling Obama to take his endorsement and ""shove it."" [27]

Republican Gains
Florida
Republican turned Independent Governor Charlie Crist announced he would not seek a second term and instead run for the United States Senate, resulting in an open race. State Attorney General Bill McCollum was heavily favored to win the Republican nomination, but was defeated by Rick Scott, a millionaire health care executive and activist against federal health care legislation. Democrats nominated Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink, who led Scott in most of the polls following the primary. Scott's campaign emphasized conservative policies such as expanding school choice, abolishing the corporate income tax, and firing state employees.[28] He won the general election by a narrow 49%-48% margin. 

Iowa
Chet Culver, who was elected governor in 2006 riding on a Democratic wave, was defeated in a competitive reelection. Culver governed as a progressive in a swing state, increasing the minimum wage and raising the cigarette tax. His job approval ratings fell as the economy continued to falter. Former Governor Terry Branstad defeated Culver by a 53%-43% margin.

Kansas
Kathleen Sebelius, a Democratic Governor from the Republican-stronghold of Kansas, stepped down after being nominated to serve as Secretary of Health and Human Services in the Obama administration. Lieutenant Governor Mark Parkinson, a former Republican, took her place, and announced he would not seek a full term. Senator Sam Brownback was the Republican nominee, and defeated Democratic state Senator Tom Holland by a 63%-32% margin.

Maine
Democrat Governor John Baldacci was term-limited by state law, and Republicans saw it as an opportunity to gain the governorship. Republicans nominated Waterville, Maine Mayor Paul LePage, who defeated Independent candidate Eliot Cutler and Democratic state Senate President Libby Mitchell with a 38% plurarly. 

Michigan
Democratic Governor Jennifer Granholm suffered in her job approval ratings as the Michigan economy, heavily dependent of the auto industry, continued to falter throughout the 2000s.

Rick Snyder, easily defeated Democrat Lansing Mayor Virgil Bernero by a 58%-40% margin in the general election.

New Mexico
Democratic Governor Bill Richardson was nominated by President Obama to serve as Secretary of Commerce, however was forced to resign after it was exposed that his administration had a ""pay-to-play"" deal with a defense contractor. Richardson denied any wrongdoing.

The Republican nomination went to District Attorney Susana Martinez, and narrowly led in the polls throughout the campaign. She defeated Denish by a 54%-46% margin, becoming the first Hispanic woman elected governor in the United States. 

Ohio
Incumbent Democrat Ted Strickland faced sagging approval ratings and tough reelection prospects as Ohio lost jobs and population during his governorship. His Republican opponent, John Kasich – a former Congressman and Chairman of the House Budget Committee in the 1990s – campaigned on phasing out the state income tax, leasing the state's toll roads, cutting 15-20 percent of the state's higher education funds, and relaxing sentences on nonviolent offenders to cut down prison costs.[30] He defeated Strickland by a 49%-47% margin.

Oklahoma
Democratic Governor Brad Henry could not run for reelection because of term limits. Republicans nominated U.S. Representative Marry Fallin, who defeated Lieutenant Governor Jari Askins, becoming the first woman elected governor of Oklahoma.

Pennsylvania

He was reelected by a 65%-34% margin against former Republican State Senate Jim Keet, despite Republicans making strong inroads in the traditionally Democratic supporting Arkansas during the 2010 election.

Colorado 
Despite Democratic success in Colorado during the 2006 and 2008 elections, incumbent Governor Bill Ritter announced his retirement after the prospects of a difficult reelection. His policies of higher taxes and unionization of state employees earned him criticism from the business community, and his approval ratings fell to 45%.[31] Former Congressman Scott McInnis was favored to win the Republican nomination, however fell in the polls after a controversy regarding plagiarizing an article, and was defeated by businessman and political newcomer Dan Maes, who also received criticism for misrepresenting his law enforcement background in the 1980s. Meanwhile, former Congressman Tom Tancredo entered the race in the American Constitution Party, and surged towards the end of the campaign. The turmoil made is easier for Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper to hold the Governors office for the Democrats, and was elected 50% of the vote, to Tancredo's 37% and Maes 11%.

Illinois
Democratic Governor Pat Quinn was installed as governor after the impeachment of Rod Blagojevich, and announced he would seek a full term. Quinn narrowly won the Democratic nomination against State Comptroller Dan Hynes. State Senator Bill Brady won the Republican nomination, defeating State Senator Kirk Dillard, and former State GOP chair Andrew McKenna. In the general election, Quinn pulled somewhat of an upset, winning reelection by a 47%-46% margin.  

Maryland
Democrat Martin O'Malley will likely run for a second term in 2010. O'Malley's approval ratings fell to 33% after a series of tax increases. The race was expected to be competitive with former Governor Robert Ehrlich seeking a rematch, however O'Malley was reelected by 14 percentage points.    

Massachusetts

The Republican nominee was health care executive Charlie Baker. Patrick was reelected with a 48% plurality, with Baker receiving 42% and Independent Paul Loscocco 8%.

New York
After Democratic Governor Eliot Spitzer resigned in disgrace when it was revealed that he was involved in a prostitution ring, Lieutenant Governor David Paterson took office.

Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani declined to seek the governorship and endorsed former Congressman Rick Lazio. 
President Barack Obama in Sept. 2009 contacted Paterson, asking him not to seek reelection in 2010 in that he cannot recover from his dismal political standing. Democrats nominated a stronger candidate, State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo. Republicans nominated Tea Party favorite and real estate developer Carl Paladino. Polls originally showed a tightening race, however a series of missteps resulted in Cuomo being handedly elected with over 60-percent of the vote.  

Oregon

Alaska
Sarah Palin, one-term Governor and former Vice-Presidential nominee, resigned on July 3, 2009 and Lieutenant Governor Sean Parnell inherited the governorship.

Arizona 
After Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano was nominated by President Obama to serve as Secretary of Homeland Security, Arizona Secretary of State Janice K. Brewer, a Republican, succeeded her. She announced that she would seek a full term.[33] In the beginning of 2010, Brewer was considered to be one of the most vulnerable Republican Governors up for reelection. However, her popularity rose after signing a controversial illegal immigration law, and was reelected against state Attorney General Terry Goddard by a 55%-42% margin.

Georgia
In 2002, Sonny Perdue became the first Republican elected Governor of Georgia since reconstruction, and was reelected in 2006. However, he was term-limited in 2010.

Clark County Commissioner Rory Reid — son of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid - won the Democratic nomination. In the general election, Sandovalby defeated Reid by a 53%-42% margin.   

South Carolina
Republican Governor Mark Sanford's possible presidential ambitions for 2012 ended after it was exposed he was having an extramarital affair with a woman from Argentine. Sanford would not resign, however was barred from seeking a third term because of term limits. Both parties prepared for an open race.

Differences between 2008 and other elections
In 2008, CNN-YouTube held the first debate in which the questions asked of the nominees in each party came primarily from YouTube viewer submitted videos. The debates received high ratings, however, CNN was criticized for not picking questions that were 'tough' or pertinent enough. One such example was during the Democratic Debate, when CNN chose to ask a question from a snow man, talking about global warming. During the Republican debate, some claimed that many of the questions were from Democratic supporters just meant to embarrass the Republican candidates. For example, a question over whether or not homosexuals should serve in the U.S. military was asked by retired general and gay activist Keith Kerr, an adviser to Hillary Clinton's campaign. 
The internet has also played a major role in the election, with then-Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul and Democratic candidate Barack Obama being very active on the internet.

Young voters
In 2004, 64% of voters aged 18–29 were registered to vote.  This year 75% of voters in that age group are registered.  This demographic usually favors Democrats.

Fewer Uncommitted
Fewer people were undecided this election than in most previous elections.  As of the beginning of October, 2008 approximately 6-8% of poll respondents were undecided, an amount that continued to decline as the election drew closer.

Election Day
The turnout was about normal, except for higher than usual rates among blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and voters under 30—all Obama groups.  The turnout of evangelicals and whites was similar to 2004. There have been allegations of Democrats driving voters around to different voting stations, and as these are Obama groups, this would strengthen the voter turnout of this demographic.

McCain vs. Obama
McCain had the early edge, wrapping up the Republican nomination before Obama was known to be the choice of the Democrats, but this was one of the few advantages he has had.  Both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama raised far more money than McCain, and the Democratic primary saw a surge of new voters coming out leading to a large increase in the rolls of Democrats.  From the historical position of a generally equal number of Republicans and Democrats, the numbers have now tilted 41% Democrat to only 32% Republican.  From the time that Obama was declared the nominee, opinion polling showed him with a modest advantage over McCain in terms of who the voters would choose to be their next President.
Obama's strategy was to tie McCain to George Bush, a very unpopular President, even though McCain was not a part of the Bush administration and often clashed with Bush during his time as senator.  McCain, for his part, had to walk a fine line with accepting praise from the President to woo conservatives, while at the same time keeping enough distance so as to not alienate moderates.  When possible, McCain went after Obama's lack of foreign policy experience.
The trends heavily favored the Democrats, especially after their major gains in 2006.  Overall, Democrat candidates have a +10% advantage over Republicans in a 'generic' election - the current unpopular President is a Republican, and the economy is treading water.  Also, based on statistical percentages of articles on each candidate, Obama was being focused on by the press far more than McCain.  When McCain chastised Obama for his lack of foreign policy experience and that he hadn't been to Iraq or Afghanistan in years, Obama's campaign set up for him to take a trip to both countries.  While this is expected in politics, the decision of every major network to send a team of reporters to follow him was unprecedented.  Obama spoke to 200,000 people in Berlin in a highly covered speech.  McCain spoke to 50,000 in Buffalo shortly thereafter and barely got a whisper.  Obama's numbers started to rise, but a good deal of the populace was noticing the disparity as 48% of those polled felt the press was trying to help Obama win.
Obama seemed pleased to coast on his advantages, but McCain realized he needed to shake things up.  He scored by pushing offshore drilling for oil during a time when oil prices were climbing almost daily.  Obama rejected the idea, but the poll numbers started to show a greater percentage of Americans warming to the concept[2] and McCain's numbers started to improve.  Obama announced he would accept some measure of offshore drilling, and McCain's momentum was halted and his gains retreated by a couple of points.  McCain started an ad campaign that acknowledged Obama's celebrity status, but asking what it meant.  A few days later at the start of August he called out Obama for 'playing the race card' when Obama made a reference to McCain and Bush trying to scare people because he (Obama) doesn't look like other Presidents on dollar bills.  The Democrats fired back, but quickly let the issue drop when poll numbers showed that most voters did consider Obama's statement to be racist.[3]  The bounce for Obama after the Berlin speech shrank back to pre-trip levels.  While Obama continued to enjoy a slight lead in the polls, McCain continued to keep the race close without either candidate breaking away. 
In mid-August, both candidates came together at the invitation of Pastor Rick Warren where each was asked a series of the same questions dealing both with political and personal views.  While not a debate, it was the first televised forum where both candidates had a chance to express themselves and their positions.  Obama hoped to appeal to Christian conservatives by expressing a religious side while McCain hoped to solidify the conservative base by sharing his own conservative and religious credentials.  The difference in style between the two was evident as Obama spent more time explaining and expounding on his positions while McCain was more straightforward and received more laughs with his candid speaking style.  The polling numbers continued as they had been.
There was a bounce at the start of the Democratic convention, but not what was expected as McCain suddenly drew even in the race.  The friction between Hillary Clinton and Obama as well as the perceived slight of Hillary when Biden was chosen as the Vice Presidential candidate hurt Obama at a time when his approval was expected to climb.  McCain then made a mistake by airing an ad of Hillary Clinton that 'supported' him.  Clinton was set to speak at the convention and it was no secret that there was bad blood between her and Obama and it was widely believed that her support for Obama would be lukewarm at best.  Instead, apparently galvanized by McCain's hubris before her speech, she came out strongly for Obama and rallied those who supported her.  Obama's pre-convention edge returned.  Obama followed it up with a very strong speech the next day in a huge stadium with fireworks and a Greek temple.  Dick Morris, a former Bill Clinton political strategist who gave advice to the Republicans in 2008, felt that Obama had done such a good job reaching out to the groups that he needed that he would pull ahead by double-digits.  In order to suppress the bounce from the convention, McCain announced his Vice Presidential candidate the next day, a woman, Alaskan governor Sarah Palin.  The bounce for Obama was muted at first, but increased in the following days to surpass pre-convention levels, especially as Sarah Palin came under heavy attack in the media.
The edge continued as the Republican convention began.  Losing a day to the hurricane, their shortened convention came out strong as well, emphasizing John McCain as a patriot and a maverick for change who is tested and will do what is right for the country regardless of political affiliation.  It was notable for the secondary role that the sitting President played, talking only briefly and barely being mentioned after that.  The convention tied McCain to Ronald Reagan, a popular Republican President who was able to gain the support of a good number of conservative Democrats, an ability that McCain would badly need to emulate.  While the convention had very high ratings starting with Palin's well received speech, it was unclear what the impact would be in the polls.  Indeed, Obama continued to lead directly afterward, but that soon changed with a turn of about 8 points and a slim lead for McCain.  The Republican convention had actually more than balanced out the powerful Democratic convention.
While Obama had stated that his campaign would avoid negative advertising, as it became clear that the bounce from the convention was continuing to last and he might lose the election, his campaign turned more forcefully to negative advertising.  In ads aired since the Republican convention through mid September, McCain's ads were about Obama 56% of the time, but Obama's ads were about his opponents 77% of the time.[4]  Obama also received a large boost from the press which vigorously attacked McCain, but even more so Palin.  Obama appeared on The O'Reilly Factor and was treated with civility and respect, even if not with agreement.  McCain and his wife appeared on The View and were treated to openly antagonistic attacks.  The constant negative barrage and reporting slowly moved the numbers back to even.
As the negative articles on Palin continued to intensify, some of which just quoted celebrities who had never met her calling her ""whacko"" or a ""hater of women"", her first major interview with Gibson was a turning point.  Gibson asked Palin about the Bush Doctrine, but wouldn't define it for her even as she asked questions for clarifications.  When she then answered with her understanding, Gibson rebuked her by implying that she misunderstood the doctrine.  In truth, since the term is only a press invention, it has taken on different meanings at different times and the definition that Palin gave matched one that Gibson himself had used years earlier.  Nevertheless, it was a moment and was jumped on by the press.  Those who saw the interview voted heavily that they were now less likely to vote for Palin.  The attack on her had muted her effectiveness, even if it was unjustified.
Stemming the tide of the McCain campaign's lead became a strong swing for Obama with a series of events that went to the Democratic nominee's favor.  The polls began to tack to Obama's favor with the collapse of Lehman Brothers and a subsequent 500-point drop in the Dow Jones Index.  Then, President Bush sounded a major alarm on the economy and proposed a huge 700 billion dollar rescue plan for the mortgage industry, which sent shock waves through the American populace and swept them with even more fear on the economic picture.  Bush called both Presidential nominees to meet with him and Congress.  It gave Obama a boost in legitimacy, his previous Achilles' heel.  While he had a weak record in accomplishments and showing leadership, the chance to be propelled to a position of prominence handed it to him on a silver platter.  Moreover, the plan was more problematic among Republicans than it was among Democrats, giving Obama another boost merely by supporting it while putting McCain on more shaky ground.  Both candidates supported it once again blurring McCain's advantage in experience if both men were seen as interchangeable in their reaction.
McCain chose to suspend his campaign until a deal on the rescue package was reached, a mistake.  The Democrats could add pork to the plan and make it even more unpalatable to the Republicans, and they did.  As the first debate loomed and no deal had been reached, McCain was in a quandary.  He chose to attend the debate under the view that the plan was well under way to being passed.  After the debate the plan was actually defeated and wouldn't be adopted, with more changes, until the following week.
McCain's debate with Obama went well and he was viewed as having done better than expected.  Unfortunately for him, Obama was also viewed as doing better than expected and was seen as looking Presidential, further cementing his standing and locking in a lead in the polls that had become rather substantial.  The Vice Presidential debate was the most watched in history and Palin was given high marks for her performance, but unfortunately for the Republican ticket, Biden was also on his game that night and also came across well.  There were no changes in the polling numbers and the number of undecided voters began to quickly dwindle.  The second and third debates caused little change as well.
With Obama spending 110 million dollars on TV advertising in October alone, including 30 minute specials on each of the major networks, McCain was hard pressed to make up the necessary ground to win the election after being outspent by 3 to 1 for TV adds over that time period.  He couldn't count on regular TV to help put in a good word for him either, as late night political jokes are running at a pace of 7 jokes against McCain/Palin for every 1 joke against Obama/Biden and a study of news stories on McCain and Obama since the end of the conventions found that 57% of news stories about McCain were negative while only 29% were for Obama.[5]  A later study by the independent Pew Research Center found that the discrepancy had grown even worse.  McCain had 57% of the articles about him negative while only 14% were positive, while Obama had more positive articles than negative.  The only network to achieve a balance, 40% negative for both, was Fox News.[6]

General Strategy
McCain's team emphasized to convince the electorate of the long-term leadership and experience that John McCain has shown in two decades of government service while emphasizing the relative untested nature of Barack Obama.
Obama's team stressed that Obama is the candidate of fresh ideas while downplaying his relative inexperience compared to the more seasoned McCain.  When possible, McCain is lumped together with George Bush, an unpopular President.

Republican Strategy
With more limited funding than his Democratic rival, McCain had favored open town hall meetings to attract the greatest number of people.  He is focusing his advertising on swing states.  He also asked for open debates with Obama of the Lincoln-Douglas variety where candidates can talk directly to each other, but this was not accepted by the Democratic camp which prefers the current structured format.
McCain will highlight his record of leadership, his service to his country and stress that as President he can be counted on to keep America safe from outside threats.  McCain's strongest supporters are the elderly - the group that most wants stability.
McCain's choice of Sarah Palin as his Vice Presidential nominee was a departure from what was expected and helped to show that he would go down paths that the Republican party had not done in the past.  McCain has touted Palin's record of standing up to the Alaska Republican party when she resigned from an Ethics Commission in protest over a lack of ethics of fellow commissioners, as well as when she ran against, and beat, then-incumbent Governor Frank Murkowski in the Republican primary in 2006.  McCain will continue to tout her as a ""maverick"" to complement his own maverick image that he is trying to emphasize. Last, by choosing a female running mate, McCain hoped to pick up the votes of female voters disaffected with the perceived slight of Hillary Clinton by Obama.  Prior to the start of the Democratic convention, 30% of Hillary's supporters had still not backed Obama and there was a good deal of bad blood between the two.
With the unfolding of the campaign season and watching the Democratic strategy and how it was playing out in the press and polls, the McCain campaign decided not to cede the moniker of change to Obama, but rather to take it upon themselves by emphasizing that McCain has a track record of change - while Obama does not.  The McCain campaign feels it needs to have the voters ask who can be trusted more to get the job done, and if that occurs, then they have the advantage.
With the selection of Palin, and the energy it has brought to the conservative base, McCain has taken to larger rallies, as opposed to town hall meetings and press conferences.  By mid-September, he had gone four weeks without a town hall, and three weeks without a press conference, instead sticking to larger engagements, appearing alongside his vice presidential nominee, with larger crowds than he had experienced earlier in his campaign.

Democratic Strategy
Democrats are confident that the low popularity of President Bush and particularly Operation Iraqi Freedom, which John McCain supports, puts them in a highly favorable position for 2008.  They have been cautious in the Iraq arena realizing that 'The Surge' worked and they were on the wrong end of that issue.  Focus is being put on a timeline for troops coming home, a position that most of the American population favors.
Democrats believe it is their race to lose, but also realize they had a good chance to win the last two Presidential elections and came up short each time.  General wisdom also states that a poor economy favors Obama, so they will emphasize the dire times in this area.  As in past elections, differences between those who have obtained a high income level and those who have not will be emphasized. In fact, the Democratic strategy in many ways mirrors that of their strategy in 1992 when the Democrat-controlled Congress deliberately caused economic disruption, knowing full well that the public would blame sitting president George H.W. Bush, and thereby allowing Bill Clinton to win that year's presidential race.
Favored by the young, Democrats will try hard to encourage and get out the young vote, a task that has proven more difficult than expected in the last two election cycles.  To their advantage, Obama made his vice presidential pick via text message to cell phone numbers registered on the site.  The announcement went to 3 million cell phones, a useful database for ""Get Out The Vote"" (GOTV) efforts, when voters may not be home or reachable on their landline.
As an extension of the DNC's strategy in the 2006 elections, led by Howard Dean, Barack Obama has been working towards a ""50-state strategy.""  The campaign is working to place campaign offices throughout the country with a focus on voter registration.  The increase in the rolls of Democratic voters from the primary battle between Hillary Clinton and Obama played out well for the Democrats and puts pressure on Senator McCain even in typically red states, and more specifically, ""Lean Republican"" states, to use the Cook Political Report's term.  In addition, with a fundraising advantage, Obama is airing ads in those tight states forcing McCain to make decisions about whether to use funds to match ads and campaign efforts in those states or rely on historical results that those states will support him and focus funds in traditional toss-up states instead.

Fundraising
Barack Obama had a significant edge over Hillary Clinton in the fundraising department during their contest for the Democratic nomination, but both actually set records for raising money and both raised far more money than John McCain.  McCain didn't have to spend as much since he locked up the Republican nomination much earlier than Obama locked up the Democratic.  Both Obama and McCain said they would accept government funds—which would also cap how much the candidates could raise on their own—but Obama, who could presumably raise more through his own sources, changed his mind and later declined.  Much of McCain's war chest will come from the Republican Party in general, which has more money to spend than their Democratic counterparts.  McCain's campaign raised $47 million in August, a very sizable figure for him so far and a personal record, but not as strong as Obama's best months. In the same time period, Obama set a record with $66 million. Obama, still having an edge in fundraising that has continued throughout his run for the Presidency, saw $10 million collected the day after Sarah Palin's strongly received convention speech, a new one day record.[7]  The Palin announcement has been good for John McCain's fundraising as well.
Obama set a new record of $150 million raised in September and over $600 million overall.[8]  Obama's camp does not release information on who contributes to the campaign.


Conventions
Democratic National Convention
For a more detailed treatment, see 2008 Democratic National Convention.
The 2008 Democratic National Convention was held in Denver, Colorado, from August 25 to August 27 at Pepsi Center. There, Senator Obama and his running mate were selected to be the party nominee's. Barack Obama will accepted the party's nomination in front of a crowd of more than 75,000 in a free, open event held at INVESCO Field at Mile High, in a platform resemblant to a Greek temple. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is the Permanent Chair of the Convention.
The convention had a rocky start as friction between supporters of Obama and the Clintons was not resolved.  Instead of Obama getting a bump in the polls, his support actually declined.  The Democrats also seemed to be at odds on finding a unifying strategy for how hard to attack John McCain and how to present it.  As Democratic pundit James Carville said in an interview on CNN, ""If this party has a message, it's done a <heck> of a job hiding it tonight, I promise you that.""[9]
A bleak convention was turned around by the Clintons. Infighting between Obama and Hillary continued through the day of her speech, but a comprise was reached, and, beyond expectations, she gave a rousing speech for Obama - possibly as an angry response to McCain's latest ad that showed her 'supporting' him. Bill Clinton the next night also praised Obama, something that he failed to effectively do in 2000 for Al Gore when he centered on his accomplishments and gave little more than lip service to Gore with statements amounting to 'and Al Gore was there too'. The convention, possibly remembering that, gave him the topic he was to speak on instead of choosing his own. Clinton was angered, but it worked. He came through. By the time Obama spoke on the last night, the theme that was missing at first was clear, and Obama mixed a message of attacking McCain with the need for change and even outlining some expensive programs that would appeal to the target populace who has been lukewarm to him. From a political point of view, the convention did what it was supposed to.


Republican National Convention
For a more detailed treatment, see 2008 Republican National Convention.
The 2008 Republican National Convention was held in Saint Paul, Minnesota from September 1 (Labor Day) until September 4. The presumptive nominee was Senator McCain. The location has political significance in that Minnesota will likely be a close state during the general election, as will its neighboring states Wisconsin and Iowa.
The convention schedule had to be altered due to the upcoming landfall of Hurricane Gustav. The first day almost entirely focused on raising money for Hurricane relief.  This led to a shortened three day convention instead of four and there was some shuffling of who was speaking on which day to accommodate the suddenly shortened time span.  In a surprise, George W. Bush was only delivered an eight-minute speech by satellite.  In another surprise Sarah Palin's speech was watched by as many people as saw Obama give his acceptance speech on the closing night of the Democratic convention, as over 40 million people tuned in.[10]  She was considered the highlight of the convention, even surpassing John McCain's speech the next day, and was noted for doing an exceptional job.  Recognizing the strong asset that they have in her, the Republicans made reference to her many times on the last day of the convention.  McCain, not known for being comfortable reading prepared speeches in a convention hall, delivered a solid speech.  While Obama continued to enjoy a lead in the polls, it changed quickly thereafter to a slight McCain-Palin edge.  The Republican convention more than canceled out a very powerful Democratic convention.

Leftist violence
 Poster circulated by community organizers. Other posters depicted rock throwers with the caption, ""Shut Down the RNC!,"" dead elephants, and derogatory and demeaning comments about gay Republicans. [2]
Progressives for Obama shares a huge membership overlap with the Movement for a Democratic Society (MDS), a group of former Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) members and sympathisers. MDS re-founded SDS in 2006 for a new generation of college students and functions as a support group for SDS's 130 college chapters. Independent researcher Trevor Louden refers to MDS as ""the brains behind the SDS brawn.""  The reconstituted SDS was very prominent in the violence at the Republican National Convention at St Paul.[11] The founder of ACORN, Wade Rathke, denouncd[12] an FBI informer who foiled a terrorist plot to kill delegates at the Republican Convention.[13]

Vice Presidential Candidates
Democratic Vice-Presidential Candidate
On August 23, Senator Barack Obama announced, via text message to 3 million cell phone numbers of his supporters, his nomination of Joseph Biden to Vice President.  Biden's selection was considered to be a prudent move by Obama, filling a hole in his own foreign policy experience that McCain could exploit.  With the implosion of John Edwards, Biden was widely expected to be the choice.  In order to help build up suspense, Biden said he was not chosen when he spoke to the press the day before, only to be shown as the Vice Presidential candidate the next day.  A long-term senator and Washington insider with over two decades of service in the Senate, his earlier 1988 plagiarism scandal and frequent gaffes (including one in which he insulted Obama in a racist manner during the 2008 election) were deemed to be less negative than the positive that his strong experience credentials could bring to the race.  

 Joseph Biden




Republican Vice-Presidential Candidate
 thumb
Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska was announced as John McCain's choice early on Friday, August 29, the day after the Democratic convention ended.  A surprise choice not even considered by the press to be on McCain's short list, her selection caught the political world off guard.  It had been expected that Mitt Romney would earn the honor, but McCain had other ideas.  At first denigrated by the people in the Obama campaign, Obama's own statement was one of cautious neutrality to feel out what impact her selection would have on the race.


In an interesting twist, the selection of the Vice Presidential candidates changed the dynamics of the race.  By Obama picking Biden, he helped to fill the hole that McCain had been attacking dealing with a lack of foreign policy experience.  McCain's strongest point, experience, would lose some of its luster.  But the selection of Biden, and the passing over of Hillary Clinton, left another opening.  By aligning himself with someone who has been a Democratic stalwart, Obama's claim to change became less pronounced.  McCain seized upon that to select a Vice President that no one expected, and a woman, and steal some of the Democratic thunder.  Her lack of foreign policy experience would cut into the experience angle that had been in play earlier, but her own maverick streak in becoming governor by ousting another Republican, combined with John McCain's maverick choice in selecting her led to a new emphasis on McCain's own maverick past. Palin arguably had more ""executive"" / managerial experience than either McCain, Biden or, notably, Obama.  Suddenly he saw an opportunity to steal the moniker of change that Obama had been wearing, and he went for it.  Such a change in position occurring from the Vice Presidential selection is rare in Presidential politics.

Debates
Presidential Debates
For a more detailed treatment, see 2008 Presidential Debates.
There have been three presidential debates for the 2008 election season.  The first debate on September 26 discussed ""Foreign Policy & National Security"" and also dealt at length with the economic crisis. The result was a statistical draw where both candidates did better than expected in the eyes of the public.  The longer term impact worked out well for Obama who already had a lead going in, and benefited from solidifying that position.
The second debate on October 7, followed a town hall-style.  The questions came from audience members and the Internet, as chosen by the moderator.  Again the result was a statistical draw as far as who was considered to be the winner.  But with time running out for McCain, he needed something to make the people move his way, and that required a clear breakthrough that never happened
The final debate was held on October 15 concerned ""Domestic and Economic Policy."" Both candidates were again viewed as having done well, which was a tactical defeat for McCain as the poll numbers showed only small changes.

Vice Presidential Debate
There was one vice presidential debate held on October 2.  Palin did much better than expected, but Biden was also in top form.  No clear winner emerged and the poll numbers remained largely unchanged, a strategic win for the Democratic ticket that only had to maintain their lead to win the election.  The number of people who watched the debate was an alltime record for a Vice Presidential debate, and was viewed by more people than any of the three Presidential debates.

Third parties and Independents
As usual there were a number of third party candidates, but none made much of an impact.  Briefly the Libertarian Bob Barr had enough strength to become a spoiler for McCain.  He faded quickly. See United States Presidential Election, 2008 -- Third Party Candidates.

Primaries
For expanded primary information, see United States Presidential Election, 2008 - Primaries
The primary season for both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party officially began on January 3, 2008 with the Iowa Caucuses and ended on June 3, 2008.[14]  The 2008 election cycle saw a major shift in the primary election calendar, frontloading many primaries into early February.[15]
John McCain had to get his footing at first, but was pretty much assured the Republican nomination after Super Tuesday.  Barack Obama had a much tougher road, but rode out a string of victories in February to eventually outlast Clinton and take the nomination.  During that time he had raised more money than any other candidate in history giving him a huge boost, a trend that would continue into the general election.

Analysis


1

Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,

From: Paul, who was called by God's will to be one of Jesus Christ's apostles, and our brother Sosthenes




2

Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:

To: The church of God at Corinth, those sanctified in Jesus Christ, called to be church members, along with all those everywhere who, along with them and us, pray to our Lord Jesus Christ.




3

Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

Grace and peace to you, from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.




4

I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;

I always thank God for the grace of God which is given to you by Jesus Christ,




5

That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;

And I also thank God that he gives you so much help in your words and knowledge.




6

Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:

Even as you have had confirmation of the testimony of Christ,




7

So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:

You are not lacking any gifts as you wait for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,




8

Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Who will continue to give you confirmation until the end, so that you will be free of blame when He does come.




9

God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.

God keeps his word, and it is by Him that you were called into the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ our Lord.




10

Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.

Now I beg you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you speak with one voice, that you let there be no divisions among you, that you be perfectly joined together with unanimous judgment.




11

For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.

Chloe's relatives have told me that you, my brothers, have some contentiousness among you.




12

Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.

I'm saying that you all are saying, ""I'm a follower of Paul"" or ""I'm a follower of Apollos"" or ""I'm a follower of Peter"" or ""I'm a follower of Christ.""




13

Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?

Is Christ divided?  Was I crucified for you, or were you baptized in my name?




14

I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;

Thank God I didn't baptize any of you but Crispus and Gaius,




15

Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.

Or else some would be saying that I had been baptizing in my own name!




16

And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.

Oh, I also baptized Stephanas's family; other than that, I don't know if I baptized anyone else.




17

For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.

In any case, Christ didn't send me to baptize.  He sent me to preach the gospel, but not with the kind of liberal claptrap that would make Christ's sacrifice ineffectual.

Previously translated as ""substanceless words,"" but ""liberal claptrap"" is more contemporary and closer to the original meaning; notice how far off the NASB and NIV translations are from the obvious meaning of this verse.


18

For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.

To those who are going to Hell, preaching about Jesus is nonsense, but to those of us who are going to Heaven, that preaching is the power of God.




19

For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.

In scripture, God says, ""I will destroy the wisdom of those who think they are wise and reduce to nothing the understanding of those who think they are well-informed.""




20

Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?

Where are the ""wise"", the ""well-educated,"" and the debater?  Hasn't God made their wisdom of the world look pretty foolish now?




21

For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.

Since the pseudowisdom of the world didn't know anything about God, it is amusing to God that the so-called foolishness of our preaching is what saves us believers.




22

For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:

For example, the Jews expect to see a sign from heaven, and the Greeks demand demonstrations of ""wisdom.""




23

But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;

But what we preach is the crucifixion of Christ.  For the Jews, this is a scandal and for the Greeks it's moronic.

Transliterating as well as translating σκάνδαλον and μωρίαν.


24

But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.

But to those who listen to us, whether Jewish or Greek, what we preach is the power and the wisdom of God.




25

Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.

They know that this ""foolishness"" of God is wiser than men; the ""weakness"" of God is stronger than men.




26

For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:

My brothers, think about your own experience of being called to Christ.  Not many wise (by worldly standards), not many powerful, not many high-born are called.




27

But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;

God chose the things the world considers foolish in order to confuse the wise, and the things the world considers weak in order to weaken the strong.




28

And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:

And God chose the things the world considers low and despicable, and things which are not, to bring to nothingness the things that are




29

That no flesh should glory in his presence.

So that nobody can be proud in His presence.




30

But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:

It's a gift of God that you are with Jesus Christ, whom God made our wisdom, morality, holiness, and redemption.




31

That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.

So, as it as says in scripture, if you're going to be proud about anything, be proud about the Lord.

Analysis


1

And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.

My brothers, when I came to you to testify about God, I didn't come speaking with fancy words or wisdom.




2

For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.

I had decided that among you I didn't need to know about anything except Jesus Christ and his crucifixion.




3

And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.

When I was with you, I was weak and trembling with fear.




4

And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:

And when I spoke and preached, it wasn't with attractive words of human ""wisdom"", but it did demonstrate God's power




5

That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.

So that your faith would be not in human ""wisdom"" but in the power of God.




6

Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:

However, we speak with real wisdom among those whose understanding is complete, but it isn't the ""wisdom"" of this world, and it isn't the ""wisdom"" of the rulers of this world, who come to nothing.




7

But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:

We speak the wisdom of God as a mystery, even the secret wisdom which God selected before the world for our glory.




8

Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.

None of the rulers of this world knew this wisdom; if they had known it, they wouldn't have crucified our glorious Lord.




9

But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.

But as it says in scripture, no eye has seen, no ear has heard, no heart has understood, the things that God has waiting for those who love him.




10

But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.

But God has shown those things to us by his spirit, which searches out all things, even the deepest things of God.




11

For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.

After all, who knows the things of a man other than the that man's own spirit?  In the same way, no man knows the things of God, but the Spirit of God does.




12

Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.

Now we have received a spirit—Not the world's, but God's, so that we can know the things that God has freely given to us.




13

Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.

These things are what we're talking about—Not in the words that man's ""wisdom"" uses to teach, but which the Holy Spirit teaches.  We're talking spiritual things with the spiritual.




14

But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.

Now, a natural man, on the one hand, doesn't understand the things of the Spirit of God.  He thinks they are all nonsense.  He can't understand them because they must be understood supernaturally.




15

But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.

But a spiritual man, on the other hand, can judge everything, but he can't be judged by other men.




16

For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.

One might ask, who has known the mind of the Lord and can teach Him?  Well, we have the mind of Christ.

Analysis


1

And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.

My brothers, previously I couldn't speak to as if you were spiritual.  I had to speak to you in the terms of the world, as if you were immature in your understanding of Christ.




2

I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.

I had to feed you with milk, not solid food; you weren't ready for it then, and you aren't ready for it now.




3

For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?

You are still of this world.  Among you, there is envy, quarrelling, and division, so aren't you worldly?  Aren't you going about like men?




4

For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?

When one of you says, ""I follow Paul"" and another says ""I follow Apollos"" isn't that worldly of you?




5

Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?

Who is this Paul?  Who is this Apollos?  Just ministers who led you to believe, as the Lord gave to every man.




6

I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.

I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God made it grow.




7

So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.

So neither the planter nor the waterer is anything, but God, the grower, is everything.




8

Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.

Now the planter and the waterer are one, and every man will get an appropriate reward for his work.




9

For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.

We are workers together with God; you are God's field, you are God's building.




10

According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.

With the grace of God I've been given, as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation, and someone else will build on it.  But be careful how you build.




11

For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.

There can be no foundation other than the one I laid, that is, Jesus Christ.




12

Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;

Now if any man builds on this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw,




13

Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.

His work will be seen clearly when it is declared on the day of judgment because it will be revealed with fire.  That fire will test every many's work to see what kind of work it is.




14

If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.

If any man's building work lasts, he will get his reward.




15

If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.

If his work is burned, that is a loss to him, but he himself will be saved, although it will be like going through fire.




16

Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?

Don't you know that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God lives in you?




17

If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.

If any man desecrates the temple of God, God will destroy him, for the temple of God is holy, and that temple is you.

""defile"" is archaic; ""desecrates"" is the modern equivalent, and this command applies directly against performing abortion.


18

Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.

Don't deceive yourselves.  If any man among you seems to be wise in this world, let him become a fool so that he can actually become wise.




19

For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.

As far as God is concerned, the wisdom of this world is foolishness.  As it says in scripture, God catches the ""wise"" in the trap of their own craftiness.




20

And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.

And again, the Lord knows the thoughts of the ""wise""; he knows that they are useless.




21

Therefore, let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;

So to summarize, don't take pride in men. Everything is yours--




22

Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;

Paul, Apollos, or Peter, the world, life, or death, things present, things to come—It is all yours.




23

And ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.

And you are Christ's, and Christ is God's.

1

Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.

So people should think of us as the ministers of Christ and the stewards of God's mysteries.




2

Moreover, it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.

Of course, in order to be a steward, a man has to be considered faithful.




3

But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.

As for me, it is insignificant that you or other men should judge me.  I don't even judge myself.




4

For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.

I don't know anything by myself, but I still don't have sufficient justification.  The Lord is the one that judges me.




5

Therefore, judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.

So don't judge things before the time when the Lord comes.  He will bring to light the things that are hidden in darkness and will make clear what is in men's hearts.  That will be the time when God will let men have praise.




6

And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.

To make my point, my brothers, I have used myself and Apollos as examples for your benefit, so that you can learn from our example not to place men above scripture, and so that you don't get into conflicts over inflating yourselves.




7

For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?

Who makes you different from other people?  What do you have that you didn't get as a gift from God?  And if you did get it as a gift from God, why act so proud as if it weren't a gift?




8

Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.

You now have all you need!  You are rich!  You have become kings without us!  Or so you think.  I wish you really were kings so that we could reign with you.




9

For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.

I think God has put us apostles at the end of the line, as if we were going to our deaths.  We're a spectacle for the world, for angels and for men.




10

We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised.

As you seem to think, we are fools for Christ, and you are wise in Christ; we are weak, and you are strong; you are honorable, and we are despised.




11

Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;

Even up to right now, we both are hungry and thirsty, we don't have enough clothing, we get beaten, and we have no place to stay.




12

And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:

We work with our own hands.  When people revile us, we bless them; when we are persecuted we endure it.




13

Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day.

When we are defamed, we speak politely, even when we are portrayed as the scum of the earth and all the world's trash until now.




14

I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.

I'm not writing this to make you ashamed, but to warn you as my beloved sons.




15

For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.

Even if you have ten thousand people to teach you about Christ, you don't have many fathers.  I was the one who begat you in Christ Jesus through the Gospel




16

Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.

This is why beg you to follow my example.




17

For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.

To this end, I've sent you Timotheus, my beloved son.  He is faithful in the Lord and will help you remember my Christly ways, just as I teach everywhere in every Church.




18

Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.

Now some of you are getting too full of yourselves, as if I wasn't going to come to you.




19

But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.

Well, I'm coming back soon, if the Lord is willing, and I'm going to know, not the words of those arrogant people, but their power.




20

For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.

God's kingdom isn't about talk.  It's about power.




21

What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?

So which do you prefer?  Should I come to see you carrying a big stick, or with love and in the spirit of meekness?

1

It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.

I have heard reports that there is sexual immorality among you, and I mean the kind of sexual immorality not found even among non-church members, between a man and his father's wife.




2

And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.

And you are proud?  Shouldn't you instead mourn and excommunicate the person who did this deed?




3

For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,

Even though I'm absent in body, I'm with you in spirit, and I have already judged, as though I were there, regarding the person who did this deed.

6

Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?

Your pride is not a good thing.  Don't you know that one rotten apple spoils the whole barrel?




7

Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:

So get rid of the rotten apple, so that you can be a new barrel, since you are unspoiled.  Christ, our passover lamb, is sacrificed for us.




8

Therefore, let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.

So let's have our feast, not with the old fruit or with rotten malice and corruption, but with the fresh apples of sincerity and truth.




9

I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:

I wrote to you in a previous letter not to associate with the sexually impure.




10

Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.

I wasn't referring to non-church members who were sexually impure, or greedy, or those who extort or worship idols.  If that's what I had meant, you would have to leave the world entirely.




11

But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.

What I'm writing to you to say now is not to associate with any man who calls himself a church member but is sexually immoral or greedy, or an idol worshipper, or uses harsh words, or an alcoholic, or a cheater.  Don't even eat with that kind of person.




12

For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?

What is it to me to judge those who are outside the church?  But don't you judge those who are inside it?




13

But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore, put away from among yourselves that wicked person.

Those outside the church, God will judge.  So, kick that immoral person out and keep him away from you.

1

Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?

Do any of you, if you have a complaint against another, dare to bring your dispute to the unjust for adjudication, instead of taking it up with church members?




2

Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?

Don't you know that the church members will judge the world?  And if you church members are going to judge the whole world, are you incapable of judging minor matters?




3

Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?

Don't you know that we are going to judge the angels?  Of course we can judge everything involving this life.




4

If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.

If you have judgments of things in this life, why not choose as your judges those who are least esteemed in the church?




5

I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?

I'm trying to make you ashamed with my words.  Is there really no wise man among you, not even one who can judge a dispute between his brothers?




6

But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.

Instead, one church member takes a fellow member to court to be judged by unbelievers.




7

Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?

So absolutely yes, there is a problem among you; you're taking one another to court!  Wouldn't it be better to tolerate a wrong?  Wouldn't you rather allow yourself to be cheated?




8

Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.

But no, you're wronging and cheating your own brothers in the church.




9

Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,

Don't you know that the unrighteous are not going to go to heaven.  Don't fall for deceit: neither the promiscuous, nor idol worshipers, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals,

Paul admonishes against homosexuality again here


10

Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.

Nor thieves, nor greedy people, nor alcoholics, nor people who speak ill of others, nor cheaters, are going to go to heaven.




11

And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.

And some of you were those things, but you are washed, you are made holy, you are made right, in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God.

Paul endorses the equivalent of conversion therapy here.


12

All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.

Even if everything is permitted to me, not everything is useful; even if everything is permitted to me, I won't be controlled by anything.




13

Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.

Food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food, but God will destroy both of them.  The body is not for sexual immorality; it's for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body.




14

And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.

And God raised Jesus from the dead and will also raise us from the dead by his power.




15

Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.

Don't you know that your bodies are parts of Christ's body?  Should I take the parts of Christ's body and make them parts of a whore's body?  God forbid.




16

What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.

Of course you know, don't you, that a person joined to a whore makes one body?  As God himself says, ""Two will be one body.""




17

But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.

But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.




18

Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that commiteth fornication sinneth against his own body.

Stay away from sexual immorality.  Other sins are outside the body, but when you are sexually impure you sin against your own body.




19

What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?

Of course you know, don't you, that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, given to you from God; that you are not your own?




20

For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.

You have been bought with a high price by Jesus's sacrifice, so honor God in your body and in your spirit.  They are God's, not yours.

Analysis


1

Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.

Now, as for the matter you wrote to me about: It is best to practice abstinence.




2

Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.

But in order to avoid sexual immorality, it is acceptable for each man to have a wife and each woman a husband.




3

Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.

The husband should give his wife what she needs, and the wife should do the same for her husband.




4

The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.

The wife is not in charge of her own body; her husband is.  Likewise, the husband isn't in charge of his own body; his wife is.




5

Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.

Don't hold out on one another, except temporarily by mutual consent so that you can fast and pray.  Then come together again, so that Satan doesn't have a chance to tempt you for trying to hold out longer than you can.




6

But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.

You're allowed to do what I'm saying, but it's not mandatory.




7

For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.

If I had my way, all men would be the way I am.  But every man is given gifts from God that are appropriate for him, one like this, another like that.




8

I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.

So I say to the unmarried and the widowed, it is best for them to remain celibate as I do.




9

But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.

But if they can't hold back, let them marry; it is better to marry than to go to Hell.




10

And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:

And to the married, I order this—No, wait, it's not me, but the Lord who says this—A wife should not leave her husband.




11

But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.

But if she does leave, she should remain unmarried or else go back to her husband.  And a husband should not throw out his wife.




12

But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.

As for the rest of you, I'm saying this, not the Lord: If a church member has a wife who isn't a believer and she is happy to stay with him, he should not kick her out.




13

And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.

And as for a woman who has a husband who isn't a believer, if he is happy to stay with her, she should not leave him.




14

For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.

After all, the unbelieving husband is made holy by his wife, and the unbelieving wife is made holy by the husband.  Otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.




15

But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.

But if the unbeliever leaves the marriage, let him leave.  A church member is not bound in such cases; God has called us to be in peace.




16

For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?

How do you women know whether you will be the one to save your husband?  Or how do you men know whether you will be the one to save your wife?




17

But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.

Anyway, whatever God has given evey man, however God has called every man, let him follow that path.  This is my ruling for all churches.




18

Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.

Is a man who is called circumcised?  He doesn't need to become uncircumcised.  Is anyone who is called uncircumcised?  Then he doesn't need to be circumcised either.




19

Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.

Circumcision is nothing and so is uncircumcision.  Keeping God's commandments is everything.




20

Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.

Every man should stay in the same circumstances he was in when he was called.




21

Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.

Were you called when you were a slave?  Don't worry about that, but if you can become free, do that instead.




22

For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's servant.

He who was called to the Lord when a slave is the Lord's freeman, and he who is called when free is Christ's slave.




23

Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.

You were bought with a price so don't be the slaves of men.




24

Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.

Brothers, let every man, wherever he was when he was called, stay there with God.




25

Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.

Now as for virgins, I have no commandment to relay from the Lord, but I can give my own judgment since, thanks to the Lord, I am trustworthy.




26

I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.

So I suppose I can say that it is good, given the present difficulties, for a man to be as he is now.




27

Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.

Are you married?  Then don't try to free yourself.  Are you free of a wife? Then don't try to get one.




28

But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless, such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.

But if you do get married, it's not a sin, and if a virgin gets married, it's not a sin.  However, if you do get married, you're in for a lot of trouble here and now, and I'm trying to save you from that.




29

But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;

I'm saying this, brothers:  Time is short.  While that little time remains, let those who have wives be as if they didn't,




30

And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;

And those who weep, as if they didn't, and those that are happy as if they weren't, and those that buy things as if they had nothing,




31

And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away.

And those who make use of this world, as not obsessed with it, for the things of this world will pass away.

καταχρώμενοι literally ""completely using"" doesn't seem idiomatic here, but neither does ""abusing.""
try the more idiomatic ""as not obsessed with it""



32

But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:

I would like for you to be carefree.  An unmarried man cares about the things that are the Lord's, that is, he cares about how to please the Lord.




33

But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.

But a married man cares about the things of this world, that is, he cares about how to please his wife.




34

There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.

There is also a difference between a married woman and a virgin.  The unmarried woman cares about the things that are the Lord's, so that she can be holy both in body and in spirit, but a married woman cares about the things of the world, that is, she cares about how to please her husband.




35

And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.

I'm saying this for your own benefit, not just to impose restrictions on you, but for the sake of what is appropriate, so that you can follow the Lord without distraction.




36

But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.

But if any man thinks that he is behaving inappropriately toward his betrothed, if she is losing her prime, and it is necessary, let him do what he wants to do; it isn't a sin.  Let them get married.




37

Nevertheless, he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.

But the man who remains steadfast in his heart without feeling compulsion, keeping self-control over his will, having decided in his heart to keep his betrothed as a virgin, also is doing a good thing.




38

So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.

So then, a man who gives his daughter in marriage is doing a good thing, but a man who doesn't do so is doing a better thing.




39

The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.

A wife is legally bound as long as her husband is alive, but if he is dead, she is free to marry anyone she wants, as long as he is a church member.




40

But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.

But she would be happier if she remained unmarried, at least according to my judgment, and I think my judgment is informed by the Spirit of God.

1

Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.

Now, on to the matter of things sacrificed to idols.  We know that we all have knowledge.  Knowledge inflates, but love builds solidly.




2

And if any man think that he knoweth anything, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.

And if a man thinks he knows anything, he doesn't know what he ought to know.




3

But if any man love God, the same is known of him.

But if a man loves God, God knows that.




4

As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.

So, as I was saying on the topic of eating things sacrificed to idols.  We know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is no god but the one God.




5

For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)

Although there are many that are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, many gods, and many lords,




6

But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.

To is there is only one God, the Father, from whom everything comes and for whom we live, and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom everything comes, and through whom we live.




7

Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.

But not everyone has this knowledge.  Some people are accustomed to idols even now, and eat food that has been offered to idols, and because their custom is weak, it is defiled.




8

But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.

But food does not call us to God.  In this respect, if we eat, we're no better off, and if we don't eat, we're no worse off.




9

But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.

But be careful lest this freedom of yours somehow become a stumbling block to those who are weak.




10

For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;

You understand this, but if you are seen eating in the temple of the idols, won't a weak man's conscience be emboldened to eat things offered to idols?




11

And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?

So because of your knowledge, should a weak church member, for whom Christ died, be destroyed?




12

But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.

When you sin like this against your fellow church members and woound their weak conscience, it is Christ that you are sinning against.




13

Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.

So if eating food causes a scandal for a brother church member, I won't eat mean any more so that I don't cause a scandal.

2010 Elections,https://www.conservapedia.com/2010_Elections," In the 2010 Midterm Elections, the Republican Party gained 63 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and six seats in the U.S. Senate from the Democratic Party. Republicans also gained six governorships, including Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan.  Republicans gained 680 seats in state legislatures, the most in the modern era.[1]
Republicans gained the most House seats since the 1938 Midterm Elections, giving Republicans their biggest House majority, and Democrats their smallest minority, since 1946.  When blue dog Democrats are added to the Republicans on certain issues like gun control or marriage, the Republican majority is even greater than in 1946.
Democratic loses could be attributed to public rejection of the socialistic policies of the Obama administration. The public disapproved of President Obama's economic policies. In the days leading up to the election, a majority of voters supported repealing/replacing The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, sixty-five percent of voters said that the economic stimulus package either hurt the economy or did no good,[2] and fifty-four percent of those voting said they were dissatisfied with the performance of Barack Obama. Given the high level of Democratic success in the 2006 and 2008 elections, they were also put in the position of having to defend a large number of seats.
John Boehner (R-Ohio), become Speaker of the House in the 112th Congress, exchanging places with Nancy Pelosi (D-California). By tradition Pelosi would be expected to resign her leadership position after such a stunning repudiation by the electorate, but as a self-centered liberal she insisted on becoming the next Minority Leader.

2009 elections
In the Nov. 3, 2009, off-year elections, defeat was the fate of Democrats in New York City, New Jersey and Virginia. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent, spent his way to a third term in New York City while Republican Bob McDonnell won in a landslide for governor of Virginia; in New Jersey Republican Christopher Christie ousted the incumbent Democrat Jon Corzine despite his millions and Obama's campaigning.
Conservatives scored a major internal party victory in Oct. 2009 by forcing the Republican candidate Dede Scozzafava out of a House race in New York's 23rd district, for being too liberal. The Conservative Party candidate was defeated by the Democrat, however, opening up recriminations between GOP officials and conservatives on why the district was lost for the first time since 1992. Conservative activists zeroed in on the 2010 race for Florida's open Senate seat, in which the Republican party Senate campaign committee endorsed moderate Gov. Charlie Crist but the more conservative Marco Rubio mounted a successful challenge. ""If I were Charlie Crist in Florida, what's happening in New York 23 would make me extremely nervous,"" GOP strategist Todd Harris said. ""A lot of the establishment Republicans underestimated the grass-roots anger across the country about spending and the expansion of the federal government. The anger is boiling over now, but a lot of the seeds of discontent were planted over the last five to six years.""[3]

Ad campaigns
 Cartoonist Michael Ramirez of Investor's Business Daily captures the tone of the 2010 Midterm elections.
In late 2009 national money was being poured into nine districts, where Democrats who voted for their party's health care reform may be in trouble. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, representing business, has spent at least $1.6 million in November.  Liberals shoot back against the Chamber and 60 Plus Association with ads targeting 12 Democrats and one Republican who supported health reform. Three liberal groups, Americans United for Change and the labor unions AFSCME and SEIU are teaming up for $1.75 million worth of counter-messaging on broadcast and cable TV in the districts of Reps. Berry, Cao, Connolly, Donnelly, Ellsworth, Hill, Hodes, Michaud, Murphy, Perriello, Pomeroy, Snyder and Titus.
In mid-October the Democratic National Committee, echoing charges debunked[4] by the New York Times, insinuated that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce was using ""foreign money"" to fund ads criticizing Democrats. The president said in a Maryland stump speech, ""we learned that one of the largest groups paying for these ads regularly takes in money from foreign corporations. So groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence American elections, and they won't tell you where the money for their ads comes from…. This is a threat to our democracy."" 
The president himself has received $543,219 from Swiss banking giant UBS AG,[5] a foreign banking corporation which was later fined a record $780 million for its part in helping the rich evade U.S. income taxes.[6] Columnist Ruben Navarrette warned the pitfalls of playing the ""foreign card"" is



 “

 both offensive and dangerous. It exploits people's fears of the unknown and appeals to the prejudice that many of us feel toward those who are different. It also fuels ugly nativist instincts that -- once unleashed -- can do real damage....Democrats know this better than anyone ... The birther movement, which suggests that Obama was actually born in Kenya and thus not eligible to serve as a president, is all about playing the foreign card...[7]

 ”


Commentator Charles Krauthammer called the unfounded attacks on the Chamber of Commerce a baseless McCarthyite smear,[8] while columinst Jacob Sullum wrote,



 “

 Obama's attempt to discredit his opponents by linking them to sinister outsiders reminds us that neither major party has a monopoly on xenophobia. To some extent, crying ""foreigner"" reflects the president's desperation in the face of the Democrats' looming midterm losses.[9]

 ”


Pre-election Forecasts
In recent years, as the chart shows, the incumbent party loses an average of 16 House seats.  The GOP needed 39 seats to win back the House.  
Democrats had to defend about 60 marginal House seats in 2010, as opposed to about 40 for Republicans. At high risk were 27 Democratic seats and just 13 Republican seats that may see a party switch.
Election forecasters in September 2009 were revising their predictions downward for the Democrats, as Obama's popularity continues to plunge. From April to August, Obama lost 10 points across the board—suffering losses in every group except blacks, who remain loyal to him.[10] The popularity of Congress remains low. Starting in January 2010 the number of Americans who identify themselves as Democrats was at a seven-year low.[11] The Republican party, however, suffers from a lack of leaders and its own poor reputation in voter esteem.
""No question, August proved cathartic for voters and chaotic for congressional Democrats. But way before the town hall meetings during recess, there were ample signs for Democrats to fear for their careers in 2010,"" concluded Cook Political Report House analyst David Wasserman, who predicts the Democrats will lose 20 seats in the House, but retain control.[12]  Wasserman concludes that a major shift has been underway among ""angry white seniors"" (over age 60), who strongly dislike the Obama health care proposals because they fear they will lose benefits they now have. 
Analyst Stuart Rothenberg reported that, ""Growing public concern about spending, taxes and the size of government has started to shift the national landscape away from the Democrats to a more neutral position, and quite possibly toward the GOP.""[13] Furthermore, an advantage for Republicans was that 48 House Democrats, 8 more than the size of their majority, come from districts that voted for both George W. Bush and John McCain.[14]
Columnist Rich Galen observed,



 “

 He railroaded his signature legislation - Obamacare - through the Congress costing his party 60+ seats in the 2010 mid-term election and guaranteeing GOP control of the House for the foreseeable future. Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi will go down in history as enablers of the sacrifice of Obama's Congressional allies on the alter of his enormous ego.[15]

Senate
Texas Senator John Cornyn, the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, quietly put Senate Republicans in a position to benefit as the national political environment went negative toward Democrats, and was successful in narrowing the Democratic majority. Without losing any of their seats, the Republican Party defeated two incumbents, Blanche Lincoln (D-Arkansas) and Russ Feingold (D-Wisconsin), and won four Democratic-held open seats: Illinois, Indiana, North Dakota, and Pennsylvania. Additionally, Republican Scott Brown was elected to replace the late Senator Ted Kennedy (D-Massachusetts) in a January special election.  

Republican Gains
Arkansas
Moderate Democrat Blanche Lincoln was defeated by 21 percentage points after Republicans made her one of their top targets in 2010. In the 2008 Presidential Election, Arkansas was one of the few states where John McCain exceeded George W. Bush’s margin, despite the national trend favoring Democrats. Generally, she voted the party line with President Obama, which angered her conservative constituents, but also voted against the Employee Free Choice Act (card check) and opposed to the public option in health care, which angered liberals. She began airing TV ads in March touting her independence from President Obama and national Democrats. Lincoln defeated Lieutenant Governor Bill Halter in a close runoff for the Democratic nomination.
Third district Congressman John Boozman easily won the Republican nomination, defeating State Senator Gilbert Baker and former State Senator Jim Holt. Boozman comfortably led thoughout the entire campaign.

Indiana
Two-term Democrat Evan Bayh dropped out of his reelection in February after polls showed he may be vulnerable after his vote for the economic stimulus package and government-run health care. Former Republican U.S. Senator Dan Coats, who predeced Bayh after retiring in 1998, announced his candidacy for his old Senate seat. Former six-term Congressman John Hostettler, State Senator Marlin Stutzman and businessman Don Bates Jr. were defeated for the Republican nomination. Conservative Congressman Mike Pence considered running, but instead chose to seek reelection in the House.
8th district Congressman Brad Ellsworth was the Democratic nominee. Dan Coats defeated Ellsworth by a 55%-40% margin. Ellsworth supported President Obama’s health care plan in a state where opposition to the legislation is higher than it was nationally.[16]

Illinois
Democratic Senator Roland Burris had been plagued by controversies. Burris was appointed to replace Barack Obama by Governor Rod Blagojevich, who had been arrested on a variety of federal corruption charges (including for trying to ""sell"" Obama's Senate seat). Burris was then accused of committing perjury after he admitted to not testifying truthfully at a committee investigating Governor Blagojevich. Burris announced he would not seek a full term in 2010.
Moderate-GOP Congressman Mark Kirk, representing a Democratic-leaning district that covers suburban Chicago, easily won the Republican nomination, while Illinois State Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias defeated Chicago Inspector General David Hoffman in a close primary. Both candidates faced negative media publicity, Giannoulias for the collapse of his family bank, and Kirk for exaggerating his military record. In the general election, Kirk defeated Giannoulias by a 48%-46% margin.

Massachusetts
Republican State Senator Scott Brown pulled a major upset when he defeated Attorney General Martha Coakley by a 52%-47% margin.
Liberal icon Ted Kennedy, the third longest-serving Senator in U.S. history, died in August 2009, marking the end of an era. During the 2004 Presidential Election the Democratic super-majority in the state legislator blocked the right of Republican Governor Mitt Romney to appoint an interim senator had John Kerry been elected President. After changing the law to allow Governor Deval Patrick, a Democrat, the right to appoint a temporary replacement for Kennedy, he choose former Democratic National Committee chairman Paul Kirk. He did not seek a full term of his own, and a special election was held on January 19, 2010. 
State Attorney General Martha Coakley won the Democratic primary, defeating businessman Alan Khazei, Representative Mike Capuano, and Boston Celtics co-owner Stephen Pagliuca. Charismatic State Senator Scott Brown was the Republican nominee.[17]

 a last minute appeal
It was a safe Democratic seat until January, when Democrats reeled in shock as Coakley lost her 30-point lead and trailed by 5-10 points in the closing hours. Coakley was an ineffective machine-style insider candidate who was unable to reach independents. Brown's main theme was that he would be the 41st senator and would block the Obama health care plan—which Massachusetts did not need, he explained, because it had its own plan in operation. Coakley responded by attacking bankers and bringing in big guns like Bill Clinton, John Kerry and Barack Obama. They appealed to regular Democrats and alienated the equally numerous independents, who preferred Brown by more than 2-1. 
The defeat for Coakley, coming on the heels of the Democrats' loss of Virginia and New Jersey in Nov. 2009, was a major blow to the liberal caused and reinvigorated the Republican party nationally.

North Dakota
Byron Dorgan, a three-term Democrat Senator from North Dakota, announced he would not seek reelection. Dorgan's announcement represented an opportunity for Republicans, after popular Governor John Hoeven announced his candidacy.[18] Hoeven defeated State Senator Tracy Potter by a 76%-22% margin, carrying every county.

Pennsylvania
After polls showed him losing the Republican primary by as much as 20 points, Arlen Specter simply changed party affiliation to Democrat. Despite full support by President Obama and virtually every elected Democrat in Pennsylvania as well as nearly every major newspaper, Specter went on to lose the Democratic nomination to 7th-district Congressman Joe Sestak in the primary, and faced former 15th district Congressman and Club for Growth President Pat Toomey, known for his economic conservatism. In the general election, Toomey defeated Sestak by a 51%-49% margin.

Wisconsin
Three-term incumbent Russ Feingold had positioned himself for a comfortable reelection after former governor and Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson announced he would not run. However, Tea Party activist and Oshkosh businessman Ron Johnson defeated Feingold by a 52%-47% margin.

Democratic Holds
California
Although California is a solidly Democratic state, conservatives originally saw outspoken liberal Senator Barbara Boxer as vulnerable. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was term-limited in 2010, announced he would not run. Former Hewlett-Packard Company President Carly Fiorina defeated former U.S. Rep. Tom Campbell and Assemblyman Chuck DeVore in the Republican primary. Boxer defeated Fiorina by ten percentage points.

Colorado
Appointed Democratic Senator Michael Bennet was narrowly reelected. Former Speaker of the Colorado House of Representatives Andrew Romanoff was defeated in his bid to challenge Bennet for the Democratic nomination, while Weld County District Attorney Ken Buck defeated former Lieutenant Governor Jane Norton in the Republican primary. 

Connecticut
30-year Senate veteran Chris Dodd announced he would not seek a sixth term. Dodd's approval ratings plummeted after his failed presidential campaign in 2008, his controversial mortgage deal from Countrywide, and revelations about the $165 million bonuses for AIG executives that he attached in an amendment to the economic stimulus package, despite receiving federal bailout money. Popular state Attorney General Richard Blumenthal won the Democratic nomination, increasing the Democrats' chances of holding the seat. However, his poll numbers dropped after a New York Times report revealed that he exaggerated his military record.
Republicans nominated World Wrestling Entertainment CEO Linda McMahon, defeating former Congressman Rob Simmons and libertarian-leaning economist Peter Schiff, a stock broker and adviser to Ron Paul’s 2008 presidential campaign. Blumenthal won the general election by a 55%-43% margin.

Delaware
Joe Biden was simultaneously elected to a seventh term in the Senate and Vice President at the same time. Democratic Governor Ruth Ann Minner appointed a ""caretaker"" Senator, Ted Kaufman. Michael Castle, a moderate Republican who also served as Governor and Lieutenant Governor, was heavily favored to win the Republican nomination. However, Tea Party backed insurgent Christine O’Donnell ousted Castle in the primary, improving New Castle County Executive Chris Coons chances in holding the seat for Democrats. The Republican Party had a mixed reaction to O’Donnell's victory. She had caused controversy regarding her views on creationism and Christian values. Coons defeated O’Donnell by a 57%-40% margin.

Maryland
Entrenched incumbent Barbara Mikulski easily won reelection, defeating physician and Queen Anne's County Commissioner Eric Wargotz.

Nevada
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid faced a competitive reelection in 2010. The ""Cook Political Report"" in September 2009 rateed the contest as ""Toss Up."" His status weakened in summer 2009, as discontent with President Obama and the Democrats' health plan mounted, and as the Recession of 2008 continues to batter Las Vegas and the entire Nevada economy, with no relief in sight from the stimulus bill Reid pushed through the Senate. Reid's inability to improve his standing in the polls, coupled with the deteriorating political environment for Democrats nationally, were clear indications that his political problems are deep and will be difficult (though not impossible) to fix, says Cook. 
After receiving the endorsement of the Tea Party Express and Club for Growth, former Assemblywoman Sharron Angle defeated former State Senator Sue Lowden and businessman Danny Tarkanian in the Republican primary. Reid defeated Angle by a 50%-45% margin.

New York
Senior Senator Charles Schumer was considered the safest incumbent of 2010 and won his reelection by a 66%-33% margin against Republican Jay Townsend.

New York-Special Election
Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand was appointed by Governor David Patterson to replace Hillary Clinton after much confusion on his part. Patterson mishandled the proposed appointment of Caroline Kennedy, gaining ridicule for both of them.  Gillibrand's moderate views alienated the left wing of the Democratic Party. Former Tennessee Congressman Harold Ford, Jr. has announced he will not seek a primary challenge to Gillibrand.
Nine-term Congressman Peter King has declined to run. Republicans are tried but failed to recruit former Governor George Pataki, who ran ahead in the polls with Gillibrand. Real estate billionaire Mort Zuckerman, despite having a record of supporting liberal causes, was mentioned as a possible Republican or Independent candidate to avoid a primary, however announced that he would not run. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani declined to seek the Senate seat.[19] Instead, Republicans nominated former Congressman Joseph DioGuardi, whom Gillibrand defeated by a 62%-36% margin.

West Virginia
Popular Democratic Governor Joe Manchin was elected to replace the late Exalted Cyclops Senator Robert Byrd. Businessman and 2006 nominee John Raese made the race surprisingly close by tying Manchin to the Obama administration.

Alaska 
Lisa Murkowski won a term for the U.S. Senate in her own right in 2004 by a close 48%-45% margin, however, in 2010 she lost the Primary Election against Joe Miller, a Conservative candidate and Tea Party favorite. Democrats nominated Sitka, Alaska Mayor Scott McAdams. Murkowski pursued her campaign as a write-in candidate, and was reelected with a 39% plurality, while Miller received 35% and McAdams 23%. She has the distinction of being the first person elected to the Senate via write-in since Strom Thurmond in 1954. 

Arizona
Senior Senator John McCain, the Republicans presidential nominee in 2008, caught a break when Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano was appointed Secretary of Homeland Security.

Florida
Republican Governor Charlie Crist, who once enjoyed high approval ratings, appointed George LeMieux upon the resignation of Senator Mel Martinez. LeMieux held the seat temporarily for Governor Crist who decided to run for the Senate. He was the establishment pick for the Republican nomination, but was challenged by conservative Florida House Speaker and Tea Party backed candidate Marco Rubio, who led by 32 points according to Public Policy Polling.[20] Crist announced he would drop out of the Republican primary and run as an Independent. 
Crist alienated conservatives when he campaigned with President Obama in support for the $787 billion economic stimulus package, which was entirely opposed by the Florida Republican federal delegation. Democrats nominated 17th district Congressman Kendrick Meek, who defeated billionaire businessman Jeff Greene. Rubio was elected with a 49% plurality, defeating Crist who received 30% and Meek who received 20%. 

Georgia
First-term Senator Johnny Isakson's had solid standing for his reelection. His most formidable Democratic opponent, state Attorney General Thurbert Baker, instead sought a campaign for Governor. Isakson defeated Labor Commissioner Mike Thurmond by a 58%-39% margin.

Idaho
Mike Crapo's conservative voting record goes along with the Republican stronghold of Idaho. In 2004, he faced no Democratic challenger and won reelection with over 99% of the vote. Crapo's seat was one of the safest in the 2010 election cycle, and he won reelection by a 71%-25% margin.

Iowa
30-year incumbent Charles Grassley is one of the most distinguished and influential Republican Senators in Washington (he serves as ranking member of the Finance Committee). He was reelected by a 65%-33% margin against former U.S. Attorney Roxanne Conlin, carrying all but one county.

Kansas
Incumbent Republican Sam Brownback honored his campaign pledge to serve only two terms. 1st district Congressman Jerry Moran defeated 4th district Congressman Todd Tiahrt for the Republican nomination by a 50%-45% margin, while Democrats nominated Lisa Johnston, an administrator at Baker University.

Paul campaigned on a reducation in taxion and spending, and won the support of conservatives and libertarians alike. Paul defeated Conway by a 56%-44% margin.

Louisiana
Louisiana, a conservative state, was not effected by the national trend for Democrats in 2006 and 2008. Republican Bobby Jindal was elected Governor by a landslide in 2007, in 2008 John McCain received a larger margin of victory in the state than George W. Bush in 2004, while the GOP gained two House seats from the Democrats. Yet first-term Republican David Vitter was considered to be vulnerable for his reelection after he confessed in 2007 to seeing an escort service, which has tainted his career. Third-district Congressman Charlie Melancon won the Democratic nomination. Vitter defeated Melancon by a 57%-38% margin.

Missouri
Incumbent Republican Senator Kit Bond announced he will not seek fifth term. Former House Majority Whip Roy Blunt announced his candidacy.

Secretary of State Elaine Marshall defeated former State Senator Cal Cunningham and Attorney Ken Lewis in the Democratic primary. Burr was reelected by a 55%-43% margin.

Ohio
Moderate Republican George Voinovich announced he would not seek a third term. Lieutenant Governor Lee Fisher won the Democratic nomination over Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner with 55% of the vote, a much closer margin than polls had shown.[22] Fisher received the endorsement of Democratic Governor Ted Strickland. Meanwhile, Republicans rallied behind Rob Portman, former Congressman and Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Although polls originally showed a tight race, Portman defeated Fisher by a 57%-39% margin.

Oklahoma
Tom Coburn was elected to a second term by a 71%-26% margin against Democrat Jim Rogers.

South Carolina
First-term Republican Jim DeMint, whose reputation as an outspoken conservative, has not hurt him in the Republican stronghold of South Carolina. Democrats nominated an unconventional candidate, Alvin Greene, an unemployed Army veteran who was indicted on criminal charges for showing pornographic pictures to a teenage college student.[23] DeMint defeated Greene by a 61%-28% margin.  

South Dakota
In 2004, John Thune defeated Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, and his victory quickly made him a rising star in the Republican Party. Thune ran unopposed in his reelection.[24]

Utah 
Three-term Senator Robert Bennett represents a state that John McCain won by over thirty-percentage points and was expected to win reelection by a comfortable margin. However, he was defeated in the Republican caucus to Mike Lee and Tim Bridgewater after his vote for TARP. Bennett ruled out a write-in campaign, and Lee went on to win the Republican primary and general election.

Governors
In the 2010 gubernatorial elections, the Democratic Party won five governorships held by retiring Republicans: California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Minnesota, and Vermont. The Republican Party won nine governorships from retiring Democrats: Kansas, Oklahoma, Maine, Michigan, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Wisconsin, Wyoming, and defeated two incumbents, Chet Culver of Iowa and Ted Strickland of Ohio. An Independent was elected Governor of Rhode Island to replace a retiring Republican, and a Republican was elected Governor of Florida to replace an Independent. Thus, Republicans had a net gain of six governorships, and the majority of Governors in the United States flipped from Democrat to Republican. Republicans also won the governorships of New Jersey and Virginia from the Democrats in the 2009 elections.

Democratic Gains
California
Incumbent Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger was prohibited from seeking reelection because of term-limits. Schwarzenegger was elected in 2003 after a recall of Governor Gray Davis and reelected in a landslide in 2006.

State Attorney General and former Governor Jerry Brown won the Democratic nomination. On the Republican side, former Ebay CEO Meg Whitman defeated State Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner.

Minnesota
Two-term Governor Tim Pawlenty announced he would not seek another term, and became a potential 2012 GOP presidential candidate.

Vermont
Although a solidly Democratic state (Barack Obama won it with over 67% of the vote) Republican Jim Douglas was elected governor in 2002 and reelected in 2004, 2006, and 2008. Douglas announced he would not run for another term, and Republicans nominated Lieutenant Governor Brian Dubie. Democratic State Senator Peter Shumlin defeated Dubie by a 50%-48% margin in the general election.

Independent Gains
Rhode Island
Although Democrats have dominated Rhode Island politics, they have voted Republican for 7 of the last 10 gubernatorial elections. As Rhode Island was hit hard by the national recession, Republican Governor Donald Carcieri suffered in the polls, and was barred from seeking a third term because of term-limits. Lincoln Chafee, former Senator who was known as the most liberal Republican in Congress, was elected Governor as an Independent, defeating Republican John Robitaille and Democrat Frank Caprio.

Republican Gains
Florida

Iowa

She defeated Denish by a 54%-46% margin, becoming the first Hispanic woman elected governor in the United States. 

Ohio
Incumbent Democrat Ted Strickland faced sagging approval ratings and tough reelection prospects as Ohio lost jobs and population during his governorship.

Illinois
Democratic Governor Pat Quinn was installed as governor after the impeachment of Rod Blagojevich, and announced he would seek a full term. Quinn narrowly won the Democratic nomination against State Comptroller Dan Hynes.

"""Constitution Lecture One""",https://www.conservapedia.com/%22Constitution_Lecture_One%22,"CONSTITUTION LECTURE ONE.
GETTING STARTED ON A GREAT ADVENTURE!
1. Course Materials
2. How to Read:  Objective meaning?  Or, subjective interpretation? 
3. First Homework Assignment
4. Thinking about Our Constitution

1. Course Materials: You need 4 items: 
	a) Pocket copy of Declaration of Independence and The U.S. Constitution.  www.askheritage.org/  has them. 
	b) The Federalist Papers.  This is a collection of 85 essays written during 1787-1788 by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay, in order to explain the proposed Constitution to The People and to induce them to ratify it.  For this reason, The Federalist Papers are THE authoritative commentary on the meaning of The Constitution.
The late 18th century style of writing might seem difficult at first; but if you stick with it, you will get used to it. The authors were geniuses in political philosophy, and they are delightful!  James Madison, of course, is The Father of the U.S. Constitution.
There are web editions with searchable texts, and Amazon has hard copies. 
	c)  Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language (1828).[Go to www.lexrex.com/catalog/webster1828.htm ] I have the big beautiful green & gold hard copy which is a facsimile of the original. It costs almost $60.00; but is worth it.  Amazon also has it in hard copy and in kindle for $10.00.  
You need Webster's because words change meaning throughout time:  200 years ago, ""nice"" meant ""precise"". ""Choice"" now means ""abortion"".  For the statist-in-chief, words have no objective meaning at all - they are merely devices to create emotional reactions in his mindless followers.  The statists have been hard at work for many years destroying our Language. There IS a political motive for destroying a Language! [See George Orwell's Essay, ""Politics and the English Language"" at www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm ]  To restore Our Constitutional Republic, we must learn what the Words meant when The Constitution was written.    
	d) Colored pencils.

2. How should we read The Declaration of Independence, The Constitution, and The Federalist Papers?  There are two schools of thought:
	a) The Traditional View, which I urge you to embrace, is that texts have a fixed and objective meaning, and it is the reader's task to ascertain that meaning. In order to do this, you must, among other things, pay close attention to definitions of words - you must understand the meaning of words the same way the author understood them.  This is why you need Webster's 1828 Dictionary.
You must also lay aside your own views and everything you think you already know about the subject so that you can read with an open mind, and so you don't read your own views into the text.  Here is a common example of such error:  Our allies are rightly angry at the ""federal"" government in Washington, D.C.   But to some of these allies, ""federal"" has become a  very bad word synonymous with statist government. So, they argue, since Hamilton, Madison, and Jay were ""federalists"", they were big-government statists, and the Anti-federalists were the ones with the right idea!  
But this dreadful error can be avoided simply by opening your mind and by looking up federal in Webster's! There, we learn that federal meant:


Consisting in a compact between parties, particularly and chiefly between states or nations; founded on alliance by contract or mutual agreement; as a federal government, such as that of the United States.


It is the federal government created by The Constitution which is explained and endorsed in The Federalist Papers. The federal government created by Our Constitution bears no resemblance whatsoever to the illegitimate dictatorship now in Washington, D.C.

	b) The modern view on how to understand a literary text is that a text means whatever the reader thinks it means.  The concept of a text having a fixed and objective meaning has been thrown out altogether!  [See article on ""Deconstruction"" at www.yale.edu/lawweb/jbalkin/articles/deconessay.pdf ]
The sorry result of this view is that American educrats no longer teach how to read for the objective meaning of a text.  It has become the dogma of our time that texts have no “objective meaning” to be discovered!  Instead, each person is to come up with his own “understanding” – and one person’s “understanding” is as good as another’s.  A friend recalls the following incident which occurred in an high school English class during 1960:  The class read a short story, and then the teacher asked each student to say what the story meant to him.  Whatever a student said was praised by the teacher.  But when it was my friend’s turn, he said:  “It doesn’t matter what it means to me – what matters is what the author meant.”  The teacher was not pleased with this ‘out of place’ comment.  Is it any wonder that judges on the U.S. Supreme Court feel free to “understand” the Constitution any way they please?  They were conditioned in school to “think” that way; but they did not resist the conditioning.
But here, you will learn how to read our Founding Documents to look for and find the ""original intent"" - the ""objective"" meaning of the Documents.  

3. First homework assignment: 
	a) Take your pocket copy of The Declaration of Independence and The Constitution. Go through both documents carefully and underline all references to God.  Be sure you don't miss the express recognition of the Lordship of Jesus Christ which is contained within The Constitution!
	b) For now, read through only the first Seven Articles of  The Constitution.  We will address the Amendments later. 
With another color, go through The Constitution (through Art. VII) and underline each of the law-making powers delegated by The Constitution to Congress.  Most of the powers delegated to Congress are listed (""enumerated"") at Art. I, Sec. 8; however, other enumerated powers granted to Congress are set forth elsewhere in The Constitution.
Use another color for the powers delegated to The Executive Branch; and a 4th color for the judicial power of the federal courts.
	c) Use a 5th color to underline all powers which are specifically forbidden to the  federal government.
Use a 6th color to underline all powers which are specifically forbidden to The States.

4. Thinking about Our Constitution:  Re-read The Preamble.  With respect to The Constitution:  Who established it and put it into effect?  Who is the ""creator"" and who is the ""creature""?  Who is the ""master"" and who is the ""servant""?

4 References


Advantages
Storage space is conserved
Network communication can be reduced
Disadvantages
In some cases, compression can be potentially harmful.  These include:

Flash memory wear: Flash Drives, Secure Digital (SD) cards, and solid-state drives can wear out more quickly due to the increased read/write operations required[1]
Increased file vulnerability: A single lost of corrupted bit can result in the entire file being destroyed
Increased drive vulnerability: If an entire drive is compressed (an option which Windows makes easy in its modern versions) then this problem can be magnified—a lost bit or two can cause the entire contents of the drive to be destroyed.
Additionally, compressing files (or file systems) requires more work from the computer's processor, so this tends to decrease the operating speed on the computer while it is accessing such files.

Common file extensions
When a file or group of files is compressed, it is stored in an archive file using a specific format, which will be marked as such by a file extension.  Common file extensions include:

1689 Boston revolt,https://www.conservapedia.com/1689_Boston_revolt," Andros a prisoner in Boston
The 1689 Boston revolt was an event that happened in Boston shortly after the 1688 Glorious Revolution.

Background
At the time of the revolt, the people gave vent to their feelings about Edmund Andros by calling him The Tyrant of New England.
But his dominion ended suddenly. The English Revolution of 1688 was at hand. James II was driven from his throne and kingdom, and the entire system of arbitrary rule which that monarch had established fell with a crash and Andros with the rest. The news of the revolution and of the accession of William and Mary reached Boston on the 4th of April, 1689. A few days afterward, the governor had occasion to write a note to his colonel of militia, telling him to keep the soldiers under arms, as there was ""a general buzzing among the people."" On the 18th of the month, the citizens of Charlestown and Boston rose in open rebellion. Andros and his minions, attempting to escape, were seized and marched to prison.[1]

1938 Midterm Elections,https://www.conservapedia.com/1938_Midterm_Elections,"In the midterm elections of 1938 the Republican Party gained 81 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and six seats in the U.S. Senate from the Democratic Party.  
Republicans had lost seats in both houses of Congress in 1930, 1932, 1934, and 1936. Their totals were a mere 88 seats in the House and 16 seats in the Senate. Following President Franklin D. Roosevelt's landslide reelection in 1936, he attempted to pack the Supreme Court with six new justices to neutralize conservative Justices who struck down some of his New Deal programs as unconstitutional. It received backlash from his own party as an overreach of executive power.
Roosevelt's political standing was also damaged by a sharp economic downturn in 1937 and 1938. Unemployment rose from 5 million Americans to more than 12 million, manufacturing, consumer spending, and personal income all declined. Critics dubbed it the ""Roosevelt Recession"" and seemed to vindicate Republican attacks on the New Deal. According to an August 1938 Gallup poll, 66% of Americans wanted FDR to take more conservative policies.[1]
During the election, Roosevelt launched a campaign to ""purge"" conservative Democrats in primaries. With a few exceptions, almost all of his endorsed candidates lost. Republicans made significant gains, and won the governorships of Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan. Although Democrats retained a clear majority in the House and Senate, most of the incumbent Democrats that were defeated were pro-New Deal Democrats.  Conservatives were now the majority in Congress and Republicans were large enough to be an effective opposition. One notable freshman was future Senate Majority Leader Robert Taft of Ohio.
The 76th Congress passed the Hatch Act (restricts the political activities of federal employees) and the Smith Act (cracks down on internal subversion) over Roosevelt's objection.

2012 Eaton Center shooting,https://www.conservapedia.com/2012_Eaton_Center_shooting,"The 2012 Eaton center shooting was a deadly shooting that took place on June 2, 2012 at approximately 6:23 PM at the Eaton Center inToronto. Five people were shot, and the shooting resulted in two fatalities. The first was Ahmed Hassan, aged 24. The next person to die was 22-year-old Nixon Nirmalendran on June 11.

Culprit
The suspect in the shooting is 24 year old Christopher Husbands. Little is known about the suspect other than the fact that he may have been born in Guyana and that he was under house arrest at the time of the shooting, awaiting trial on a sexual assault charge. He has been charged with one count of first degree murder and six counts of attempted murder in connection to the rampage.

Background
Husbands had recently held a job at a city-run after school program working with small children, playing with them, taking part in craft making sessions, helping with homework, et cetera. He was able to hold that job for more than six months before he was fired for failing to submit the criminal record background check. A policy was previously in place that allowed new hires to hold jobs for up to three months without a background check.

Connection to the Aurora, Colorado Batman premiere massacre
24 year old Jessica Ghawi had survived the Eaton Center shooting, but was killed a month later at the massacre in Aurora, Colorado at the premiere of Batman: The Dark Knight Rises. The massacre is otherwise unrelated, as are the two different lunatics responsible.

1100 Charter of Liberties,https://www.conservapedia.com/1100_Charter_of_Liberties,"The 1100 Charter of Liberties was an early recognition of individual liberties written by Henry I of England when he ascended to the throne in 1100.  It was inspired by the agreement of Ethelred the Unready.[1]
The Charter is an important forerunner to the Magna Carta.[2]

Text of the Charter
Henry, king of the English, to Bishop Samson and Urso de Abetot and all his barons and faithful, both French and English, of Worcestershire, greeting.
1. Know that by the mercy of God and the common counsel of the barons of the whole kingdom of England I have been crowned king of said kingdom; and because the kingdom had been oppressed by unjust exactions, I, through fear of God and the love which I have toward you all, in the first place make the holy church of God free, so that I will neither sell nor put to farm, nor on the death of archbishop or bishop or abbot will I take anything from the church's demesne or from its men until the successor shall enter it. And I take away all the bad customs by which the kingdom of England was unjustly oppressed; which bad customs I here set down in part:
2. If any of my barons, earls, or others who hold of me shall have died, his heir shall not buy back his land as he used to do in the time of my brother, but he shall relieve it by a just and lawful relief. Likewise also the men of my barons shall relieve their lands from their lords by a just and lawful relief.
3. And if any of my barons or other men should wish to give his daughter, sister, niece, or kinswoman in marriage, let him speak with me about it; but I will neither take anything from him for this permission nor prevent his giving her unless he should be minded to join her to my enemy. And if, upon the death of a baron or other of my men, a daughter is left as heir, I will give her with her land by the advice of my barons. And if, on the death of her husband, the wife is left and without children, she shall have her dowry and right of marriage, and I will not give her to a husband unless according to her will.
4. But if a wife be left with children, she shall indeed have her dowry and right of marriage so long as she shall keep her body lawfully, and I will not give her unless according to her will. And the guardian of the land and children shall be either the wife or another of the relatives who more justly ought to be. And I command that my barons restrain themselves similarly in dealing with the sons and daughters or wives of their men.
5. The common seigniorage, which has been taken through the cities and counties, but which was not taken in the time of King Edward, I absolutely forbid henceforth. If any one, whether a moneyer or other, be taken with false money, let due justice be done for it.
6. I remit all pleas and all debts which were owing to my brother, except my lawful fixed revenues and except those amounts which had been agreed upon for the inheritances of others or for things which more justly concerned others. And if any one had pledged anything for his own inheritance, I remit it; also all reliefs which had been agreed upon for just inheritances.
7. And if any of my barons or men shall grow feeble, as he shall give or arrange to give his money, I grant that it be so given. But if, prevented by arms or sickness, he shall not have given or arranged to give his money, his wife, children, relatives, or lawful men shall distribute it for the good of his soul as shall seem best to them.
8. If any of my barons or men commit a crime, he shall not bind himself to a payment at the king's mercy as he has been doing in the time of my father or my brother; but he shall make amends according to the extent of the crime as he would have done before the time of my father in the time of my other predecessors. But if he be convicted of treachery or heinous crime, he shall make amends as is just.
9. I forgive all murders committed before the day I was crowned king; and those which shall be committed in the future shall be justly compensated according to the law of King Edward.
10. By the common consent of my barons I have kept in my hands the forests as my father had them.
11. To those knights who render military service for their lands I grant of my own gift that the lands of their demesne ploughs be free from all payments and all labor, so that, having been released from so great a burden, they may equip themselves well with horses and arms and be fully prepared for my service and the defense of my kingdom.
12. I impose a strict peace upon my whole kingdom . and command that it be maintained henceforth.
13. I restore to you the law of King Edward with those amendments introduced into it by my father with the advice of his barons.
14. If any one, since the death of King William my brother, has taken anything belonging to me or to any one else, the whole is to be quickly restored without fine; but if any one keep anything of it, he upon whom it shall be found shall pay me a heavy fine.
Witnesses Maurice bishop of London, and William bishop elect of Winchester, and Gerard bishop of Hereford, and earl Henry, and earl Simon, and Walter Giffard, and Robert de Montfort, and Roger Bigot, and Eudo the steward, and Robert son of Hamo, and Robert Malet. At London when I was crowned. Farewell.

133tspeak,https://www.conservapedia.com/133tspeak,"Leetspeak or |33t5p34k is a form of heavily modified English, meant to be Elite Speak. It is used primarily on the Internet and the main difference with normal English is that it uses various ASCII characters to replace Latin characters, making it a form of substitution cipher, and many variants of it exist across Internet communities. It is most commonly associated with online gaming, communities, and as it was originally meant to be, hacking.[1]
Despite its name, Leetspeak is used almost exclusively in written rather than spoken communication.

Uses
Leetspeak originates from the BBS system on the Internet, The purpose being to mock newcomers (or n00bs [Variant of newbie]), and to evade obscenity filters. Creative misspellings, unflattering ASCII art, and rude words obscured with ASCII are generally considered L33t5p34k with The most common variant is misspellings, and substituting characters for numbers.

Syntax
Leet generally follows the protocols of common English, with the exception of neologisms. Certain grammatical errors may be placed on purpose.

-Xor suffix. Replaces the ""ER"" and ""R"" phonetic devices. IE: Hacker to Haxor
-Age suffix. Adds to the end of an adjective, or a verb in the infinitive form. IE ""to fail"" to ""failage""
-Ness suffix. Add to the end of a adjective, to make a verb.
-D. Replaces the ""ED"" of a past tense verb, with ""D"". Ie: Failed - Faild

Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?

Am I not an apostle? Am I not free?  Have I not seen Jesus Christ, our Lord?  Did I not convert you?




2

If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.

If I am not an apostle in the eyes of others, surely I am to you: for it is my apostleship that brought you to the Lord.




3

Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,

My answer to those who question me is this,




4

Have we not power to eat and to drink?

Have we not power to eat and to drink?




5

Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?

Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as apostles, and as the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?




6

Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?

Or is it only Barnabas and I who have the power to give up working?




7

Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?

Who goes to war at his own expense?  Who plants a vineyard and doesn't eat some of the fruit?  Or who takes care of a flock and doesn't drink some of its milk?




8

Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?

Is it just me, a man, who says this?  Doesn't the Law say the same thing?




9

For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?

It says in the Law of Moses, ""Do not muzzle the mouth of an ox that is threshing the grain.""  Is God so concerned about oxen?




10

Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.

Or does he say that entirely for us?  Yes, this is written for us: That the plower should plow with hope, and the thresher should share in that hope.




11

If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?

If we have planted spiritual things in you, is it a big deal if we harvest your physical things?




12

If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless, we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.

If others can share in this harvest, can't we too?  Still, we haven't exercised this right.  We endure everything so that we don't hinder the good news of Christ.




13

Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the alter are partakers with the alter?

Don't you know that those who take care of the holy things make their living from the things of the temple?  And those who take care of the alter share in what is offered there?




14

Even so, hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.

In the same way, the Lord has ordained that those who preach the good news should make their living from the good news.




15

But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.

But I have never claimed any of these things though it was my right to do so.  And I'm not writing about them so that I can do so now.  I would rather die than be unable to take pride in not exercising my rights.




16

For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!

Even though I preach the good news, it's nothing for me to take pride in.  I do it because I have to.  Woe is me if I don't preach it!




17

For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me.

If I were doing this by choice, I would deserve a reward; but if not by choice, it's because I've been entrusted with the good news.




18

What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.

So then, what is my reward?  It is that when I preach, I can make the good news of Christ freely available, that I don't make undue advantage of the good news.




19

For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.

Even though I'm free of all men, I've made myself a slave to all men, so that I can win more of them over.




20

And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;

To the Jews, I became like a Jew so that I could win over the Jews; to those who observe the Mosaic law, I lived according to the law so that I could win over those who observe.




21

To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.

To those who don't observe the Mosaic law, I lived without it (not that I'm actually not subject to God's law, since I'm bound to the law by Christ) so that I could win over the non-observant.




22

To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.

To the weak, I behaved as if I were weak so that I could win over the weak.  I am all things to all men so that I can by all means save some.




23

And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.

I do all this for the sake of the good news so that I can share in it.




24

Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.

Don't you know that while everyone who runs in a race runs, only one can win the prize?  So run to win it.




25

And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.

And every man who competes for the win disciplines himself in every way.  They do it to win a temporary prize, but we are striving for an everlasting prize.




26

I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:

So I run, but not aimlessly; I fight, but not shadowboxing.




27

But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.

I train my body and keep it under control so that, having preached to others, I don't get disqualified.

And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;

And all of them were baptized to Moses in the cloud and in the sea,




3

And did all eat the same spiritual meat;

They all ate the same spiritual food




4

And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.

They all drank the same spiritual drink.  They drank from that spiritual Rock that followed them; that Rock was Christ.




5

But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.

But God was not happy with many of them; they were scattered in the wilderness.




6

Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.

These things were an example to us, so that we wouldn't desire evil things as they did.




7

Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.

Don't be idol worshippers as some of them were.  As scripture says, ""The people sat down to eat and drink and stood up to fool around.""




8

Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.

Let's not behave sexually immorally, as some of them did, so that 23,000 of them died in one day.




9

Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents.

Let's not test Christ, as some of them did, and were killed by snakes.




10

Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer.

There is no temptation facing you beyond what is common to man, but God is faithful.  He won't let you be tempted beyond what you can handle.  With the temptation, God gives a way to escape it, so that you can successfully face it.




14

Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.

So, my dearly beloved, keep away from idol worship.




15

I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.

I'm speaking to wise men; judge for yourself what I'm saying.




16

The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?

The cup of blessing which we bless, isn't it the sharing of the blood of Christ?  The bread which we break, isn't it the sharing of the body of Christ?




17

For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.

We are many, but one bread and one body, since we all share that one bread.




18

Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the alter?

Look at the people of Israel.  Aren't those who eat the sacrifices sharing in the alter?




19

What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?

What am I saying?  That an idol is anything significant or that which is sacrificed to idols is anything significant?




20

But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.

But I say, the things the gentiles sacrifice are sacrificed to devils, not to God; and I do not want you to be friends with devils.




21

Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils.

You cannot drink from the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons, and you cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of demons.




22

Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?

Are we going to make the Lord jealous? Do we think we're stronger than He?




23

All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.

""All things are lawful for me""...but not all things are beneficial. ""All things are lawful for me""...but not all things build me up.




24

Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth.

No man should seek after his own, but every man should look out for his neighbor.




25

Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake:

Whatever is sold in the public marketplace, go ahead and eat, and don't ask questions, for the sake of conscience.

One of the first applications of ""don't ask; don't tell"" was in this context. See also ch. 8.


26

For the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof.

For ""the earth belongs to the Lord, and the fullness of it also belongs to Him.""




27

If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.

If any unbeliever invites you to dinner, and you would like to attend, then eat whatever they set before you, and ask no question for the sake of conscience.




28

But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof:

But if anyone tell you, ""This food was offered in sacrifice to idols,"" then don't eat it, for the sake of the one who told you, and for the sake of conscience.

The repetition of the ""earth belongs to the Lord"" phrase is an interpolation.


29

Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience?

And when I say ""conscience,"" I am not talking about your conscience, but rather his. Now why is my liberty constrained by another man's conscience?




30

For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?

If I, by grace, am a participant, why am I talked about in a bad way for a thing that I gave thanks for?




31

Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.

So whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do everything for the glory of God.




32

Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:

Make sure that your conscience is clear,to the Jews,  the Greeks, and to the church of God,




33

Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.

for the same reason that I please men in all things, and do not look after my own profit, but the profit of many, so that they might be saved.

1

Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.

So you be followers of me, just as I am a follower of Christ.




2

Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.

Now, brothers, I like to see that you remember me in everything, and are keeping the ordinances, as I gave them to you.




3

But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.

But I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man. (And the head of Christ is God.)




4

Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.

Every man who prays or prophesies, and has his head covered, is dishonoring his head.




5

But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.

But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head. In fact she might as well have her head shaved.




6

For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.

If the woman is not covered, she should have her hair shaved off as well. But if it's embarrassing for a woman to have her hair shaved off, then she should be covered.




7

For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.

For on the one hand, a man shouldn't cover his head, because after all he is the image and glory of God. On the other hand, the woman is the glory of the man.




8

For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.

For the man is not a product of the woman; the woman is the product of the man.




9

Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.

Nor was the man created for the woman; the woman was created for the man.




10

For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.

For this reason the woman should have a symbol of authority on her head, for the sake of God's Messengers.




11

Nevertheless, neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.

Nevertheless, the man does not exist without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.




12

For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of god.

For as the woman comes from the man, the man is also by the woman, and all things are by God.




13

Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?

Judge for yourselves: is it becoming that a woman pray to God with her head uncovered?




14

Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?

Doesn't even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, that's an embarrassment to him?




15

But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.

But if a woman has long hair, that is a glory to her. Her hair is given her as a covering.




16

But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.

But if any man seems to be argumentative about it, we have no such custom as that, and neither do the churches of God.




17

Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.

Now this is one thing I have to tell you that I do not like: you are coming together, not for better, but for worse.




18

For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.

In the first place, when you come together in the church, I hear that there are splits among you, and I can believe some of what I hear.




19

For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.

For there also must be divisive teachings among you, so that the approved things might be made obvious to you.




20

When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.

So when you come together in one place, this is not for eating the Lord's supper.




21

For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.

For in the eating, everyone is grasping after his own supper before other people. Result: one goes hungry, while the other is stuffed to the point of intoxication.




22

What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.

What's going on here? You have houses to eat and drink in, don't you? Or do you disregard the church of God, and embarrass those who don't have very much? What am I supposed to say to you? Do you expect me to praise you for this? Well, I don't!




23

For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:

I received from the Lord what I also handed over to you: the Lord Jesus, in the very night in which He was betrayed, took bread.




24

And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.

When He had given thanks, He broke it, and said, ""Take. Eat. This is My Body, Which is for you. Do this to remember Me.""

The most reliable Greek manuscripts do not have any verb.  The implied verb is ""is.""  The earliest texts should be translated, ""This is my body which is for you.""  The word ""broken"" in the second half of the verse was clearly a corruption of the original.


25

After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.

And in the same way, after supper, He took the cup, and said, ""This cup is the New Testament in My Blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, to remember Me.""




26

For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.

For as often as you eat this bread, and drink this cup, you demonstrate the Lord's death, until He comes back.




27

Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.

So whoever eat this bread, or drinks this cup of the Lord, in an unworthy fashion, will be guilty from the Body and Blood of the Lord.




28

But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.

But let a man examine his own heart, and allow him to eat from that bread, and drink from that cup.




29

For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.

For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy way, eats and drinks a condemnation for himself, because he does not recognize the body for what It is.

The Greek leaves out any reference to the ""body"" in this verse being the body of the Lord.  It could just as well be the body of believers.  Given the context of Paul addressing unity within the church, this is by far the most likely interpretation.  Also, the fact that even the KJV doesn't use the phrase ""body and blood"" (which Paul uses without hesitation when that is what he wishes to talk about) indicates that the ""body"" here may not be the elements of the Lord's Supper but rather the church as a body of believers.  When in doubt, leave the translation ambiguous and avoid as many liberal additions to the text as possible.


30

For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.

This is why many among you are weak and ill, and many are falling asleep.

I.e., dying.


31

For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.

For if we are ready to judge ourselves, we will not be judged.




32

But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.

But when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord, so that we won't be condemned with the world.




33

Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.

So, brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.




34

And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.

And if any man is hungry, he should eat at home, so that you don't come together into condemnation. I will address the rest of my concerns when I come.

And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.

Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,

Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.

Brothers, don't be children in your understanding. In malice you are children, but in understanding, you need to be adults.




21

In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord.

It is written in the Law: ""With men who speak different languages and other dialects, I will speak to this people. And yet for all that, they will not hear Me,"" says the Lord.




22

Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.

So the foreign-language gift exists for a sign, not to believers, but to unbelievers. But prophesying does not serve for unbelievers, but for believers.




23

If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?

Therefore, if the whole church were to come together in one place, and everyone speak in foreign languages, and some unlearned or unbelieving men come in, won't they say that you are all maniacs?




24

But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:

But if everyone prophesies, and an unbeliever comes in, or an unlearned one, he will be convinced by everyone, and judged by everyone.




25

And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.

This is how the secrets of the heart are revealed. And so he will fall down on his face and worship God, and report that God is well and truly within you.




26

How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, everyone of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.

So, brothers, how is it? When you come together, everyone of you will have a psalm, a doctrine, a foreign language, a revelation, an interpretation. Make sure that all things are done for building-up.




27

If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.

If any man speaks in an unknown language, let it be in pairs, or at most groups of three, and one at a time, and let one man interpret.




28

But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.

But if there is no interpreter, let him keep quiet in the church, and let him talk to himself, and to God.




29

Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.

Let the prophets speak in groups of two or three, and let the other one judge.




30

If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.

If anything is revealed to another bystander, let the first one keep quiet.




31

For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.

For you may all prophesy one by one, so that everyone may learn, and all the people be comforted.




32

And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.

And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.




33

For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.

For God is not the Author of confusion; He is the Author of peace, as He is in all churches of the saints.




34

Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law.

Your women should stop talking out loud in the churches. They are not allowed to talk; they are under instruction to obey, as the Law also says.




35

And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.

And if they want to learn anything, they should ask their husbands at home. It is an embarrassment for women to speak in the church.




36

What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?

What? Did the word of God come out from you? Or did it come only to you?




37

If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.

If any man thinks that he is a prophet, or spiritual, then he should be willing to stipulate that the things I am writing to you are the commandments of the Lord.




38

But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.

But if a man is ignorant, let him be ignorant.




39

Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.

So, brothers, have your desire to prophesy, and do not forbid anyone to speak in a foreign language.




40

Let all things be done decently and in order.

Make sure that all things are done decently and according to a proper order.

11

Therefore, whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.

And so, whether it was I or they, we preached it, and you believed it.




12

Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?

Now if Christ has been preached that he rose from the dead, then why are some of you saying that there is no such thing as the resurrection of the dead?




13

14

And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.

15

Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.

For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.

This corruptible form must put on incorruption, and this mortal form must put on immortality.




54

So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.

So when this corruptible form puts on incorruption, and this mortal form puts on immortality, then this saying that is written will be made real: ""Death has been swallowed up in victory!""




55

""O death, where is your sting? O death, where is your conquest?""




56

The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.

The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the Law.




57

But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

But let us thank God, Who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

.50 Action Express,https://www.conservapedia.com/.50_Action_Express,"The .50 Action Express is a large-bore handgun cartridge designed in 1988 by Evan Whildin, primarily for use in Magnum Research's Desert Eagle handgun. It was later used in Magnum Research's Big Frame Revolver, as well as some other weapons by other companies.
Due to the heavy recoil of such a large caliber bullet, smaller cartridges that are still easily lethal are generally preferred for self-defense. Use for such a high caliber usually involves metallic silhouette shooting or handgun hunting. It is also used for self-defense against thick-skinned animals that would not normally be killed by smaller cartridges, like bear. Hunters or people living in areas with animals like bears would need such a gun.

1974 Midterm Elections,https://www.conservapedia.com/1974_Midterm_Elections,"In the midterm elections of 1974, the Democratic Party gained 49 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and four seats in the U.S. Senate from the Republican Party.
The elections came off the heels of the Watergate scandal that had resulted in the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon, and the United States was in a deep recession with high inflation. The House Democratic freshman were dubbed ""watergate babies"", reformist, anti-military liberals who dominated Congress until 1994. The liberal Congress pressed President Gerald Ford on spending, forcing him into a series of vetoes. The elections had a more significant impact on foreign policy. When North Vietnam violated the 1973 cease-fire agreement and invaded the South again in 1975, President Ford asked Congress to provide funds to supply the South before it was overrun. Congress refused, and on April 30, 1975, Saigon fell to communist North Vietnamese troops. 
Future Democratic presidential candidates Jerry Brown was elected Governor of California to replace the retiring Ronald Reagan, and Michael Dukakis was elected Governor of Massachusetts. 
Despite the elections strong Democratic tilt, future Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich nearly defeated Georgia Congressman Jack Flynt, who had never faced a difficult reelection since his election to Congress in 1954. Future U.S. President Bill Clinton ran for the House in Arkansas, but was defeated by the incumbent Republican by a narrow margin.

110th United States Congress,https://www.conservapedia.com/110th_United_States_Congress," The Zogby International Poll reported a ""paltry 11 percent rated Congress positively, beating the previous low of 14 percent in July."" [1]
The Democratic party which gained control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2006 Congressional midterm elections had promised major reforms within the first 100 hours. One reform in particular was lobbying and ethics reform—a key plank in the fall 2006 campaign.  Democrats vowed greater openness in the Congressional Appropriations process, and an end to so-called ""earmarks,"" an appropriation designated to spend specific money on a specific project in a specific members district, sometimes designating a specific private business concern to whom the money is to be spent with. Several Republican members had been caught up in so-called earmark scandals, trading money for influence, and this was widely accredited as a key reason why the GOP lost control of the House after a dozen years.

Achievements
In the first five months of 2007 after the Democratic party took control of Congress, the majority party,

 Reissued a ""blank check"" to the President on the Iraq War, which allegedly was opposed by 70 percent [2] in opinion polls and was vociferously opposed by many Congressional candidates in 2006. The bill included an increase in the minimum wage.
 Successfully renamed six post offices, four courthouses, a national park, and one of the buildings housing the Department of Education in Washington. They also extended the lives of two government commissions, reduced the membership of the Red Cross board of governors from 50 to 20, and authorized construction of 541 feet of road on a flood plain in St. Louis County, Missouri. 
Kept the government going with two temporary spending bills, completed one appropriations bill which was vetoed, redesignated five Eastern European countries (Albania, Macedonia, Croatia, Georgia and Ukraine) for security aid, and passed a bill on penalties for animal fighting that had passed in the Republican Congress last year. 
Voted to kill lobbying reforms that were part of the 2006 Honest Leadership and Open Government Act Democratic candidates made a centerpiece of their campaign message in 2006.[3]
Passed a bill to allow federal funding of stem cell research on lines of stem cells derived from discarded human embryos created for fertility treatments.  The bill caused the first veto of Bush's presidency.
Passed a bipartisan bill expanding the State Children's Health Insurance Program, increasing coverage by 4 million people by 2012.  After a Bush veto, Congress passed a second version which was also vetoed by the President.
Passed the appropriations bill to fund the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education for 2008.  It was vetoed by the President and did not pass an override.
By mid June 2007, Congressional Approval ratings had hit a new low, with only 23% of the American people expressing approval, worse than President George W. Bush had experienced.[4]  The L.A. Times reported Congressional Approval ratings were the lowest in a decade—since the Clinton Impeachment trial.[5]

Earmark reform
A House ethics panel is led by a lawmaker who holds the record for taking the most free travel, while another panel member was implicated in the recent flap over the firing of U.S. attorneys.  The earmark process by which so-called ""pork barrel"" projects are doled out to members by June 2007 saw no major changes.  In fact, rules approved the first day in power in January, the Associated Press reported, where being ignored. Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, instructed members to withhold ""earmark requests"" until September. 
According to the Associated Press, what Obey did ran counter to new rules Democrats promised that would make spending decisions more open. Those rules made it clear that projects earmarked for federal dollars and their sponsors were to be made available to public scrutiny. The rules also require lawmakers requesting such projects to provide a written explanation describing their requests and a letter certifying that they or their spouse would not make any financial gain from them.  The greater transparency was intended to lead to more self-discipline on the part of lawmakers.[6]  Two weeks later, a group called Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW) reported that after a wave of protest from across the political spectrum, Democrats backed down from plans to keep taxpayers in the dark about tens of billions of dollars in congressionally earmarked spending. CAGW President Tom Schatz said  
“Chairman Obey wanted to stay behind closed doors and play ‘God’ with earmarks, but the taxpayers won this battle for transparency and accountability.” [7]
The legislative journal, The Hill, reported Sen. Carl Levin and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton were the two top Senatorial pork barrel  reciepients via the earmark process in 2007.[8]

Tax increases
House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell of Michigan announced a proposal for a new carbon tax that would increase the gasoline tax by 50 cents.  In addition to raising the gasoline tax, Dingell’s new proposal would institute a “double digit” tax on each ton of carbon dioxide emitted.[9]
The Wall Street Journal reported in April House Ways and Means Chairman Charlie Rangel effectively declared the death of Reaganomics in America.  Democrats have come up with an idea to slow the 17 million middle class Americans subject Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT).  Changes in the AMT rate, and the treatment of dividends and capital gains, still leaves the budget at least $600 billion short of paying for the AMT fix. House Democrats have acknowledged that to close this final gap, they will have to consider raising  personal income taxes.
The top AMT rate would increase to 31.5% from 28%. Democratic tax experts also recommend eliminating the lower rate for capital gains and dividends for those subject to the AMT. This would raise the capital gains tax rate to about 31% from its present 15% rate.[10]

2010 Midterm election,https://www.conservapedia.com/2010_Midterm_election," In the 2010 Midterm Elections, the Republican Party gained 63 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and six seats in the U.S. Senate from the Democratic Party. Republicans also gained six governorships, including Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan.  Republicans gained 680 seats in state legislatures, the most in the modern era.[1]
Republicans gained the most House seats since the 1938 Midterm Elections, giving Republicans their biggest House majority, and Democrats their smallest minority, since 1946.  When blue dog Democrats are added to the Republicans on certain issues like gun control or marriage, the Republican majority is even greater than in 1946.
Democratic loses could be attributed to public rejection of the socialistic policies of the Obama administration. The public disapproved of President Obama's economic policies. In the days leading up to the election, a majority of voters supported repealing/replacing The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, sixty-five percent of voters said that the economic stimulus package either hurt the economy or did no good,[2] and fifty-four percent of those voting said they were dissatisfied with the performance of Barack Obama. Given the high level of Democratic success in the 2006 and 2008 elections, they were also put in the position of having to defend a large number of seats.
John Boehner (R-Ohio), become Speaker of the House in the 112th Congress, exchanging places with Nancy Pelosi (D-California). By tradition Pelosi would be expected to resign her leadership position after such a stunning repudiation by the electorate, but as a self-centered liberal she insisted on becoming the next Minority Leader.

2009 elections
In the Nov. 3, 2009, off-year elections, defeat was the fate of Democrats in New York City, New Jersey and Virginia. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent, spent his way to a third term in New York City while Republican Bob McDonnell won in a landslide for governor of Virginia; in New Jersey Republican Christopher Christie ousted the incumbent Democrat Jon Corzine despite his millions and Obama's campaigning.
Conservatives scored a major internal party victory in Oct. 2009 by forcing the Republican candidate Dede Scozzafava out of a House race in New York's 23rd district, for being too liberal. The Conservative Party candidate was defeated by the Democrat, however, opening up recriminations between GOP officials and conservatives on why the district was lost for the first time since 1992. Conservative activists zeroed in on the 2010 race for Florida's open Senate seat, in which the Republican party Senate campaign committee endorsed moderate Gov. Charlie Crist but the more conservative Marco Rubio mounted a successful challenge. ""If I were Charlie Crist in Florida, what's happening in New York 23 would make me extremely nervous,"" GOP strategist Todd Harris said. ""A lot of the establishment Republicans underestimated the grass-roots anger across the country about spending and the expansion of the federal government. The anger is boiling over now, but a lot of the seeds of discontent were planted over the last five to six years.""[3]

Ad campaigns
 Cartoonist Michael Ramirez of Investor's Business Daily captures the tone of the 2010 Midterm elections.
In late 2009 national money was being poured into nine districts, where Democrats who voted for their party's health care reform may be in trouble. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, representing business, has spent at least $1.6 million in November.  Liberals shoot back against the Chamber and 60 Plus Association with ads targeting 12 Democrats and one Republican who supported health reform. Three liberal groups, Americans United for Change and the labor unions AFSCME and SEIU are teaming up for $1.75 million worth of counter-messaging on broadcast and cable TV in the districts of Reps. Berry, Cao, Connolly, Donnelly, Ellsworth, Hill, Hodes, Michaud, Murphy, Perriello, Pomeroy, Snyder and Titus.
In mid-October the Democratic National Committee, echoing charges debunked[4] by the New York Times, insinuated that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce was using ""foreign money"" to fund ads criticizing Democrats. The president said in a Maryland stump speech, ""we learned that one of the largest groups paying for these ads regularly takes in money from foreign corporations. So groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence American elections, and they won't tell you where the money for their ads comes from…. This is a threat to our democracy."" 
The president himself has received $543,219 from Swiss banking giant UBS AG,[5] a foreign banking corporation which was later fined a record $780 million for its part in helping the rich evade U.S. income taxes.[6] Columnist Ruben Navarrette warned the pitfalls of playing the ""foreign card"" is



 “

 both offensive and dangerous. It exploits people's fears of the unknown and appeals to the prejudice that many of us feel toward those who are different. It also fuels ugly nativist instincts that -- once unleashed -- can do real damage....Democrats know this better than anyone ... The birther movement, which suggests that Obama was actually born in Kenya and thus not eligible to serve as a president, is all about playing the foreign card...[7]

 ”


Commentator Charles Krauthammer called the unfounded attacks on the Chamber of Commerce a baseless McCarthyite smear,[8] while columinst Jacob Sullum wrote,



 “

 Obama's attempt to discredit his opponents by linking them to sinister outsiders reminds us that neither major party has a monopoly on xenophobia. To some extent, crying ""foreigner"" reflects the president's desperation in the face of the Democrats' looming midterm losses.[9]

 ”


Pre-election Forecasts
In recent years, as the chart shows, the incumbent party loses an average of 16 House seats.  The GOP needed 39 seats to win back the House.  
Democrats had to defend about 60 marginal House seats in 2010, as opposed to about 40 for Republicans. At high risk were 27 Democratic seats and just 13 Republican seats that may see a party switch.
Election forecasters in September 2009 were revising their predictions downward for the Democrats, as Obama's popularity continues to plunge. From April to August, Obama lost 10 points across the board—suffering losses in every group except blacks, who remain loyal to him.[10] The popularity of Congress remains low. Starting in January 2010 the number of Americans who identify themselves as Democrats was at a seven-year low.[11] The Republican party, however, suffers from a lack of leaders and its own poor reputation in voter esteem.
""No question, August proved cathartic for voters and chaotic for congressional Democrats. But way before the town hall meetings during recess, there were ample signs for Democrats to fear for their careers in 2010,"" concluded Cook Political Report House analyst David Wasserman, who predicts the Democrats will lose 20 seats in the House, but retain control.[12]  Wasserman concludes that a major shift has been underway among ""angry white seniors"" (over age 60), who strongly dislike the Obama health care proposals because they fear they will lose benefits they now have. 
Analyst Stuart Rothenberg reported that, ""Growing public concern about spending, taxes and the size of government has started to shift the national landscape away from the Democrats to a more neutral position, and quite possibly toward the GOP.""[13] Furthermore, an advantage for Republicans was that 48 House Democrats, 8 more than the size of their majority, come from districts that voted for both George W. Bush and John McCain.[14]
Columnist Rich Galen observed,



 “

 He railroaded his signature legislation - Obamacare - through the Congress costing his party 60+ seats in the 2010 mid-term election and guaranteeing GOP control of the House for the foreseeable future. Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi will go down in history as enablers of the sacrifice of Obama's Congressional allies on the alter of his enormous ego.[15]

Additionally, Republican Scott Brown was elected to replace the late Senator Ted Kennedy (D-Massachusetts) in a January special election.  

Republican Gains
Arkansas
Moderate Democrat Blanche Lincoln was defeated by 21 percentage points after Republicans made her one of their top targets in 2010. In the 2008 Presidential Election, Arkansas was one of the few states where John McCain exceeded George W. Bush’s margin, despite the national trend favoring Democrats. Generally, she voted the party line with President Obama, which angered her conservative constituents, but also voted against the Employee Free Choice Act (card check) and opposed to the public option in health care, which angered liberals. She began airing TV ads in March touting her independence from President Obama and national Democrats. Lincoln defeated Lieutenant Governor Bill Halter in a close runoff for the Democratic nomination.
Third district Congressman John Boozman easily won the Republican nomination, defeating State Senator Gilbert Baker and former State Senator Jim Holt. Boozman comfortably led thoughout the entire campaign.

Indiana
Two-term Democrat Evan Bayh dropped out of his reelection in February after polls showed he may be vulnerable after his vote for the economic stimulus package and government-run health care. Former Republican U.S. Senator Dan Coats, who predeced Bayh after retiring in 1998, announced his candidacy for his old Senate seat. Former six-term Congressman John Hostettler, State Senator Marlin Stutzman and businessman Don Bates Jr. were defeated for the Republican nomination. Conservative Congressman Mike Pence considered running, but instead chose to seek reelection in the House.
8th district Congressman Brad Ellsworth was the Democratic nominee. Dan Coats defeated Ellsworth by a 55%-40% margin. Ellsworth supported President Obama’s health care plan in a state where opposition to the legislation is higher than it was nationally.[16]

Illinois
Democratic Senator Roland Burris had been plagued by controversies. Burris was appointed to replace Barack Obama by Governor Rod Blagojevich, who had been arrested on a variety of federal corruption charges (including for trying to ""sell"" Obama's Senate seat). Burris was then accused of committing perjury after he admitted to not testifying truthfully at a committee investigating Governor Blagojevich. Burris announced he would not seek a full term in 2010.
Moderate-GOP Congressman Mark Kirk, representing a Democratic-leaning district that covers suburban Chicago, easily won the Republican nomination, while Illinois State Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias defeated Chicago Inspector General David Hoffman in a close primary. Both candidates faced negative media publicity, Giannoulias for the collapse of his family bank, and Kirk for exaggerating his military record. In the general election, Kirk defeated Giannoulias by a 48%-46% margin.

Massachusetts
Republican State Senator Scott Brown pulled a major upset when he defeated Attorney General Martha Coakley by a 52%-47% margin.
Liberal icon Ted Kennedy, the third longest-serving Senator in U.S. history, died in August 2009, marking the end of an era. During the 2004 Presidential Election the Democratic super-majority in the state legislator blocked the right of Republican Governor Mitt Romney to appoint an interim senator had John Kerry been elected President. After changing the law to allow Governor Deval Patrick, a Democrat, the right to appoint a temporary replacement for Kennedy, he choose former Democratic National Committee chairman Paul Kirk. He did not seek a full term of his own, and a special election was held on January 19, 2010. 
State Attorney General Martha Coakley won the Democratic primary, defeating businessman Alan Khazei, Representative Mike Capuano, and Boston Celtics co-owner Stephen Pagliuca. Charismatic State Senator Scott Brown was the Republican nominee.[17]

 a last minute appeal
It was a safe Democratic seat until January, when Democrats reeled in shock as Coakley lost her 30-point lead and trailed by 5-10 points in the closing hours. Coakley was an ineffective machine-style insider candidate who was unable to reach independents. Brown's main theme was that he would be the 41st senator and would block the Obama health care plan—which Massachusetts did not need, he explained, because it had its own plan in operation. Coakley responded by attacking bankers and bringing in big guns like Bill Clinton, John Kerry and Barack Obama. They appealed to regular Democrats and alienated the equally numerous independents, who preferred Brown by more than 2-1. 
The defeat for Coakley, coming on the heels of the Democrats' loss of Virginia and New Jersey in Nov. 2009, was a major blow to the liberal caused and reinvigorated the Republican party nationally.

North Dakota
Byron Dorgan, a three-term Democrat Senator from North Dakota, announced he would not seek reelection. Dorgan's announcement represented an opportunity for Republicans, after popular Governor John Hoeven announced his candidacy.[18] Hoeven defeated State Senator Tracy Potter by a 76%-22% margin, carrying every county.

Pennsylvania
After polls showed him losing the Republican primary by as much as 20 points, Arlen Specter simply changed party affiliation to Democrat. Despite full support by President Obama and virtually every elected Democrat in Pennsylvania as well as nearly every major newspaper, Specter went on to lose the Democratic nomination to 7th-district Congressman Joe Sestak in the primary, and faced former 15th district Congressman and Club for Growth President Pat Toomey, known for his economic conservatism. In the general election, Toomey defeated Sestak by a 51%-49% margin.

Wisconsin
Three-term incumbent Russ Feingold had positioned himself for a comfortable reelection after former governor and Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson announced he would not run. However, Tea Party activist and Oshkosh businessman Ron Johnson defeated Feingold by a 52%-47% margin.

Democratic Holds
California
Although California is a solidly Democratic state, conservatives originally saw outspoken liberal Senator Barbara Boxer as vulnerable. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was term-limited in 2010, announced he would not run. Former Hewlett-Packard Company President Carly Fiorina defeated former U.S. Rep. Tom Campbell and Assemblyman Chuck DeVore in the Republican primary. Boxer defeated Fiorina by ten percentage points.

Colorado
Appointed Democratic Senator Michael Bennet was narrowly reelected. Former Speaker of the Colorado House of Representatives Andrew Romanoff was defeated in his bid to challenge Bennet for the Democratic nomination, while Weld County District Attorney Ken Buck defeated former Lieutenant Governor Jane Norton in the Republican primary. 

Connecticut
30-year Senate veteran Chris Dodd announced he would not seek a sixth term. Dodd's approval ratings plummeted after his failed presidential campaign in 2008, his controversial mortgage deal from Countrywide, and revelations about the $165 million bonuses for AIG executives that he attached in an amendment to the economic stimulus package, despite receiving federal bailout money. Popular state Attorney General Richard Blumenthal won the Democratic nomination, increasing the Democrats' chances of holding the seat. However, his poll numbers dropped after a New York Times report revealed that he exaggerated his military record.
Republicans nominated World Wrestling Entertainment CEO Linda McMahon, defeating former Congressman Rob Simmons and libertarian-leaning economist Peter Schiff, a stock broker and adviser to Ron Paul’s 2008 presidential campaign. Blumenthal won the general election by a 55%-43% margin.

Delaware
Joe Biden was simultaneously elected to a seventh term in the Senate and Vice President at the same time. Democratic Governor Ruth Ann Minner appointed a ""caretaker"" Senator, Ted Kaufman. Michael Castle, a moderate Republican who also served as Governor and Lieutenant Governor, was heavily favored to win the Republican nomination. However, Tea Party backed insurgent Christine O’Donnell ousted Castle in the primary, improving New Castle County Executive Chris Coons chances in holding the seat for Democrats. The Republican Party had a mixed reaction to O’Donnell's victory. She had caused controversy regarding her views on creationism and Christian values. Coons defeated O’Donnell by a 57%-40% margin.

Hawaii
Democrat Daniel Inouye easily won reelection against Republican Representative Campbell Cavasso.

Maryland
Entrenched incumbent Barbara Mikulski easily won reelection, defeating physician and Queen Anne's County Commissioner Eric Wargotz.

Nevada
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid faced a competitive reelection in 2010. The ""Cook Political Report"" in September 2009 rateed the contest as ""Toss Up."" His status weakened in summer 2009, as discontent with President Obama and the Democrats' health plan mounted, and as the Recession of 2008 continues to batter Las Vegas and the entire Nevada economy, with no relief in sight from the stimulus bill Reid pushed through the Senate. Reid's inability to improve his standing in the polls, coupled with the deteriorating political environment for Democrats nationally, were clear indications that his political problems are deep and will be difficult (though not impossible) to fix, says Cook. 
After receiving the endorsement of the Tea Party Express and Club for Growth, former Assemblywoman Sharron Angle defeated former State Senator Sue Lowden and businessman Danny Tarkanian in the Republican primary. Reid defeated Angle by a 50%-45% margin.

New York
Senior Senator Charles Schumer was considered the safest incumbent of 2010 and won his reelection by a 66%-33% margin against Republican Jay Townsend.

New York-Special Election
Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand was appointed by Governor David Patterson to replace Hillary Clinton after much confusion on his part. Patterson mishandled the proposed appointment of Caroline Kennedy, gaining ridicule for both of them.  Gillibrand's moderate views alienated the left wing of the Democratic Party. Former Tennessee Congressman Harold Ford, Jr. has announced he will not seek a primary challenge to Gillibrand.
Nine-term Congressman Peter King has declined to run. Republicans are tried but failed to recruit former Governor George Pataki, who ran ahead in the polls with Gillibrand. Real estate billionaire Mort Zuckerman, despite having a record of supporting liberal causes, was mentioned as a possible Republican or Independent candidate to avoid a primary, however announced that he would not run. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani declined to seek the Senate seat.[19] Instead, Republicans nominated former Congressman Joseph DioGuardi, whom Gillibrand defeated by a 62%-36% margin.

West Virginia

Alaska 
Lisa Murkowski won a term for the U.S. Senate in her own right in 2004 by a close 48%-45% margin, however, in 2010 she lost the Primary Election against Joe Miller, a Conservative candidate and Tea Party favorite. Democrats nominated Sitka, Alaska Mayor Scott McAdams. Murkowski pursued her campaign as a write-in candidate, and was reelected with a 39% plurality, while Miller received 35% and McAdams 23%. She has the distinction of being the first person elected to the Senate via write-in since Strom Thurmond in 1954. 

Arizona
Senior Senator John McCain, the Republicans presidential nominee in 2008, caught a break when Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano was appointed Secretary of Homeland Security.

Florida
Republican Governor Charlie Crist, who once enjoyed high approval ratings, appointed George LeMieux upon the resignation of Senator Mel Martinez. LeMieux held the seat temporarily for Governor Crist who decided to run for the Senate. He was the establishment pick for the Republican nomination, but was challenged by conservative Florida House Speaker and Tea Party backed candidate Marco Rubio, who led by 32 points according to Public Policy Polling.[20] Crist announced he would drop out of the Republican primary and run as an Independent. 
Crist alienated conservatives when he campaigned with President Obama in support for the $787 billion economic stimulus package, which was entirely opposed by the Florida Republican federal delegation. Democrats nominated 17th district Congressman Kendrick Meek, who defeated billionaire businessman Jeff Greene. Rubio was elected with a 49% plurality, defeating Crist who received 30% and Meek who received 20%. 

Georgia
First-term Senator Johnny Isakson's had solid standing for his reelection. His most formidable Democratic opponent, state Attorney General Thurbert Baker, instead sought a campaign for Governor. Isakson defeated Labor Commissioner Mike Thurmond by a 58%-39% margin.

Idaho
Mike Crapo's conservative voting record goes along with the Republican stronghold of Idaho. In 2004, he faced no Democratic challenger and won reelection with over 99% of the vote. Crapo's seat was one of the safest in the 2010 election cycle, and he won reelection by a 71%-25% margin.

Iowa
30-year incumbent Charles Grassley is one of the most distinguished and influential Republican Senators in Washington (he serves as ranking member of the Finance Committee). He was reelected by a 65%-33% margin against former U.S. Attorney Roxanne Conlin, carrying all but one county.

Louisiana
Louisiana, a conservative state, was not effected by the national trend for Democrats in 2006 and 2008. Republican Bobby Jindal was elected Governor by a landslide in 2007, in 2008 John McCain received a larger margin of victory in the state than George W. Bush in 2004, while the GOP gained two House seats from the Democrats. Yet first-term Republican David Vitter was considered to be vulnerable for his reelection after he confessed in 2007 to seeing an escort service, which has tainted his career. Third-district Congressman Charlie Melancon won the Democratic nomination. Vitter defeated Melancon by a 57%-38% margin.

Missouri
Incumbent Republican Senator Kit Bond announced he will not seek fifth term. Former House Majority Whip Roy Blunt announced his candidacy.

Lieutenant Governor Lee Fisher won the Democratic nomination over Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner with 55% of the vote, a much closer margin than polls had shown.[22] Fisher received the endorsement of Democratic Governor Ted Strickland. Meanwhile, Republicans rallied behind Rob Portman, former Congressman and Director of the Office of Management and Budget.

Oklahoma
Tom Coburn was elected to a second term by a 71%-26% margin against Democrat Jim Rogers.

South Dakota

Utah

An Independent was elected Governor of Rhode Island to replace a retiring Republican, and a Republican was elected Governor of Florida to replace an Independent. Thus, Republicans had a net gain of six governorships, and the majority of Governors in the United States flipped from Democrat to Republican. Republicans also won the governorships of New Jersey and Virginia from the Democrats in the 2009 elections.

Democratic Gains
California
Incumbent Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger was prohibited from seeking reelection because of term-limits.

Democratic State Senator Peter Shumlin defeated Dubie by a 50%-48% margin in the general election.

1 John,https://www.conservapedia.com/1_John,"I John is a book in the New Testament.
The author identifies himself as John, historically considered to be the Apostle John, who also wrote the Gospel of John along with II John, III John and the Book of Revelation.  Liberal theologians disagree, conceding only that all three epistles were likely written by the same person.
The theme of the book is love and fellowship with God.  This is demonstrated in part by one of its more well-known verses, 1:9 (""If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."")
I John also contains one of the more controversial verses (in terms of whether it is in the original or not): 5:7, commonly known as the Comma Johanneum (""For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one."")  The verse is considered to explicitly support the doctrine of the Trinity; it is included in the King James but excluded from some modern versions (other versions include it but with footnotes that it is not found in most original documents).  Modern scholarship has questioned whether it was in the originals or if it was a later addition; adherents of the KJV Only movement often make this a point in claims that modern translations are ""corrupt"".  David Cloud of Way of Life Literature (a KJV Only advocate, though not to the radical extreme in his views) wrote a defense of the Comma at his website.[1]

101st Airborne Division,https://www.conservapedia.com/101st_Airborne_Division," Major General Dwight D. Eisenhower encouraging the men of the 101st Airborne Division
The 101st Airborne Division is a division of the United States Army that provides forcible entry capability through heliborne 'air assault' operations. Capable of inserting a 4,000 soldier combined arms task force, 150-kilometers into enemy terrain in one lift, and possessing 281 helicopters, including three battalions of Apache attack helicopters, this division is the most versatile in the Army. For this reason, the 101st Airborne Division is the division most in demand by combatant commanders.
Based at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, the division is capable of inserting a 4,000 soldier combined arms task force, 150-kilometers into enemy terrain in one lift, and possessing 281 helicopters, including three battalions of Apache attack helicopters, this division is the most versatile in the Army. For this reason, the 101st Airborne Division is the division most in demand by combatant commanders. 
The 101st stands as the Army's and world's only air assault division with unequaled strategic and tactical mobility. The 101st is unique in that it normally conducts operations 150 to 300 kilometers beyond the line of contact or forward-line-of-own-troops, requiring theater- and national-level intelligence support as a matter of course. 
The 101st was formed on August 15, 1942. The 101st played a key role in D-Day landings on June 6, 1944. The night before the invasion they were dropped behind enemy lines. The planes carrying them were under heavy antiaircraft fire and took evasive action. Scattering much of the division all over Normandy. They caused havoc among the German ranks even though they were not formed up into their proper units and companies. After World War II the 101st Airborne Division was deactivated.
In 1956, the 101st was reactivated as a combat division. Lead elements of the division deployed to Vietnam in 1965, and were joined by the rest of the division in 1967. In 1968, the 101st was reorganized as an airmobile division. In 1973, after its return from Vietnam the 101st was designated an air assault division, and is the only air assault division in the U.S. Army.
In 1991, the 101st Airborne fought in the Persian Gulf conflict, conducting air assault operations deep into enemy territory. The 101st sustained no soldiers killed in action during the 100-hour war and captured thousands of enemy prisoners of war. The division served multiple deployments to Afghanistan for Operation Enduring Freedom and Iraq for Operation Iraqi Freedom.

1 Timothy,https://www.conservapedia.com/1_Timothy,"I Timothy is a book in the New Testament.
Along with II Timothy and Titus it is considered one of the Pastoral Epistles (letters written regarding the conduct of church leaders).
The letter itself states that Paul the Apostle is its author, notwithstanding attacks by liberal theologians on its authorship (along with that of the other Pastoral Epistles).
The main theme of the book is church organization and leadership.  Chapter 3 discusses the qualifications for deacons and elders, while Chapter 5 discusses the church's responsibility for the care of widows, respect for elders, and members in general.
I Timothy 2:12 has been the subject of much debate within Christianity: more conservative theologians argue that it absolutely bars women from leadership roles in the church (pastor, deacon, elder) while more liberal ones argue that Paul was only speaking to the male-dominated culture of his day.

2010 midterm election,https://www.conservapedia.com/2010_midterm_election," In the 2010 Midterm Elections, the Republican Party gained 63 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and six seats in the U.S. Senate from the Democratic Party. Republicans also gained six governorships, including Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan.  Republicans gained 680 seats in state legislatures, the most in the modern era.[1]
Republicans gained the most House seats since the 1938 Midterm Elections, giving Republicans their biggest House majority, and Democrats their smallest minority, since 1946.  When blue dog Democrats are added to the Republicans on certain issues like gun control or marriage, the Republican majority is even greater than in 1946.
Democratic loses could be attributed to public rejection of the socialistic policies of the Obama administration. The public disapproved of President Obama's economic policies. In the days leading up to the election, a majority of voters supported repealing/replacing The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, sixty-five percent of voters said that the economic stimulus package either hurt the economy or did no good,[2] and fifty-four percent of those voting said they were dissatisfied with the performance of Barack Obama. Given the high level of Democratic success in the 2006 and 2008 elections, they were also put in the position of having to defend a large number of seats.
John Boehner (R-Ohio), become Speaker of the House in the 112th Congress, exchanging places with Nancy Pelosi (D-California). By tradition Pelosi would be expected to resign her leadership position after such a stunning repudiation by the electorate, but as a self-centered liberal she insisted on becoming the next Minority Leader.

2009 elections
In the Nov. 3, 2009, off-year elections, defeat was the fate of Democrats in New York City, New Jersey and Virginia. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent, spent his way to a third term in New York City while Republican Bob McDonnell won in a landslide for governor of Virginia; in New Jersey Republican Christopher Christie ousted the incumbent Democrat Jon Corzine despite his millions and Obama's campaigning.
Conservatives scored a major internal party victory in Oct. 2009 by forcing the Republican candidate Dede Scozzafava out of a House race in New York's 23rd district, for being too liberal. The Conservative Party candidate was defeated by the Democrat, however, opening up recriminations between GOP officials and conservatives on why the district was lost for the first time since 1992. Conservative activists zeroed in on the 2010 race for Florida's open Senate seat, in which the Republican party Senate campaign committee endorsed moderate Gov. Charlie Crist but the more conservative Marco Rubio mounted a successful challenge. ""If I were Charlie Crist in Florida, what's happening in New York 23 would make me extremely nervous,"" GOP strategist Todd Harris said. ""A lot of the establishment Republicans underestimated the grass-roots anger across the country about spending and the expansion of the federal government. The anger is boiling over now, but a lot of the seeds of discontent were planted over the last five to six years.""[3]

Ad campaigns
 Cartoonist Michael Ramirez of Investor's Business Daily captures the tone of the 2010 Midterm elections.
In late 2009 national money was being poured into nine districts, where Democrats who voted for their party's health care reform may be in trouble. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, representing business, has spent at least $1.6 million in November.  Liberals shoot back against the Chamber and 60 Plus Association with ads targeting 12 Democrats and one Republican who supported health reform. Three liberal groups, Americans United for Change and the labor unions AFSCME and SEIU are teaming up for $1.75 million worth of counter-messaging on broadcast and cable TV in the districts of Reps. Berry, Cao, Connolly, Donnelly, Ellsworth, Hill, Hodes, Michaud, Murphy, Perriello, Pomeroy, Snyder and Titus.
In mid-October the Democratic National Committee, echoing charges debunked[4] by the New York Times, insinuated that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce was using ""foreign money"" to fund ads criticizing Democrats. The president said in a Maryland stump speech, ""we learned that one of the largest groups paying for these ads regularly takes in money from foreign corporations. So groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence American elections, and they won't tell you where the money for their ads comes from…. This is a threat to our democracy."" 
The president himself has received $543,219 from Swiss banking giant UBS AG,[5] a foreign banking corporation which was later fined a record $780 million for its part in helping the rich evade U.S. income taxes.[6] Columnist Ruben Navarrette warned the pitfalls of playing the ""foreign card"" is



 “

 both offensive and dangerous. It exploits people's fears of the unknown and appeals to the prejudice that many of us feel toward those who are different. It also fuels ugly nativist instincts that -- once unleashed -- can do real damage....Democrats know this better than anyone ... The birther movement, which suggests that Obama was actually born in Kenya and thus not eligible to serve as a president, is all about playing the foreign card...[7]

 ”


Commentator Charles Krauthammer called the unfounded attacks on the Chamber of Commerce a baseless McCarthyite smear,[8] while columinst Jacob Sullum wrote,



 “

 Obama's attempt to discredit his opponents by linking them to sinister outsiders reminds us that neither major party has a monopoly on xenophobia. To some extent, crying ""foreigner"" reflects the president's desperation in the face of the Democrats' looming midterm losses.[9]

 ”


Pre-election Forecasts
In recent years, as the chart shows, the incumbent party loses an average of 16 House seats.  The GOP needed 39 seats to win back the House.  
Democrats had to defend about 60 marginal House seats in 2010, as opposed to about 40 for Republicans. At high risk were 27 Democratic seats and just 13 Republican seats that may see a party switch.
Election forecasters in September 2009 were revising their predictions downward for the Democrats, as Obama's popularity continues to plunge. From April to August, Obama lost 10 points across the board—suffering losses in every group except blacks, who remain loyal to him.[10] The popularity of Congress remains low. Starting in January 2010 the number of Americans who identify themselves as Democrats was at a seven-year low.[11] The Republican party, however, suffers from a lack of leaders and its own poor reputation in voter esteem.
""No question, August proved cathartic for voters and chaotic for congressional Democrats. But way before the town hall meetings during recess, there were ample signs for Democrats to fear for their careers in 2010,"" concluded Cook Political Report House analyst David Wasserman, who predicts the Democrats will lose 20 seats in the House, but retain control.[12]  Wasserman concludes that a major shift has been underway among ""angry white seniors"" (over age 60), who strongly dislike the Obama health care proposals because they fear they will lose benefits they now have. 
Analyst Stuart Rothenberg reported that, ""Growing public concern about spending, taxes and the size of government has started to shift the national landscape away from the Democrats to a more neutral position, and quite possibly toward the GOP.""[13] Furthermore, an advantage for Republicans was that 48 House Democrats, 8 more than the size of their majority, come from districts that voted for both George W. Bush and John McCain.[14]
Columnist Rich Galen observed,



 “

 He railroaded his signature legislation - Obamacare - through the Congress costing his party 60+ seats in the 2010 mid-term election and guaranteeing GOP control of the House for the foreseeable future. Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi will go down in history as enablers of the sacrifice of Obama's Congressional allies on the alter of his enormous ego.[15]

Senate
Texas Senator John Cornyn, the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, quietly put Senate Republicans in a position to benefit as the national political environment went negative toward Democrats, and was successful in narrowing the Democratic majority. Without losing any of their seats, the Republican Party defeated two incumbents, Blanche Lincoln (D-Arkansas) and Russ Feingold (D-Wisconsin), and won four Democratic-held open seats: Illinois, Indiana, North Dakota, and Pennsylvania. Additionally, Republican Scott Brown was elected to replace the late Senator Ted Kennedy (D-Massachusetts) in a January special election.  

Republican Gains
Arkansas
Moderate Democrat Blanche Lincoln was defeated by 21 percentage points after Republicans made her one of their top targets in 2010. In the 2008 Presidential Election, Arkansas was one of the few states where John McCain exceeded George W. Bush’s margin, despite the national trend favoring Democrats. Generally, she voted the party line with President Obama, which angered her conservative constituents, but also voted against the Employee Free Choice Act (card check) and opposed to the public option in health care, which angered liberals. She began airing TV ads in March touting her independence from President Obama and national Democrats. Lincoln defeated Lieutenant Governor Bill Halter in a close runoff for the Democratic nomination.
Third district Congressman John Boozman easily won the Republican nomination, defeating State Senator Gilbert Baker and former State Senator Jim Holt. Boozman comfortably led thoughout the entire campaign.

Indiana
Two-term Democrat Evan Bayh dropped out of his reelection in February after polls showed he may be vulnerable after his vote for the economic stimulus package and government-run health care. Former Republican U.S. Senator Dan Coats, who predeced Bayh after retiring in 1998, announced his candidacy for his old Senate seat. Former six-term Congressman John Hostettler, State Senator Marlin Stutzman and businessman Don Bates Jr. were defeated for the Republican nomination. Conservative Congressman Mike Pence considered running, but instead chose to seek reelection in the House.
8th district Congressman Brad Ellsworth was the Democratic nominee. Dan Coats defeated Ellsworth by a 55%-40% margin. Ellsworth supported President Obama’s health care plan in a state where opposition to the legislation is higher than it was nationally.[16]

Illinois
Democratic Senator Roland Burris had been plagued by controversies. Burris was appointed to replace Barack Obama by Governor Rod Blagojevich, who had been arrested on a variety of federal corruption charges (including for trying to ""sell"" Obama's Senate seat). Burris was then accused of committing perjury after he admitted to not testifying truthfully at a committee investigating Governor Blagojevich. Burris announced he would not seek a full term in 2010.
Moderate-GOP Congressman Mark Kirk, representing a Democratic-leaning district that covers suburban Chicago, easily won the Republican nomination, while Illinois State Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias defeated Chicago Inspector General David Hoffman in a close primary. Both candidates faced negative media publicity, Giannoulias for the collapse of his family bank, and Kirk for exaggerating his military record. In the general election, Kirk defeated Giannoulias by a 48%-46% margin.

Massachusetts
Republican State Senator Scott Brown pulled a major upset when he defeated Attorney General Martha Coakley by a 52%-47% margin.
Liberal icon Ted Kennedy, the third longest-serving Senator in U.S. history, died in August 2009, marking the end of an era. During the 2004 Presidential Election the Democratic super-majority in the state legislator blocked the right of Republican Governor Mitt Romney to appoint an interim senator had John Kerry been elected President. After changing the law to allow Governor Deval Patrick, a Democrat, the right to appoint a temporary replacement for Kennedy, he choose former Democratic National Committee chairman Paul Kirk. He did not seek a full term of his own, and a special election was held on January 19, 2010. 
State Attorney General Martha Coakley won the Democratic primary, defeating businessman Alan Khazei, Representative Mike Capuano, and Boston Celtics co-owner Stephen Pagliuca. Charismatic State Senator Scott Brown was the Republican nominee.[17]

 a last minute appeal
It was a safe Democratic seat until January, when Democrats reeled in shock as Coakley lost her 30-point lead and trailed by 5-10 points in the closing hours. Coakley was an ineffective machine-style insider candidate who was unable to reach independents. Brown's main theme was that he would be the 41st senator and would block the Obama health care plan—which Massachusetts did not need, he explained, because it had its own plan in operation. Coakley responded by attacking bankers and bringing in big guns like Bill Clinton, John Kerry and Barack Obama. They appealed to regular Democrats and alienated the equally numerous independents, who preferred Brown by more than 2-1. 
The defeat for Coakley, coming on the heels of the Democrats' loss of Virginia and New Jersey in Nov. 2009, was a major blow to the liberal caused and reinvigorated the Republican party nationally.

North Dakota
Byron Dorgan, a three-term Democrat Senator from North Dakota, announced he would not seek reelection. Dorgan's announcement represented an opportunity for Republicans, after popular Governor John Hoeven announced his candidacy.[18] Hoeven defeated State Senator Tracy Potter by a 76%-22% margin, carrying every county.

Pennsylvania
After polls showed him losing the Republican primary by as much as 20 points, Arlen Specter simply changed party affiliation to Democrat. Despite full support by President Obama and virtually every elected Democrat in Pennsylvania as well as nearly every major newspaper, Specter went on to lose the Democratic nomination to 7th-district Congressman Joe Sestak in the primary, and faced former 15th district Congressman and Club for Growth President Pat Toomey, known for his economic conservatism. In the general election, Toomey defeated Sestak by a 51%-49% margin.

Wisconsin
Three-term incumbent Russ Feingold had positioned himself for a comfortable reelection after former governor and Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson announced he would not run. However, Tea Party activist and Oshkosh businessman Ron Johnson defeated Feingold by a 52%-47% margin.

Democratic Holds
California
Although California is a solidly Democratic state, conservatives originally saw outspoken liberal Senator Barbara Boxer as vulnerable. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was term-limited in 2010, announced he would not run. Former Hewlett-Packard Company President Carly Fiorina defeated former U.S. Rep. Tom Campbell and Assemblyman Chuck DeVore in the Republican primary. Boxer defeated Fiorina by ten percentage points.

Colorado
Appointed Democratic Senator Michael Bennet was narrowly reelected. Former Speaker of the Colorado House of Representatives Andrew Romanoff was defeated in his bid to challenge Bennet for the Democratic nomination, while Weld County District Attorney Ken Buck defeated former Lieutenant Governor Jane Norton in the Republican primary. 

Connecticut
30-year Senate veteran Chris Dodd announced he would not seek a sixth term. Dodd's approval ratings plummeted after his failed presidential campaign in 2008, his controversial mortgage deal from Countrywide, and revelations about the $165 million bonuses for AIG executives that he attached in an amendment to the economic stimulus package, despite receiving federal bailout money. Popular state Attorney General Richard Blumenthal won the Democratic nomination, increasing the Democrats' chances of holding the seat. However, his poll numbers dropped after a New York Times report revealed that he exaggerated his military record.
Republicans nominated World Wrestling Entertainment CEO Linda McMahon, defeating former Congressman Rob Simmons and libertarian-leaning economist Peter Schiff, a stock broker and adviser to Ron Paul’s 2008 presidential campaign. Blumenthal won the general election by a 55%-43% margin.

Delaware
Joe Biden was simultaneously elected to a seventh term in the Senate and Vice President at the same time. Democratic Governor Ruth Ann Minner appointed a ""caretaker"" Senator, Ted Kaufman. Michael Castle, a moderate Republican who also served as Governor and Lieutenant Governor, was heavily favored to win the Republican nomination. However, Tea Party backed insurgent Christine O’Donnell ousted Castle in the primary, improving New Castle County Executive Chris Coons chances in holding the seat for Democrats. The Republican Party had a mixed reaction to O’Donnell's victory. She had caused controversy regarding her views on creationism and Christian values. Coons defeated O’Donnell by a 57%-40% margin.

Hawaii
Democrat Daniel Inouye easily won reelection against Republican Representative Campbell Cavasso.

Maryland
Entrenched incumbent Barbara Mikulski easily won reelection, defeating physician and Queen Anne's County Commissioner Eric Wargotz.

Nevada
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid faced a competitive reelection in 2010. The ""Cook Political Report"" in September 2009 rateed the contest as ""Toss Up."" His status weakened in summer 2009, as discontent with President Obama and the Democrats' health plan mounted, and as the Recession of 2008 continues to batter Las Vegas and the entire Nevada economy, with no relief in sight from the stimulus bill Reid pushed through the Senate. Reid's inability to improve his standing in the polls, coupled with the deteriorating political environment for Democrats nationally, were clear indications that his political problems are deep and will be difficult (though not impossible) to fix, says Cook. 
After receiving the endorsement of the Tea Party Express and Club for Growth, former Assemblywoman Sharron Angle defeated former State Senator Sue Lowden and businessman Danny Tarkanian in the Republican primary. Reid defeated Angle by a 50%-45% margin.

New York
Senior Senator Charles Schumer was considered the safest incumbent of 2010 and won his reelection by a 66%-33% margin against Republican Jay Townsend.

New York-Special Election
Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand was appointed by Governor David Patterson to replace Hillary Clinton after much confusion on his part. Patterson mishandled the proposed appointment of Caroline Kennedy, gaining ridicule for both of them.  Gillibrand's moderate views alienated the left wing of the Democratic Party. Former Tennessee Congressman Harold Ford, Jr. has announced he will not seek a primary challenge to Gillibrand.
Nine-term Congressman Peter King has declined to run. Republicans are tried but failed to recruit former Governor George Pataki, who ran ahead in the polls with Gillibrand. Real estate billionaire Mort Zuckerman, despite having a record of supporting liberal causes, was mentioned as a possible Republican or Independent candidate to avoid a primary, however announced that he would not run. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani declined to seek the Senate seat.[19] Instead, Republicans nominated former Congressman Joseph DioGuardi, whom Gillibrand defeated by a 62%-36% margin.

Oregon
Democratic Senator Ron Wyden defeated his Republican challenger, Lewis & Clark College law professor Jim Huffman by a 57%-39% margin. 

Vermont
Patrick Leahy, the third most senior U.S. Senator, was reelected by a 64%-40% margin against Republican Len Britton.

Washington

West Virginia
Popular Democratic Governor Joe Manchin was elected to replace the late Exalted Cyclops Senator Robert Byrd. Businessman and 2006 nominee John Raese made the race surprisingly close by tying Manchin to the Obama administration.

Alaska 
Lisa Murkowski won a term for the U.S. Senate in her own right in 2004 by a close 48%-45% margin, however, in 2010 she lost the Primary Election against Joe Miller, a Conservative candidate and Tea Party favorite. Democrats nominated Sitka, Alaska Mayor Scott McAdams. Murkowski pursued her campaign as a write-in candidate, and was reelected with a 39% plurality, while Miller received 35% and McAdams 23%. She has the distinction of being the first person elected to the Senate via write-in since Strom Thurmond in 1954. 

Arizona
Senior Senator John McCain, the Republicans presidential nominee in 2008, caught a break when Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano was appointed Secretary of Homeland Security. However, former Congressman J. D. Hayworth challenged McCain in a primary, but was defeated by a 56%-32% margin. McCain went on to defeat Tucson City Councilor Rodney Glassman by a 59%-35% margin. 

Florida
Republican Governor Charlie Crist, who once enjoyed high approval ratings, appointed George LeMieux upon the resignation of Senator Mel Martinez. LeMieux held the seat temporarily for Governor Crist who decided to run for the Senate. He was the establishment pick for the Republican nomination, but was challenged by conservative Florida House Speaker and Tea Party backed candidate Marco Rubio, who led by 32 points according to Public Policy Polling.[20] Crist announced he would drop out of the Republican primary and run as an Independent. 
Crist alienated conservatives when he campaigned with President Obama in support for the $787 billion economic stimulus package, which was entirely opposed by the Florida Republican federal delegation. Democrats nominated 17th district Congressman Kendrick Meek, who defeated billionaire businessman Jeff Greene. Rubio was elected with a 49% plurality, defeating Crist who received 30% and Meek who received 20%. 

Georgia
First-term Senator Johnny Isakson's had solid standing for his reelection. His most formidable Democratic opponent, state Attorney General Thurbert Baker, instead sought a campaign for Governor. Isakson defeated Labor Commissioner Mike Thurmond by a 58%-39% margin.

Idaho
Mike Crapo's conservative voting record goes along with the Republican stronghold of Idaho. In 2004, he faced no Democratic challenger and won reelection with over 99% of the vote. Crapo's seat was one of the safest in the 2010 election cycle, and he won reelection by a 71%-25% margin.

Iowa
30-year incumbent Charles Grassley is one of the most distinguished and influential Republican Senators in Washington (he serves as ranking member of the Finance Committee). He was reelected by a 65%-33% margin against former U.S. Attorney Roxanne Conlin, carrying all but one county.

Kansas
Incumbent Republican Sam Brownback honored his campaign pledge to serve only two terms. 1st district Congressman Jerry Moran defeated 4th district Congressman Todd Tiahrt for the Republican nomination by a 50%-45% margin, while Democrats nominated Lisa Johnston, an administrator at Baker University.

Paul received the endorsment of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin.[21] On the Democratic side, Lieutenant Governor Daniel Mongiardo (who lost to Bunning in 2004) was defeated by Attorney General Jack Conway. Paul campaigned on a reducation in taxion and spending, and won the support of conservatives and libertarians alike. Paul defeated Conway by a 56%-44% margin.

Louisiana
Louisiana, a conservative state, was not effected by the national trend for Democrats in 2006 and 2008. Republican Bobby Jindal was elected Governor by a landslide in 2007, in 2008 John McCain received a larger margin of victory in the state than George W. Bush in 2004, while the GOP gained two House seats from the Democrats. Yet first-term Republican David Vitter was considered to be vulnerable for his reelection after he confessed in 2007 to seeing an escort service, which has tainted his career. Third-district Congressman Charlie Melancon won the Democratic nomination. Vitter defeated Melancon by a 57%-38% margin.

Missouri
Incumbent Republican Senator Kit Bond announced he will not seek fifth term. Former House Majority Whip Roy Blunt announced his candidacy.

BLunt defeated Carnahan by a 54%-41% margin.

New Hampshire
Senior Republican Senator Judd Gregg, after withdrawing from a position in the Obama administration, announced he will not seek a fourth term. 2nd district Congressman Paul Hodes won the Democratic nomination, while Republicans nominated former New Hampshire Attorney General Kelly Ayotte. Ayotte defeated Hodes by a 60%-37% margin.

North Carolina
First-term Republican Richard Burr was considered vulnerable after Barack Obama won North Carolina's 15 electoral votes by a narrow margin, and Democrat Kay Hagan defeated Republican Senator Elizabeth Dole. It is also worth noting that no Senator has held this seat for more than one term since 1974. Secretary of State Elaine Marshall defeated former State Senator Cal Cunningham and Attorney Ken Lewis in the Democratic primary. Burr was reelected by a 55%-43% margin.

Ohio
Moderate Republican George Voinovich announced he would not seek a third term. Lieutenant Governor Lee Fisher won the Democratic nomination over Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner with 55% of the vote, a much closer margin than polls had shown.[22] Fisher received the endorsement of Democratic Governor Ted Strickland. Meanwhile, Republicans rallied behind Rob Portman, former Congressman and Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Although polls originally showed a tight race, Portman defeated Fisher by a 57%-39% margin.

Oklahoma
Tom Coburn was elected to a second term by a 71%-26% margin against Democrat Jim Rogers.

South Carolina
First-term Republican Jim DeMint, whose reputation as an outspoken conservative, has not hurt him in the Republican stronghold of South Carolina. Democrats nominated an unconventional candidate, Alvin Greene, an unemployed Army veteran who was indicted on criminal charges for showing pornographic pictures to a teenage college student.[23] DeMint defeated Greene by a 61%-28% margin.  

South Dakota
In 2004, John Thune defeated Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, and his victory quickly made him a rising star in the Republican Party. Thune ran unopposed in his reelection.[24]

Utah 
Three-term Senator Robert Bennett represents a state that John McCain won by over thirty-percentage points and was expected to win reelection by a comfortable margin. However, he was defeated in the Republican caucus to Mike Lee and Tim Bridgewater after his vote for TARP. Bennett ruled out a write-in campaign, and Lee went on to win the Republican primary and general election.

Governors
In the 2010 gubernatorial elections, the Democratic Party won five governorships held by retiring Republicans: California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Minnesota, and Vermont. The Republican Party won nine governorships from retiring Democrats: Kansas, Oklahoma, Maine, Michigan, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Wisconsin, Wyoming, and defeated two incumbents, Chet Culver of Iowa and Ted Strickland of Ohio. An Independent was elected Governor of Rhode Island to replace a retiring Republican, and a Republican was elected Governor of Florida to replace an Independent. Thus, Republicans had a net gain of six governorships, and the majority of Governors in the United States flipped from Democrat to Republican. Republicans also won the governorships of New Jersey and Virginia from the Democrats in the 2009 elections.

Democratic Gains
California
Incumbent Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger was prohibited from seeking reelection because of term-limits. Schwarzenegger was elected in 2003 after a recall of Governor Gray Davis and reelected in a landslide in 2006. However, Schwarzenegger's popularity, along with the Democratic assembly, fell because of the California budget crisis. State Attorney General and former Governor Jerry Brown won the Democratic nomination. On the Republican side, former Ebay CEO Meg Whitman defeated State Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner.

Minnesota
Two-term Governor Tim Pawlenty announced he would not seek another term, and became a potential 2012 GOP presidential candidate.

After a recount, Dayton was confirmed to have won by a 0.5% margin.  

Vermont
Although a solidly Democratic state (Barack Obama won it with over 67% of the vote) Republican Jim Douglas was elected governor in 2002 and reelected in 2004, 2006, and 2008. Douglas announced he would not run for another term, and Republicans nominated Lieutenant Governor Brian Dubie. Democratic State Senator Peter Shumlin defeated Dubie by a 50%-48% margin in the general election.

Independent Gains
Rhode Island
Although Democrats have dominated Rhode Island politics, they have voted Republican for 7 of the last 10 gubernatorial elections. As Rhode Island was hit hard by the national recession, Republican Governor Donald Carcieri suffered in the polls, and was barred from seeking a third term because of term-limits. Lincoln Chafee, former Senator who was known as the most liberal Republican in Congress, was elected Governor as an Independent, defeating Republican John Robitaille and Democrat Frank Caprio. After President Obama refused to endorse Caprio, he caused controversy by telling Obama to take his endorsement and ""shove it."" [27]

Republican Gains
Florida
Republican turned Independent Governor Charlie Crist announced he would not seek a second term and instead run for the United States Senate, resulting in an open race. State Attorney General Bill McCollum was heavily favored to win the Republican nomination, but was defeated by Rick Scott, a millionaire health care executive and activist against federal health care legislation. Democrats nominated Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink, who led Scott in most of the polls following the primary. Scott's campaign emphasized conservative policies such as expanding school choice, abolishing the corporate income tax, and firing state employees.[28] He won the general election by a narrow 49%-48% margin. 

Iowa
Chet Culver, who was elected governor in 2006 riding on a Democratic wave, was defeated in a competitive reelection.

Former Governor Terry Branstad defeated Culver by a 53%-43% margin.

Kansas
Kathleen Sebelius, a Democratic Governor from the Republican-stronghold of Kansas, stepped down after being nominated to serve as Secretary of Health and Human Services in the Obama administration.

Senator Sam Brownback was the Republican nominee, and defeated Democratic state Senator Tom Holland by a 63%-32% margin.

Maine
Democrat Governor John Baldacci was term-limited by state law, and Republicans saw it as an opportunity to gain the governorship. Republicans nominated Waterville, Maine Mayor Paul LePage, who defeated Independent candidate Eliot Cutler and Democratic state Senate President Libby Mitchell with a 38% plurarly. 

Michigan
Democratic Governor Jennifer Granholm suffered in her job approval ratings as the Michigan economy, heavily dependent of the auto industry, continued to falter throughout the 2000s.

Rick Snyder, easily defeated Democrat Lansing Mayor Virgil Bernero by a 58%-40% margin in the general election.

New Mexico
Democratic Governor Bill Richardson was nominated by President Obama to serve as Secretary of Commerce, however was forced to resign after it was exposed that his administration had a ""pay-to-play"" deal with a defense contractor.

The Republican nomination went to District Attorney Susana Martinez, and narrowly led in the polls throughout the campaign. She defeated Denish by a 54%-46% margin, becoming the first Hispanic woman elected governor in the United States. 

Ohio
Incumbent Democrat Ted Strickland faced sagging approval ratings and tough reelection prospects as Ohio lost jobs and population during his governorship. His Republican opponent, John Kasich – a former Congressman and Chairman of the House Budget Committee in the 1990s – campaigned on phasing out the state income tax, leasing the state's toll roads, cutting 15-20 percent of the state's higher education funds, and relaxing sentences on nonviolent offenders to cut down prison costs.[30] He defeated Strickland by a 49%-47% margin.

Colorado 
Despite Democratic success in Colorado during the 2006 and 2008 elections, incumbent Governor Bill Ritter announced his retirement after the prospects of a difficult reelection. His policies of higher taxes and unionization of state employees earned him criticism from the business community, and his approval ratings fell to 45%.[31] Former Congressman Scott McInnis was favored to win the Republican nomination, however fell in the polls after a controversy regarding plagiarizing an article, and was defeated by businessman and political newcomer Dan Maes, who also received criticism for misrepresenting his law enforcement background in the 1980s. Meanwhile, former Congressman Tom Tancredo entered the race in the American Constitution Party, and surged towards the end of the campaign. The turmoil made is easier for Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper to hold the Governors office for the Democrats, and was elected 50% of the vote, to Tancredo's 37% and Maes 11%.

Illinois
Democratic Governor Pat Quinn was installed as governor after the impeachment of Rod Blagojevich, and announced he would seek a full term. Quinn narrowly won the Democratic nomination against State Comptroller Dan Hynes.

In the general election, Quinn pulled somewhat of an upset, winning reelection by a 47%-46% margin.  

Maryland

Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani declined to seek the governorship and endorsed former Congressman Rick Lazio. 
President Barack Obama in Sept. 2009 contacted Paterson, asking him not to seek reelection in 2010 in that he cannot recover from his dismal political standing.

Alaska
Sarah Palin, one-term Governor and former Vice-Presidential nominee, resigned on July 3, 2009 and Lieutenant Governor Sean Parnell inherited the governorship.

Arizona 
After Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano was nominated by President Obama to serve as Secretary of Homeland Security, Arizona Secretary of State Janice K. Brewer, a Republican, succeeded her.

However, her popularity rose after signing a controversial illegal immigration law, and was reelected against state Attorney General Terry Goddard by a 55%-42% margin.

Georgia
In 2002, Sonny Perdue became the first Republican elected Governor of Georgia since reconstruction, and was reelected in 2006. However, he was term-limited in 2010.

1978 Midterm Elections,https://www.conservapedia.com/1978_Midterm_Elections,"In the midterm elections of 1978, the Republican Party gained 15 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and three seats in the U.S. Senate from the Democratic Party. Democrats retained a clear majority in both chambers.
The country was going through a recession, high energy prices and inflation, which hurt President Jimmy Carter's standing in the polls. Although Republican gains were modest by historical standards, the election was significant and indicated the nation was heading towads a more conservative direction. Five prominent liberal Democratic Senators were defeated for reelection, and ten new Senators and 77 House freshman from across party lines were considered more conservative than their predecessors. Republicans also gained six governorships, including Texas and Pennsylvania. Twelve out of sixteen state ballot initiatives to limit taxing and spending passed. 
Future Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich was elected to Congress in Georgia and future Democratic President Bill Clinton was elected Governor of Arkansas. Future Republican President George W. Bush ran for Congress in Texas, but was defeated by a narrow margin.

1979 Grand Mosque Seizure,https://www.conservapedia.com/1979_Grand_Mosque_Seizure,"The Grand Mosque in Mecca (home of the Kaaba) was briefly taken over for a period of weeks by an obscure group led by a poorly educated Bedouin named Juhayman[1] whose theology was an early manifestation of modern violent Salafism. These believers did not embrace many aspects of modern society. They opposed identity cards and passports because these denote loyalty to an entity other than Allah. They were against images of living beings, not only on television and in photography but also on coins. The only previous violent encounter was when a group of young activists were caught smashing shop display windows showing female mannequins in the center of Medina in 1965. And they had peculiar views on ritual practices setting them apart from other religious communities and the religious establishment.
The incident revealed the Saudi state was thoroughly unprepared to deal with a challenge to its legitimacy from conservative religious believers.[2] After three days of fruitless negotiations, the Saudi's turned to external, non-Islamic ""crusader"" forces to dislodge the jihadis. Non-Muslims are not allowed within the city of Mecca, and bloodshed on the grounds of the temple is considered virtually an unpardonable sin; yet the Saudi state and its reigning religious establishment deputized, through a fatwa, the French Special Operations Forces to retake the mosque.[3][4]
Official reports say that 255 fanatics, troops and pilgrims were killed, while 560 were injured. The rebels who survived were imprisoned or beheaded, with reports claiming 63 beheadings.
The respected imam Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani, who abhorred violence, condemned Juhayman's attack; however one of his students, Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi, fell under the influence of Juhayman's thought. In coming years Maqdisi further developed the idea that the ruling Saudi clan were apostate Muslim infidels along with a rejection of the very idea of a nation state.[5]

Differences between 2008 and other elections
In 2008, CNN-YouTube held the first debate in which the questions asked of the nominees in each party came primarily from YouTube viewer submitted videos. The debates received high ratings, however, CNN was criticized for not picking questions that were 'tough' or pertinent enough. One such example was during the Democratic Debate, when CNN chose to ask a question from a snow man, talking about global warming. During the Republican debate, some claimed that many of the questions were from Democratic supporters just meant to embarrass the Republican candidates. For example, a question over whether or not homosexuals should serve in the U.S. military was asked by retired general and gay activist Keith Kerr, an adviser to Hillary Clinton's campaign. 
The internet has also played a major role in the election, with then-Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul and Democratic candidate Barack Obama being very active on the internet.

Young voters
In 2004, 64% of voters aged 18–29 were registered to vote.  This year 75% of voters in that age group are registered.  This demographic usually favors Democrats.

Fewer Uncommitted
Fewer people were undecided this election than in most previous elections.  As of the beginning of October, 2008 approximately 6-8% of poll respondents were undecided, an amount that continued to decline as the election drew closer.

Election Day
The turnout was about normal, except for higher than usual rates among blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and voters under 30—all Obama groups.  The turnout of evangelicals and whites was similar to 2004. There have been allegations of Democrats driving voters around to different voting stations, and as these are Obama groups, this would strengthen the voter turnout of this demographic.

McCain vs. Obama
McCain had the early edge, wrapping up the Republican nomination before Obama was known to be the choice of the Democrats, but this was one of the few advantages he has had.  Both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama raised far more money than McCain, and the Democratic primary saw a surge of new voters coming out leading to a large increase in the rolls of Democrats.  From the historical position of a generally equal number of Republicans and Democrats, the numbers have now tilted 41% Democrat to only 32% Republican.  From the time that Obama was declared the nominee, opinion polling showed him with a modest advantage over McCain in terms of who the voters would choose to be their next President.
Obama's strategy was to tie McCain to George Bush, a very unpopular President, even though McCain was not a part of the Bush administration and often clashed with Bush during his time as senator.  McCain, for his part, had to walk a fine line with accepting praise from the President to woo conservatives, while at the same time keeping enough distance so as to not alienate moderates.  When possible, McCain went after Obama's lack of foreign policy experience.
The trends heavily favored the Democrats, especially after their major gains in 2006.  Overall, Democrat candidates have a +10% advantage over Republicans in a 'generic' election - the current unpopular President is a Republican, and the economy is treading water.  Also, based on statistical percentages of articles on each candidate, Obama was being focused on by the press far more than McCain.  When McCain chastised Obama for his lack of foreign policy experience and that he hadn't been to Iraq or Afghanistan in years, Obama's campaign set up for him to take a trip to both countries.  While this is expected in politics, the decision of every major network to send a team of reporters to follow him was unprecedented.  Obama spoke to 200,000 people in Berlin in a highly covered speech.  McCain spoke to 50,000 in Buffalo shortly thereafter and barely got a whisper.  Obama's numbers started to rise, but a good deal of the populace was noticing the disparity as 48% of those polled felt the press was trying to help Obama win.
Obama seemed pleased to coast on his advantages, but McCain realized he needed to shake things up.  He scored by pushing offshore drilling for oil during a time when oil prices were climbing almost daily.  Obama rejected the idea, but the poll numbers started to show a greater percentage of Americans warming to the concept[2] and McCain's numbers started to improve.  Obama announced he would accept some measure of offshore drilling, and McCain's momentum was halted and his gains retreated by a couple of points.  McCain started an ad campaign that acknowledged Obama's celebrity status, but asking what it meant.  A few days later at the start of August he called out Obama for 'playing the race card' when Obama made a reference to McCain and Bush trying to scare people because he (Obama) doesn't look like other Presidents on dollar bills.  The Democrats fired back, but quickly let the issue drop when poll numbers showed that most voters did consider Obama's statement to be racist.[3]  The bounce for Obama after the Berlin speech shrank back to pre-trip levels.  While Obama continued to enjoy a slight lead in the polls, McCain continued to keep the race close without either candidate breaking away. 
In mid-August, both candidates came together at the invitation of Pastor Rick Warren where each was asked a series of the same questions dealing both with political and personal views.  While not a debate, it was the first televised forum where both candidates had a chance to express themselves and their positions.  Obama hoped to appeal to Christian conservatives by expressing a religious side while McCain hoped to solidify the conservative base by sharing his own conservative and religious credentials.  The difference in style between the two was evident as Obama spent more time explaining and expounding on his positions while McCain was more straightforward and received more laughs with his candid speaking style.  The polling numbers continued as they had been.
There was a bounce at the start of the Democratic convention, but not what was expected as McCain suddenly drew even in the race.  The friction between Hillary Clinton and Obama as well as the perceived slight of Hillary when Biden was chosen as the Vice Presidential candidate hurt Obama at a time when his approval was expected to climb.  McCain then made a mistake by airing an ad of Hillary Clinton that 'supported' him.  Clinton was set to speak at the convention and it was no secret that there was bad blood between her and Obama and it was widely believed that her support for Obama would be lukewarm at best.  Instead, apparently galvanized by McCain's hubris before her speech, she came out strongly for Obama and rallied those who supported her.  Obama's pre-convention edge returned.  Obama followed it up with a very strong speech the next day in a huge stadium with fireworks and a Greek temple.  Dick Morris, a former Bill Clinton political strategist who gave advice to the Republicans in 2008, felt that Obama had done such a good job reaching out to the groups that he needed that he would pull ahead by double-digits.  In order to suppress the bounce from the convention, McCain announced his Vice Presidential candidate the next day, a woman, Alaskan governor Sarah Palin.  The bounce for Obama was muted at first, but increased in the following days to surpass pre-convention levels, especially as Sarah Palin came under heavy attack in the media.
The edge continued as the Republican convention began.  Losing a day to the hurricane, their shortened convention came out strong as well, emphasizing John McCain as a patriot and a maverick for change who is tested and will do what is right for the country regardless of political affiliation.  It was notable for the secondary role that the sitting President played, talking only briefly and barely being mentioned after that.  The convention tied McCain to Ronald Reagan, a popular Republican President who was able to gain the support of a good number of conservative Democrats, an ability that McCain would badly need to emulate.  While the convention had very high ratings starting with Palin's well received speech, it was unclear what the impact would be in the polls.  Indeed, Obama continued to lead directly afterward, but that soon changed with a turn of about 8 points and a slim lead for McCain.  The Republican convention had actually more than balanced out the powerful Democratic convention.
While Obama had stated that his campaign would avoid negative advertising, as it became clear that the bounce from the convention was continuing to last and he might lose the election, his campaign turned more forcefully to negative advertising.  In ads aired since the Republican convention through mid September, McCain's ads were about Obama 56% of the time, but Obama's ads were about his opponents 77% of the time.[4]  Obama also received a large boost from the press which vigorously attacked McCain, but even more so Palin.  Obama appeared on The O'Reilly Factor and was treated with civility and respect, even if not with agreement.  McCain and his wife appeared on The View and were treated to openly antagonistic attacks.  The constant negative barrage and reporting slowly moved the numbers back to even.
As the negative articles on Palin continued to intensify, some of which just quoted celebrities who had never met her calling her ""whacko"" or a ""hater of women"", her first major interview with Gibson was a turning point.  Gibson asked Palin about the Bush Doctrine, but wouldn't define it for her even as she asked questions for clarifications.  When she then answered with her understanding, Gibson rebuked her by implying that she misunderstood the doctrine.  In truth, since the term is only a press invention, it has taken on different meanings at different times and the definition that Palin gave matched one that Gibson himself had used years earlier.  Nevertheless, it was a moment and was jumped on by the press.  Those who saw the interview voted heavily that they were now less likely to vote for Palin.  The attack on her had muted her effectiveness, even if it was unjustified.
Stemming the tide of the McCain campaign's lead became a strong swing for Obama with a series of events that went to the Democratic nominee's favor.  The polls began to tack to Obama's favor with the collapse of Lehman Brothers and a subsequent 500-point drop in the Dow Jones Index.  Then, President Bush sounded a major alarm on the economy and proposed a huge 700 billion dollar rescue plan for the mortgage industry, which sent shock waves through the American populace and swept them with even more fear on the economic picture.  Bush called both Presidential nominees to meet with him and Congress.  It gave Obama a boost in legitimacy, his previous Achilles' heel.  While he had a weak record in accomplishments and showing leadership, the chance to be propelled to a position of prominence handed it to him on a silver platter.  Moreover, the plan was more problematic among Republicans than it was among Democrats, giving Obama another boost merely by supporting it while putting McCain on more shaky ground.  Both candidates supported it once again blurring McCain's advantage in experience if both men were seen as interchangeable in their reaction.
McCain chose to suspend his campaign until a deal on the rescue package was reached, a mistake.  The Democrats could add pork to the plan and make it even more unpalatable to the Republicans, and they did.  As the first debate loomed and no deal had been reached, McCain was in a quandary.  He chose to attend the debate under the view that the plan was well under way to being passed.  After the debate the plan was actually defeated and wouldn't be adopted, with more changes, until the following week.
McCain's debate with Obama went well and he was viewed as having done better than expected.  Unfortunately for him, Obama was also viewed as doing better than expected and was seen as looking Presidential, further cementing his standing and locking in a lead in the polls that had become rather substantial.  The Vice Presidential debate was the most watched in history and Palin was given high marks for her performance, but unfortunately for the Republican ticket, Biden was also on his game that night and also came across well.  There were no changes in the polling numbers and the number of undecided voters began to quickly dwindle.  The second and third debates caused little change as well.
With Obama spending 110 million dollars on TV advertising in October alone, including 30 minute specials on each of the major networks, McCain was hard pressed to make up the necessary ground to win the election after being outspent by 3 to 1 for TV adds over that time period.  He couldn't count on regular TV to help put in a good word for him either, as late night political jokes are running at a pace of 7 jokes against McCain/Palin for every 1 joke against Obama/Biden and a study of news stories on McCain and Obama since the end of the conventions found that 57% of news stories about McCain were negative while only 29% were for Obama.[5]  A later study by the independent Pew Research Center found that the discrepancy had grown even worse.  McCain had 57% of the articles about him negative while only 14% were positive, while Obama had more positive articles than negative.  The only network to achieve a balance, 40% negative for both, was Fox News.[6]

General Strategy
McCain's team emphasized to convince the electorate of the long-term leadership and experience that John McCain has shown in two decades of government service while emphasizing the relative untested nature of Barack Obama.
Obama's team stressed that Obama is the candidate of fresh ideas while downplaying his relative inexperience compared to the more seasoned McCain.  When possible, McCain is lumped together with George Bush, an unpopular President.

Republican Strategy
With more limited funding than his Democratic rival, McCain had favored open town hall meetings to attract the greatest number of people.  He is focusing his advertising on swing states.  He also asked for open debates with Obama of the Lincoln-Douglas variety where candidates can talk directly to each other, but this was not accepted by the Democratic camp which prefers the current structured format.
McCain will highlight his record of leadership, his service to his country and stress that as President he can be counted on to keep America safe from outside threats.  McCain's strongest supporters are the elderly - the group that most wants stability.
McCain's choice of Sarah Palin as his Vice Presidential nominee was a departure from what was expected and helped to show that he would go down paths that the Republican party had not done in the past.  McCain has touted Palin's record of standing up to the Alaska Republican party when she resigned from an Ethics Commission in protest over a lack of ethics of fellow commissioners, as well as when she ran against, and beat, then-incumbent Governor Frank Murkowski in the Republican primary in 2006.  McCain will continue to tout her as a ""maverick"" to complement his own maverick image that he is trying to emphasize. Last, by choosing a female running mate, McCain hoped to pick up the votes of female voters disaffected with the perceived slight of Hillary Clinton by Obama.  Prior to the start of the Democratic convention, 30% of Hillary's supporters had still not backed Obama and there was a good deal of bad blood between the two.
With the unfolding of the campaign season and watching the Democratic strategy and how it was playing out in the press and polls, the McCain campaign decided not to cede the moniker of change to Obama, but rather to take it upon themselves by emphasizing that McCain has a track record of change - while Obama does not.  The McCain campaign feels it needs to have the voters ask who can be trusted more to get the job done, and if that occurs, then they have the advantage.
With the selection of Palin, and the energy it has brought to the conservative base, McCain has taken to larger rallies, as opposed to town hall meetings and press conferences.  By mid-September, he had gone four weeks without a town hall, and three weeks without a press conference, instead sticking to larger engagements, appearing alongside his vice presidential nominee, with larger crowds than he had experienced earlier in his campaign.

Democratic Strategy
Democrats are confident that the low popularity of President Bush and particularly Operation Iraqi Freedom, which John McCain supports, puts them in a highly favorable position for 2008.  They have been cautious in the Iraq arena realizing that 'The Surge' worked and they were on the wrong end of that issue.  Focus is being put on a timeline for troops coming home, a position that most of the American population favors.
Democrats believe it is their race to lose, but also realize they had a good chance to win the last two Presidential elections and came up short each time.  General wisdom also states that a poor economy favors Obama, so they will emphasize the dire times in this area.  As in past elections, differences between those who have obtained a high income level and those who have not will be emphasized. In fact, the Democratic strategy in many ways mirrors that of their strategy in 1992 when the Democrat-controlled Congress deliberately caused economic disruption, knowing full well that the public would blame sitting president George H.W. Bush, and thereby allowing Bill Clinton to win that year's presidential race.
Favored by the young, Democrats will try hard to encourage and get out the young vote, a task that has proven more difficult than expected in the last two election cycles.  To their advantage, Obama made his vice presidential pick via text message to cell phone numbers registered on the site.  The announcement went to 3 million cell phones, a useful database for ""Get Out The Vote"" (GOTV) efforts, when voters may not be home or reachable on their landline.
As an extension of the DNC's strategy in the 2006 elections, led by Howard Dean, Barack Obama has been working towards a ""50-state strategy.""  The campaign is working to place campaign offices throughout the country with a focus on voter registration.  The increase in the rolls of Democratic voters from the primary battle between Hillary Clinton and Obama played out well for the Democrats and puts pressure on Senator McCain even in typically red states, and more specifically, ""Lean Republican"" states, to use the Cook Political Report's term.  In addition, with a fundraising advantage, Obama is airing ads in those tight states forcing McCain to make decisions about whether to use funds to match ads and campaign efforts in those states or rely on historical results that those states will support him and focus funds in traditional toss-up states instead.

Fundraising
Barack Obama had a significant edge over Hillary Clinton in the fundraising department during their contest for the Democratic nomination, but both actually set records for raising money and both raised far more money than John McCain.  McCain didn't have to spend as much since he locked up the Republican nomination much earlier than Obama locked up the Democratic.  Both Obama and McCain said they would accept government funds—which would also cap how much the candidates could raise on their own—but Obama, who could presumably raise more through his own sources, changed his mind and later declined.  Much of McCain's war chest will come from the Republican Party in general, which has more money to spend than their Democratic counterparts.  McCain's campaign raised $47 million in August, a very sizable figure for him so far and a personal record, but not as strong as Obama's best months. In the same time period, Obama set a record with $66 million. Obama, still having an edge in fundraising that has continued throughout his run for the Presidency, saw $10 million collected the day after Sarah Palin's strongly received convention speech, a new one day record.[7]  The Palin announcement has been good for John McCain's fundraising as well.
Obama set a new record of $150 million raised in September and over $600 million overall.[8]  Obama's camp does not release information on who contributes to the campaign.


Conventions
Democratic National Convention
For a more detailed treatment, see 2008 Democratic National Convention.
The 2008 Democratic National Convention was held in Denver, Colorado, from August 25 to August 27 at Pepsi Center. There, Senator Obama and his running mate were selected to be the party nominee's. Barack Obama will accepted the party's nomination in front of a crowd of more than 75,000 in a free, open event held at INVESCO Field at Mile High, in a platform resemblant to a Greek temple. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is the Permanent Chair of the Convention.
The convention had a rocky start as friction between supporters of Obama and the Clintons was not resolved.  Instead of Obama getting a bump in the polls, his support actually declined.  The Democrats also seemed to be at odds on finding a unifying strategy for how hard to attack John McCain and how to present it.  As Democratic pundit James Carville said in an interview on CNN, ""If this party has a message, it's done a <heck> of a job hiding it tonight, I promise you that.""[9]
A bleak convention was turned around by the Clintons. Infighting between Obama and Hillary continued through the day of her speech, but a comprise was reached, and, beyond expectations, she gave a rousing speech for Obama - possibly as an angry response to McCain's latest ad that showed her 'supporting' him. Bill Clinton the next night also praised Obama, something that he failed to effectively do in 2000 for Al Gore when he centered on his accomplishments and gave little more than lip service to Gore with statements amounting to 'and Al Gore was there too'. The convention, possibly remembering that, gave him the topic he was to speak on instead of choosing his own. Clinton was angered, but it worked. He came through. By the time Obama spoke on the last night, the theme that was missing at first was clear, and Obama mixed a message of attacking McCain with the need for change and even outlining some expensive programs that would appeal to the target populace who has been lukewarm to him. From a political point of view, the convention did what it was supposed to.


Republican National Convention
For a more detailed treatment, see 2008 Republican National Convention.
The 2008 Republican National Convention was held in Saint Paul, Minnesota from September 1 (Labor Day) until September 4. The presumptive nominee was Senator McCain. The location has political significance in that Minnesota will likely be a close state during the general election, as will its neighboring states Wisconsin and Iowa.
The convention schedule had to be altered due to the upcoming landfall of Hurricane Gustav. The first day almost entirely focused on raising money for Hurricane relief.  This led to a shortened three day convention instead of four and there was some shuffling of who was speaking on which day to accommodate the suddenly shortened time span.  In a surprise, George W. Bush was only delivered an eight-minute speech by satellite.  In another surprise Sarah Palin's speech was watched by as many people as saw Obama give his acceptance speech on the closing night of the Democratic convention, as over 40 million people tuned in.[10]  She was considered the highlight of the convention, even surpassing John McCain's speech the next day, and was noted for doing an exceptional job.  Recognizing the strong asset that they have in her, the Republicans made reference to her many times on the last day of the convention.  McCain, not known for being comfortable reading prepared speeches in a convention hall, delivered a solid speech.  While Obama continued to enjoy a lead in the polls, it changed quickly thereafter to a slight McCain-Palin edge.  The Republican convention more than canceled out a very powerful Democratic convention.

Leftist violence
 Poster circulated by community organizers. Other posters depicted rock throwers with the caption, ""Shut Down the RNC!,"" dead elephants, and derogatory and demeaning comments about gay Republicans. [2]
Progressives for Obama shares a huge membership overlap with the Movement for a Democratic Society (MDS), a group of former Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) members and sympathisers. MDS re-founded SDS in 2006 for a new generation of college students and functions as a support group for SDS's 130 college chapters. Independent researcher Trevor Louden refers to MDS as ""the brains behind the SDS brawn.""  The reconstituted SDS was very prominent in the violence at the Republican National Convention at St Paul.[11] The founder of ACORN, Wade Rathke, denouncd[12] an FBI informer who foiled a terrorist plot to kill delegates at the Republican Convention.[13]

Vice Presidential Candidates
Democratic Vice-Presidential Candidate
On August 23, Senator Barack Obama announced, via text message to 3 million cell phone numbers of his supporters, his nomination of Joseph Biden to Vice President.  Biden's selection was considered to be a prudent move by Obama, filling a hole in his own foreign policy experience that McCain could exploit.  With the implosion of John Edwards, Biden was widely expected to be the choice.  In order to help build up suspense, Biden said he was not chosen when he spoke to the press the day before, only to be shown as the Vice Presidential candidate the next day.  A long-term senator and Washington insider with over two decades of service in the Senate, his earlier 1988 plagiarism scandal and frequent gaffes (including one in which he insulted Obama in a racist manner during the 2008 election) were deemed to be less negative than the positive that his strong experience credentials could bring to the race.  

 Joseph Biden




Republican Vice-Presidential Candidate

Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska was announced as John McCain's choice early on Friday, August 29, the day after the Democratic convention ended.  A surprise choice not even considered by the press to be on McCain's short list, her selection caught the political world off guard.  It had been expected that Mitt Romney would earn the honor, but McCain had other ideas.  At first denigrated by the people in the Obama campaign, Obama's own statement was one of cautious neutrality to feel out what impact her selection would have on the race.


In an interesting twist, the selection of the Vice Presidential candidates changed the dynamics of the race.  By Obama picking Biden, he helped to fill the hole that McCain had been attacking dealing with a lack of foreign policy experience.  McCain's strongest point, experience, would lose some of its luster.  But the selection of Biden, and the passing over of Hillary Clinton, left another opening.  By aligning himself with someone who has been a Democratic stalwart, Obama's claim to change became less pronounced.  McCain seized upon that to select a Vice President that no one expected, and a woman, and steal some of the Democratic thunder.  Her lack of foreign policy experience would cut into the experience angle that had been in play earlier, but her own maverick streak in becoming governor by ousting another Republican, combined with John McCain's maverick choice in selecting her led to a new emphasis on McCain's own maverick past. Palin arguably had more ""executive"" / managerial experience than either McCain, Biden or, notably, Obama.  Suddenly he saw an opportunity to steal the moniker of change that Obama had been wearing, and he went for it.  Such a change in position occurring from the Vice Presidential selection is rare in Presidential politics.

Debates
Presidential Debates
For a more detailed treatment, see 2008 Presidential Debates.
There have been three presidential debates for the 2008 election season.  The first debate on September 26 discussed ""Foreign Policy & National Security"" and also dealt at length with the economic crisis. The result was a statistical draw where both candidates did better than expected in the eyes of the public.  The longer term impact worked out well for Obama who already had a lead going in, and benefited from solidifying that position.
The second debate on October 7, followed a town hall-style.  The questions came from audience members and the Internet, as chosen by the moderator.  Again the result was a statistical draw as far as who was considered to be the winner.  But with time running out for McCain, he needed something to make the people move his way, and that required a clear breakthrough that never happened
The final debate was held on October 15 concerned ""Domestic and Economic Policy."" Both candidates were again viewed as having done well, which was a tactical defeat for McCain as the poll numbers showed only small changes.

Vice Presidential Debate
There was one vice presidential debate held on October 2.  Palin did much better than expected, but Biden was also in top form.  No clear winner emerged and the poll numbers remained largely unchanged, a strategic win for the Democratic ticket that only had to maintain their lead to win the election.  The number of people who watched the debate was an alltime record for a Vice Presidential debate, and was viewed by more people than any of the three Presidential debates.

Third parties and Independents
As usual there were a number of third party candidates, but none made much of an impact.  Briefly the Libertarian Bob Barr had enough strength to become a spoiler for McCain.  He faded quickly. See United States Presidential Election, 2008 -- Third Party Candidates.

Primaries
For expanded primary information, see United States Presidential Election, 2008 - Primaries
The primary season for both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party officially began on January 3, 2008 with the Iowa Caucuses and ended on June 3, 2008.[14]  The 2008 election cycle saw a major shift in the primary election calendar, frontloading many primaries into early February.[15]
John McCain had to get his footing at first, but was pretty much assured the Republican nomination after Super Tuesday.  Barack Obama had a much tougher road, but rode out a string of victories in February to eventually outlast Clinton and take the nomination.  During that time he had raised more money than any other candidate in history giving him a huge boost, a trend that would continue into the general election.

2008 recession,https://www.conservapedia.com/2008_recession,"The Recession of 2008 (also called the Recession of the late 2000s or the Great Recession) was a major worldwide economic downturn that began in 2008 and continued into 2010 and beyond. It was caused by the Financial Crisis of 2008; it was by far the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The worldwide recession hit bottom in December 2009; however after five years there were few signs that the American economy started moving upward again. Five million of the 8 million jobs lost[1] did not return - despite an increase in population of 10 million over the same span of time covering President Barack Obama's first term.[2]
Greece, Portugal and Ireland remain in serious trouble, while China and Brazil rebounded and are growing rapidly. Concerning the United States economy, some proponents of free market capitalism declare that  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and the United States Congress should not have bailed out failing firms and instead should have allowed free market capitalism to recover as it did in the depression of 1920, which recovered without government intervention (free market capitalists assert that government intervention can drag out recessions and depressions).[3][4] A 2005 study found that government corporate bailouts are often done for mere political considerations and the economic resources allocated exhibit significantly worse economic performance than resources allocated using purely business considerations.[5]
Likewise in the U.S. the economy has stabilized but showed little signs of recovery during President Obama's first term, apart from the stock market going up. Serious weaknesses continued in housing, commercial real estate, banking, automobiles, and retail trade. Unemployment remained above 8% til October 2012 with conditions especially poor in California, Michigan and South Carolina.


The crisis was worldwide, with major impact in Britain, Europe (that is the ""European Union"" or EU), Russia, Japan, the oil countries of the Middle East, and the developing world.  The economy of the EU (Europe)  shrank by 4% in 2009, with unemployment reaching 10%. Ireland, Iceland and parts of Eastern Europe are hardest hit.  Britain was hit hard with its major banks in deep trouble. Recovery in Britain remains slow; its GDP fell 5.2% from 3Q 2008 to 3Q 2009.[6]
Global trade declined sharply—by 13% from August 20008 to August 2009, hurting exporters such as Germany and Japan.  China has avoided most of the troubles; it continued to grow at a phenomenal rate (8.9% annual rate in 2008-9). However its exports did shrink because of falling world demand, and its ability to fund global stimulus programs are being dampened by lower growth forecasts and shifting priorities to retain capital earnings for domestic development.
Global governments spent an astonishing $17 trillion to support the world economy in the form of bailouts, guarantees, and equity market purchases. That $17 trillion represents one quarter of global GDP, but only a fraction of that sum will actually be paid out.[7]  Global investment declined by 15% , and global GDP by shrank by nearly $4 trillion, or an amazing 6%.  Global industrial production in the advanced economies dropped a 15%, causing unemployment  to soar around the world, nearly doubling in the United States alone.[8]

Fannie Mae Origins
Main aticle: Fannie Mae
The recession began in January 2008 in the financial sector as major banks in the U.S. and Europe got into serious trouble after a decade and a half of investing in bad mortgages. The crisis spread globally due to the fact that many banks, businesses, and pension funds worldwide had invested in these securitized debts. Trouble spread to the automobile industry, where General Motors and Chrysler went bankrupt in spring 2009, due to a decrease in US consumer demand. They remained solvent by a bailout involving a taxpayer buy out and bankruptcy reorganization was authorized by President Barack Obama and Congressional Democrats. Existing shareholders received 22 cents on the dollar for their investment, and the unions made no concessions.
Leftists have incorrectly attributed the cause of the recession to Bush Administration policies, calling it the ""Bush Recession."" However, many people recognize the loosening of credit guidelines in the Clinton era and government guarantees for subprime lending encouraged banks to make foolish loans which they considered had minimal risk to themselves. This, together with the threat of civil rights lawsuits under the Community Reinvestment Act were the mortgage lenders primary motivations.
In the U.S. GDP fell in the fourth quarter of 2008 (October–November–December), by 6.2% annual rate, with declines heaviest in business investment, exports, finance, autos, housing, construction, and retail sales.[9] The steep decline continued; GDP in the first quarter of 2009 (January–February–March) fell at the annualized rate of 6.1%, much worse than expected.  American business slashed capital investment at an annual rate of -38%. Investment in software and computer equipment declined by an annualized 33.8%, and investment in new buildings was down 44.2%.  By Spring 2009, financial markets that spiralled out of control in late 2008 stabilized, and declines in retail sales and orders by manufacturers no longer posted record declines.[10]
The stock market fell by 50% in 2008, wiping out trillions of dollars in assets. More trillions were lost as housing prices fell by 20%. Adding together the declines in housing and the stock market, the net worth of American households declined from $63.7 trillion in January 2008 to $51.5 trillion in January 2009, a decline of $11.2 trillion or 18%. That is, Americans owned $11 trillion less wealth, and adjusted by buying less and investing less. Meanwhile, mortgages and credit-card debt together reached $13 trillion, or 123% of after-tax income, a huge jump since 1995, when it was 83% of income.[11]
Bankruptcies among small businesses soared from 206 a day in Dec. 2007 to 357 a day in March 2009.  In April, 2009, came the largest real estate bankruptcy in history, as General Growth, which owned and managed more than 200 malls, proved unable to handle its crushing $27 billion debt load. The debt was created by heavy borrowing in optimistic days to build new malls. 
Wealth levels plunged worldwide. Stock markets in other major countries fell even faster than in the United States.  Most companies worldwide reported reduced sales and sharply reduced profits, as banks refused to lend and consumers refused to spend, fearing the worst.  
A series of emergency measures enacted by the Federal Reserve (on its own authority) and Congress after heavy prodding by presidents Bush and Obama resulted in trillions of dollars in loans, banking bailouts and guarantees, a half-trillion new stimulus spending[12][13] and a third of a trillion in tax cuts, but by mid-March 2009 the outlook remained bleak as the economy continued downward.  Therefore, the Federal Reserve announced yet another trillion dollar plan on March 18, this one to buy $300 billion in Treasury bonds, and $750 billion in mortgage-backed securities. The idea was to keep mortgage rates low in the hope people will start buying houses again, but the problem was that the prices were falling, so that if a person bought a $500,000 house in 2009 it would be worth $400,000 a year later, despite the Fed's intervention.
In the first quarter of 2009 (January 1 to March 30), GDP fell sharply in major countries compared to the fourth quarter of 2008.  In the US GDP was down 6.3%.
Major export countries saw their markets shrink. Exports from Japan were down 41% (quarter one 2009 versus 2008), Germany 32%, China 20% and U.S. 22%.
Major  countries began experimenting again with Keynesian stimulus packages, including the US ($787 billion), Europe (EU, $634 billion), China ($586 billion), and Japan ($486 billion), but no positive results were reported[14][15]  Central banks (such as the Federal Reserve in the U.S.) cut interest rates to nearly zero for half a decade, but few businesses borrowed money to expand employment or meet current operating expenses.
By September 2012 when job growth still lagged by 4 million people, economists Garett Jones and Daniel Rothschild wrote,

This suggests just how hard it is for Keynesian job creation to work in a modern, expertise-based economy. The stimulus was implemented at a time when the Keynesian model had every chance of succeeding on its own terms. The high level of unemployment and the rapid deadline for spending created both the supply of workers and the demand for workers. If the job market results are so lackluster in this setting, economists should expect even weaker stimulative results during more modest recessions.
And the Wall Street Journal observed:

The lesson of such on-the-ground knowledge is that the stimulus was a lost opportunity. In practice it became a shotgun marriage between an economic theory justified by computer models and 40 years of liberal social priorities (clean energy, Medicaid expansions and the rest). This produced the 9.1% unemployment we now have.[16] 
Indicators down
Oil, metal and grain (rice, wheat, corn) prices, after hitting record levels in the summer of 2008, plunged. Crude oil went from $145 a barrel to $42.[17]
Retail sales in the U.S. and worldwide went into a major slump, with the slowest Christmas shopping season in decades.  American manufacturing contracted in November 2008 at the steepest rate in 26 years. The U.S. lost some 4 million jobs in 2008,[18] the worst record since the end of World War II,  Factory indexes in China, Britain, Europe, and Russia all fell to record lows. 
In January 2009 the downturn worsened, as major companies and small firms announced round after round of layoffs and postponement of expansion plans.  The financial sector worsened sharply in January, indicating the huge financial bailouts of 2008 were inadequate. The steep slide continued as unsold goods piled up. The GDP (gross domestic product) shrank at a -6.2% annual rate in the fourth quarter (last three months) of 2008, the sharpest contraction in 26 years.[19]
Meanwhile, at the urging of the Obama Administration, Congress passed a $789 billion stimulus package, combining new spending and tax cuts, in the hopes of Keynesian revival by mid-2009.  Republicans were nearly unanimous against the proposal, as their smaller package was voted down. Canada, although not as hard hit as the U.S., prepared its own stimulus package. 

see also Economic stimulus package
Economists from all political viewpoints predicted the slide in GDP was likely to continue at an alarming pace well into summer 2009 as consumers curtailed spending and businesses reduced their capital investments and cut payrolls.

Income and Wealth
Wealth holding took a heavy blow. Incomes were down too, but not as dramatically.

 Personal income; change from previous year
Money
In terms of a monetary explanation, there is far more money around, due to the stimulus programs of the Federal Reserve, Treasury, and Congress. However the velocity (turnover rate) is down to the lowest rate since 1991.  That is, people and business are saving and not spending.  Banks are not lending. The nation’s banks in March 2009 had reserves of $679 billion, up from only $45 billion in August 2008.  Individuals are keeping their cash in the banks, or paying off credit cards and debts, and not buying new merchandise.  The goal of federal stimulus spending is to get consumer spending going, to create jobs and keep businesses from slowing down.[20] If people do start spending again all the extra money will cause inflation, but in that case the Federal Reserve plans to reduce the money supply and, hopefully, restore normalcy and prosperity.[21]

 
US
The longest economic slumps since 1945 were the 16-month downturns that ended in March 1975 and November 1982. The Great Depression lasted 43 months, from August 1929 to March 1933. 
""This may be referred to as the Great Recession,"" because of its length, said Norbert Ore, chairman of the Institute for Supply Management’s factory survey. ""It looked like we were headed for a shallow recession earlier in the year because of higher energy prices. With the meltdown in the financial sector, it has become something more serious.""[22]

 Construction spending--change from previous year
Housing
see Housing
The construction of new housing and commercial buildings has fallen off; many commercial buildings and shopping centers have high vacancy rates and may be hard pressed to pay their debts. Housing prices continue low—falling from an average of $255,000 to $180,000, as millions of empty houses are a drag on the market.  Indeed, much of the housing activity in 2009 involved sales of foreclosed properties at distress prices.

 
Auto sector
The automobile industry was in desperate crisis, with General Motors and Chrysler, and numerous parts suppliers, on the verge of bankruptcy.  Ford was in better shape as were the ""transplants"" like Toyota and Honda that have factories in the U.S. If GM were to shut down, many parts suppliers also would shut, forcing the end of most of GM's North American auto production. Autos would still be imported, though at higher than former prices.  GM and Chrysler were given $17 billion TARP funds in December on condition they present a turnaround plan by Feb. 17, 2009. In its plan GM asked for access to an additional $16.6 billion in federal aid. GM also said it would close 14 U.S. plants, and cut 47,000 global hourly, salaried jobs, and revoke dealerships.  Bankruptcy, GM claimed, could cost the federal government the loss of tax revenue and the loss of 1.3 million jobs across the US, as plants and dealers close down operation.[23]

 
In March 2009 GM reported that its auditors raised substantial doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern, citing recurring losses from operations, stockholders' deficit and an inability to generate enough cash to meet its obligations.  GM received $13.4 billion in federal loans, and the company asked for a total of $30 billion from the government. Since 2006 it ran up $82 billion in losses, including $30.9 billion in 2008.  Bankruptcy took place June 1, 2009. With federal help, GM ultimately escaped bankruptcy law (see Crony capitalism).

 
Unemployment
After the full implementation of the George W. Bush tax cuts, unemployment reached a low of 4.1% by October, 2006. After the Fannie Mae crash, the U.S. unemployment rate began trending upward, reaching 9.4% in May 2009. Analysts from the National Bureau of Economic research say that the current nationwide recession began in December 2007. Unemployment reached 6.5% by election day 2008, and in some parts of the country already reached 10% and higher.

Worldwide crisis
The crisis is worse in many other countries, which means they are dragging down the US economy and cannot be expected to be the engine to restore prosperity.  Japan’s economy, the world’s second largest after the U.S., is deteriorating rapidly because of shrinking exports and weak domestic spending. Japan's GDP shrank at an annual rate of 12.7% in the fourth quarter of 2008, and the downward plunge shows no sign of reversal. 
Japan's exports to the U.S. and other areas are down sharply, causing massive layoffs at companies like Nissan, Toyota, Panasonic and Sony. Capital spending on tools and factories has fallen as companies halted production lines and cut investment. Consumer spending has stalled as Japanese households reduced spending amid the large-scale layoffs.  The government has promised a huge bailout package on the order of  50 trillion yen ($545 billion), but has been unable to get it passed in parliament.[24]
The economies in Europe and Russia are headed down, as are most third world countries. Eastern Europe is very hard hit, as is Ireland and Iceland.  Economic growth in China continues at a much lower pace than usual, throwing tens of millions out of work there.  The oil producing nations have seen their revenues plunge with the decline of oil prices.

U.S. Politics
The Obama Administration based its domestic policies on the assumption that its stimulus package passed in February, 2009, would turn around the economy.  The stimulus money has been spent slowly and little impact was visible by 212.  The Treasury assumed that the tax revenue would be there to fund permanent new spending programs in areas such as health care and greening the economy.  It assumed that the rich will recover enough to pay new, increased taxes. Tax collections only returned to the 2007 alltime, pre-recession level in 2012.  The deficit for fiscal 2009 alone was an astonishing $1.4 trillion, or 10% of GDP. To maintain the appearance of business as usual, keep Social Security and disability payments flowing and maintain defence spending, the federal government added $5 trillion to the national debt with borrowed money from abroad.
Obama delayed the recovery and kept unemployment high to permanently expand government spending, and reduce the size and increase the burdens of the private sector.[25] In the words of Rahm Emanuel, ""you don't want a crisis to go to waste.""

Economists
The vast majority of the world's economists and economic forecasters—whether liberal or conservative—were caught unaware by the housing bubble and the banking crisis. Nearly all misjudged the depth of the economic downturn; they were baffled by the inability of orthodox monetary policy administered by the Federal Reserve to prevent such a steep downturn. They could not agree on what, if anything, the government should do to halt it and return to recovery. By 2010, many were in general agreement with the Obama administration's Keynesian strategy. However, some say the government is not doing enough and is too cozy with the bankers, while others say that it is doing too much and warn about a lackadaisical recovery and dangerous long-term consequences. Added to that, implementation of Obamacare beginning in 2013 increases more burdens forecasted to retard job growth and lower tax collections.  There is no professional consensus on the details of what should be done to end the downturn, speed recovery, or prevent a recurrence.

.50 AE,https://www.conservapedia.com/.50_AE,"The .50 Action Express is a large-bore handgun cartridge designed in 1988 by Evan Whildin, primarily for use in Magnum Research's Desert Eagle handgun. It was later used in Magnum Research's Big Frame Revolver, as well as some other weapons by other companies.
Due to the heavy recoil of such a large caliber bullet, smaller cartridges that are still easily lethal are generally preferred for self-defense. Use for such a high caliber usually involves metallic silhouette shooting or handgun hunting. It is also used for self-defense against thick-skinned animals that would not normally be killed by smaller cartridges, like bear. Hunters or people living in areas with animals like bears would need such a gun.

1980 Presidential election,https://www.conservapedia.com/1980_Presidential_election," President Carter with Governor Reagan
President Jimmy Carter had lost the confidence of America due to economic problems and the hostages in Iran. Although incumbent Presidents usually win renomination easily, Carter had to fight a tough, long primary battle against Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy. At the time, several candidates fervently sought the Republican nomination for the Presidency. Former CIA director George H. W. Bush was a leading candidate and led for a time. Former Hollywood actor and conservative two term governor of California, Ronald Reagan, however, badly wanted the nomination and made many more speaking engagements. Reagan was then able to sweep the primaries and win the nomination. One of the other Republican candidates was liberal Illinois Representative John Anderson. Reagan considered having former President Gerald Ford as his running-mate, referred to as the ""dream ticket,"" but Ford wanted more presidential power than Reagan was willing to give him.  Reagan instead chose his lead rival, George H. W. Bush, as his running-mate, but ran the risk of giving ammunition to his enemies since during the primary race Bush had referred to Reagan's economic policies as ""voodoo economics."" 
Anderson, not satisfied to accept his defeat, ran as a third-party candidate and gained traction because of his moderate views.  Although it is hard to imagine today, at that time the options of Reagan and Carter were considered weak, with many people dissatisfied with the choices.
Reagan was able to do better than Carter in their speaking appearances, which culminated in a live Presidential Debate between the two candidates shortly before the election. Reagan used Carter's own words against him when he brought up Carter's use of the term 'the misery index' to describe the suffering of the American people when he was running for President against Ford in 1976.  Carter defined it as the sum of the unemployment rate and inflation rate.  Unfortunately for Carter, the value of the misery index, which he had charged in 1976 was too high, was much higher in 1980 as Reagan pointed out.  Reagan then boldly asked his audience at the end of his debate with Carter, ""Next Tuesday all of you will go to the polls; you'll stand there and make a decision, it might be well if you would ask yourself: Are you better off than you were four years ago?""
President Carter faced a difficult reelection. Iranian Islamists were holding 53 members of the American embassy staff hostage and the rescue attempt had failed miserably, Castro flooded Florida with Cuban refugees, there was a national oil shortage resulting in increased gasoline prices, high unemployment, and 18 percent inflation. Reagan ran as a Washington outsider as the Republican nominee. The centerpiece of the Reagan campaign was his record as an effective Governor, where he is credited for reducing California’s deficit while lowering taxes, and pointing out the  failures of the Carter administration. Reagan's campaign gained strong financing support from political action committees (PAC), receiving $12 million from PAC's, compared to $50,000 on Carter’s behalf. Carter tried to cast his presidency in the best possible light, stressing the 1978 Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt. He portrayed himself as a peacemaker and Reagan as a warmonger. Although because of Reagan's cool and confident manner, this proved to be ineffective.

Result
While the polls had been showing a close race up until a week before the election, when the election finally came up, Reagan held a surprisingly strong victory.  Carter capitulated while voting was still going on in the west, which angered his party as many Democratic Congressmen lost their elections after that and blamed Carter for his premature announcement that caused a number of Democratic voters not to go to the polls.[1]

1946 Faroese independence referendum,https://www.conservapedia.com/1946_Faroese_independence_referendum,"The 1946 Faroese independence referendum was a referendum held in order to determine the future of the Faroe Islands. It was held on 14 September 1946, in response to a growing independence movement.  
The results of the referendum were slightly confusing, with 48.7% supporting complete independence from Denmark, 47.1% in favor of the present arrangement, and the rest simply writing ""no"".  On September 18, the Faroese Løgting (parliament) declared independence, but on 20 September this act was annulled by the Danes and on the 24th King Christian X dissolved the Løgting.  
After new elections were held and further negotiations were made, Denmark finally granted the Faroese more autonomy with the 1948 Home Rule Act.

 Moses with the Ten Commandments by Rembrandt (1659)
The Ten Commandments, or the Decalogue, are a set of laws which were given to Moses by God, as found in the books of Exodus and Deuteronomy. The biblical text of the Ten Commandments is differently divided according to denominational traditions. The Orthodox and Catholic tradition traces back to the 3rd and 4th centuries. The Protestant tradition traces back to the 16th century Reformation.
Catholic and Orthodox Ten Commandments[1]

1. I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods beside me. Thou shalt not make to thyself an idol, nor likeness of anything, whatever things are in the heaven above, and whatever are in the earth beneath, and whatever are in the waters under the earth. Thou shalt not bow down to them, nor serve them; for I am the Lord thy God, a jealous God, recompensing the sins of the fathers upon the children, to the third and fourth generation to them that hate me, and bestowing mercy on them that love me to thousands of them, and on them that keep my commandments. 
2. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord thy God will not acquit him that takes his name in vain. 
3. Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days thou shalt labour, and shalt perform all thy work. But on the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; on it thou shalt do no work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy servant nor thy maidservant, thine ox nor thine ass, nor any cattle of thine, nor the stranger that sojourns with thee. For in six days the Lord made the heaven and the earth, and the sea and all things in them, and rested on the seventh day; therefore the Lord blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it. 
4. Honour thy father and thy mother, that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest live long on the good land, which the Lord thy God gives to thee. 
5. Thou shalt not commit adultery. 
6. Thou shalt not steal. 
7. Thou shalt not kill.[2]
8. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. 
9. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife;
10. thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house; nor his field, nor his servant, nor his maid, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any of his cattle, nor whatever belongs to thy neighbor.[3]
Protestant Ten Commandments[4]

1. I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. 
2. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments. 
3. Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. 
4. Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. 
5. Honor thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.  
6. Thou shalt not murder.[5]
7. Thou shalt not commit adultery. 
8. Thou shalt not steal. 
9. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.  
10. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbor's.[6]

Background
There are two versions, generally similar but somewhat different in wording: Exodus 20:2-17[7] and Deuteronomy 5:6-21.[8] The version in Deuteronomy adds the detail of Moses saying that God ""delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God."" (KJV)
The Bible itself refers to there being ""ten commandments"" in Exodus 34:28[9] and Deuteronomy 4:13,[10] but it is not clear how to parcel out the fifteen or sixteen verses into ten commandments, and different religious groups have done this in different ways.
The Protestant Ten Commandments, stressing their opposition to statues, contain ""Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image"" as the 2nd commandment. The Catholic Ten Commandments include it as part of the first commandment against having other gods, and divide  ""Thou shalt not covet"" into ""...thy neighbor's wife"" (9th) the wife having far more dignity than mere property (chattal), and ""...thy neighbor's goods"" (10th) which are property.[11]

""Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife:
""nor his house, nor his field, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is his."" (Deuteronomy 5:21, Douay-Rheims Bible)
The Jewish Ten Commandments contain ""I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery"" as the 1st commandment, with their 2nd commandment combining the first two Protestant commandments ""Thou shalt have no other gods before me: thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image...thou shalt not bow down thyself to them"", and their listing of the remainder of their ten follows the Protestant listing, making wives property.[12]
However, as Jewish people would also recognize, the Torah, or Law (the first five books of the Old Testament) actually contains not ten, but 613 positive and negative commandments. Thus, when Jesus is asked (at Matthew 22:34-36) which is the greatest commandment in the Law, he picks two of the other 603: 'You shall love the Lord thy God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength' (Deuteronomy 6:5) and 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself' (Leviticus 19:18).

The Ten Commandments in US law
In several controversies over the legality of displaying the Ten Commandments on government property, and especially outside courthouses, the influence of the Ten Commandments on US law (and western law in general) becomes relevant as proponents of the displays argue that these commandments form part of the foundation of the US legal system.

 Some official U.S. documents accept the existence of God, although there is no specifics in U.S. law as to who this God is, and the First Amendment to the Constitution is interpreted as opposing any attempt to impose the belief or non-belief in God.
 Similarly, the First Amendment forbids any legal means of enforcing the commandment about not worshiping idols.
 Nothing in current state or federal law specifically prohibits the taking in vain of God's name in general, but it may be in violation of broadcast decency laws if shown on television or radio.
 Past state laws have enforced the sabbath by forbidding various activities, such as the sale of specific goods, on Sundays. These, however, are all almost now repealed or struck down. Closure of shops on Sundays is by convention, but not legally enforced. However, some states still restrict the sale of alcohol on Sundays.  The seven-day week, however, is accepted worldwide, and most people observe at least one day free from work.
 No law enforces the commandment about honoring parents, and it is doubtful that it could be enforced. Liberals are currently attempting to undermine this commandment, by trying to make disciplining children illegal. In contrast, the Bible tells us the correct way to bring up a child and teach him to respect his parents: ""He who spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him is careful to discipline him."" (Proverbs 13:24)
 The commandment against murder is enforced by U.S. law.
 Criminal laws against adultery[13] are largely unenforced and of doubtful enforceability, but a showing of adultery will influence civil divorce proceedings and affect the distribution of assets.  Jesus clarified the definition of adultery, for instance in Matthew 8:27-32, to include remarriage after divorce in most cases. Until recently, it was difficult to get a divorce in most states other than Nevada for this reason; previously one had to prove fault with one's spouse, but since the 1950s that has changed in every state except New York. Today all states and many Christian denominations define adultery by the modern English definition[14] to allow remarriage after divorce. Many Christians believe that this commandment, which forbids adultery,[15] also forbids fornication.[16]
 The commandment against stealing is enforced by U.S. law. See also: Atheism and stealing
 When used during litigation, or otherwise spoken under oath (see perjury), the commandment against bearing false witness is enforced by U.S. law.  For someone to bear false witness against a neighbor in a less formal setting (e.g. lying to a third party about a neighbor in the course of private conversation) could, in some circumstances, be a tort, but rarely a crime.
 As a prohibition on a form of thought, the commandment against coveting what belongs to another cannot be enforced by legal means.
Controversies about displaying the Ten Commandments
In recent years, liberal attorneys and judges have opposed the display of the Ten Commandments on public property by exploiting the judicial system. Obama appointment, Judge Michael F. Urbanski, put forward the ridiculous idea of censoring the Ten Commandments by removing the first four to render them more secular.[17][18]  The ACLU, Freedom From Religion Foundation, and other liberal organizations regularly file lawsuits in an attempt to censor the display of the Ten Commandments. 
In 2003, Alabama Supreme Court chief justice Roy Moore was removed from office after refusing a court order to remove a statue of the Ten Commandments from the central rotunda of the Alabama Supreme Court Building.[19]

The movie
The Ten Commandments is also the title of a famous 1956 motion picture, produced and directed by Cecil B. DeMille and released by Paramount Pictures, starring Charlton Heston as Moses. It tells the story of Moses essentially as told in the Book of Exodus, with a few changes. 
As publicity for the film, and in conjunction with a project of the Fraternal Order of Eagles, Paramount helped finance the placement of hundreds of stone tablets engraved with the Ten Commandments. These were placed at courthouse squares, at city halls and in public parks, and became a controversy claimed by liberals and atheists, particularly in recent years, as to whether they violate the claimed separation of Church and State.

↑ The English translation of the Septuagint by Sir Lancelot L.C. Brenton (in the public domain) is quoted here. Both lists of the commandments in the Septuagint have the same sequence: Exodus 20:2-17 and Deuteronomy 5:6-21. However, the Douay-Rheims Bible translation of the Latin Vulgate from Jerome's translation of the Hebrew text, agrees with the King James Version in showing the same differences in sequence between the texts of Exodus 20:17 and Deuteronomy 5:21. The traditional Catholic and Orthodox teaching of the sequential division of the Ten Commandments is consistently according to the text of Deuteronomy instead of the text of Exodus emphasized by Protestant teaching. Italics in the English text have been inserted by the translator for the same reason as the King James translators inserted italics, to clarify the meaning and to indicate that they are not part of the original text.

↑ Catholic and Orthodox traditional understanding of this commandment interprets the intent of it as against the destruction of innocent human life, as distinct from capital punishment of the guilty and the conduct of righteous or just war against pagan idolaters in the promised land and aggressive invaders and oppressors, which was permitted and even commanded under the law of Moses.

Democratic National Convention
Summary
The 2008 Democratic National Convention was held in Denver, Colorado, from August 25 to August 27 at Pepsi Center. There, Senator Obama and his running mate were selected to be the party nominee's. Barack Obama will accepted the party's nomination in front of a crowd of more than 75,000 in a free, open event held at INVESCO Field at Mile High, in a platform resemblant to a Greek temple. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is the Permanent Chair of the Convention.
The convention had a rocky start as friction between supporters of Obama and the Clintons was not resolved.  Instead of Obama getting a bump in the polls, his support actually declined.  The Democrats also seemed to be at odds on finding a unifying strategy for how hard to attack John McCain and how to present it.  As Democratic pundit James Carville said in an interview on CNN, ""If this party has a message, it's done a <heck> of a job hiding it tonight, I promise you that.""[1]
A bleak convention was turned around by the Clintons. Infighting between Obama and Hillary continued through the day of her speech, but a comprise was reached, and, beyond expectations, she gave a rousing speech for Obama - possibly as an angry response to McCain's latest ad that showed her 'supporting' him. Bill Clinton the next night also praised Obama, something that he failed to effectively do in 2000 for Al Gore when he centered on his accomplishments and gave little more than lip service to Gore with statements amounting to 'and Al Gore was there too'. The convention, possibly remembering that, gave him the topic he was to speak on instead of choosing his own. Clinton was angered, but it worked. He came through. By the time Obama spoke on the last night, the theme that was missing at first was clear, and Obama mixed a message of attacking McCain with the need for change and even outlining some expensive programs that would appeal to the target populace who has been lukewarm to him. From a political point of view, the convention did what it was supposed to.

Scandal
Denver officials had constructed a secret jail to house those that would misbehave in the Mile High City when the Democrats attend their convention. The makeshift holding center, dubbed ""Gitmo on the Platte"" by activists, contained barbed wire fencing and signs warning of stun gun use. The Steele Street warehouse was designed to process 60 arrestees per hour.[2]
Ingrid Mattson, president of the Islamic Society of North America, spoke at a prayer service at the convention. Hidden from the public because nobody debated it at the time, the group has ties to funding Hamas terrorists and the facts were well known July 2008. Mattson's group says it does not condone terrorism.  The Holy Land Foundation and five of its former leaders were convicted of funneling millions of dollars to Hamas for which the ISNA funded and supported.[3]
Cnet reported that in the week of the convention, an unusual phenomenon occurred on Craigslist's Denver Web site. Ads soliciting casual sex spiked 80% that week, as tens of thousands of people had arrived for the Democratic convention. Those convention days showed the week-over-week jump in sex ads. Monday increased 77 percent over the average of earlier in the month; Tuesday increased 69 percent; Wednesday's increase was 74 percent. The online solicitations featured such lurid titles as ""Does the DNC make you hot?"" and content far worse than that.[4] No analogous phenomenon was reported during the Republican convention.

Protest

American Right to Life Action, an anti-abortion group, claims to have displayed the largest ever protest sign in history, 530 feet tall and 666 feet wide. The sign says ""Destroys uNborn Children"" [sic], with the words appearing one atop each other to also form the acronym ""DNC."" [5] According to a release from the group, ""thousands of DNC delegates and journalists can look out their hotel windows to the west to see the sign."" ""The tiniest boys and girls should be loved and protected, but as nominating Barack Obama emphasizes, the DNC even supports killing kids in the womb old enough to know their mother's voice, sleep and dream, suck their thumbs, and play with their toes."" The Guinness Book of World Records assigned American Right To Life an official world record attempt number: 228132.

Republican National Convention
Summary
The 2008 Republican National Convention was held in Saint Paul, Minnesota from September 1 (Labor Day) until September 4. The presumptive nominee was Senator McCain. The location has political significance in that Minnesota will likely be a close state during the general election, as will it's neighboring states Wisconsin and Iowa.
The convention schedule had to be altered due to the upcoming landfall of Hurricane Gustav. The first day almost entirely focused on raising money for Hurricane relief.  This led to a shortened three day convention instead of four and there was some shuffling of who was speaking on which day to accommodate the suddenly shortened time span.  In a surprise, George W. Bush was only delivered an eight minute speech by satellite.  In another surprise Sarah Palin's speech was watched by as many people as saw Obama give his acceptance speech on the closing night of the Democratic convention, as over 40 million people tuned in.[6]  She was considered the highlight of the convention, even surpassing John McCain's speech the next day, and was noted for doing an exceptional job.  Recognizing the strong asset that they have in her, the Republicans made reference to her many times on the last day of the convention.  McCain, not known for being comfortable reading prepared speeches in a convention hall, delivered a solid speech.  While Obama continued to enjoy a lead in the polls, it changed quickly thereafter to a slight McCain-Palin edge.  The Republican convention more than canceled out a very powerful Democratic convention.

Convention Schedule
Note:  Due to the hurricane and the effort to use their public forum to raise funds for it, the first night of the Republican convention was not shown.  Adjustments were made throughout to accommodate that loss.

2005 Andijon Uprisings,https://www.conservapedia.com/2005_Andijon_Uprisings,"The 2005 Andijon Uprisings was an uprising and terrorist attack held on May 13, 2005. In the uprising, members of Akromiya, with support from Hizb ut-Tahrir and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan raided a police station, killing several guards and taking a large quantity of military equipment.  Not long afterward the militants raided a prison and freed more than 500 prisoners, including several imprisoned Islamists.  The militants then set fire to the city's main cinema, forcing patrons and nearby residents to run into the main city square.  After civilians fleeing the burning building entered the square, militants members took them as hostages, beating, torturing, and using them as literal human shields by tying them to the perimeter of the city square with wire.  Ill-prepared Uzbek troops fired on the square, but due to their poor training killed an estimated 45 civilians.  The militants filmed themselves throughout the event, showing that they were heavily armed, but were later seen putting down their weapons before fleeing to refugee camps in Kyrgyzstan.  On the video, several men were heard shouting ""Allahu Akbar"", taking hostages (including two human rights activists) and throwing grenades.  In total 176 people were killed; 79 Islamists, 45 civilians, and 31 Uzbekistani soldiers; although some groups claim 187 people were killed.[1][2][3]

Democratic National Convention
Summary
The 2008 Democratic National Convention was held in Denver, Colorado, from August 25 to August 27 at Pepsi Center. There, Senator Obama and his running mate were selected to be the party nominee's. Barack Obama will accepted the party's nomination in front of a crowd of more than 75,000 in a free, open event held at INVESCO Field at Mile High, in a platform resemblant to a Greek temple. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is the Permanent Chair of the Convention.
The convention had a rocky start as friction between supporters of Obama and the Clintons was not resolved.  Instead of Obama getting a bump in the polls, his support actually declined.  The Democrats also seemed to be at odds on finding a unifying strategy for how hard to attack John McCain and how to present it.  As Democratic pundit James Carville said in an interview on CNN, ""If this party has a message, it's done a <heck> of a job hiding it tonight, I promise you that.""[1]
A bleak convention was turned around by the Clintons. Infighting between Obama and Hillary continued through the day of her speech, but a comprise was reached, and, beyond expectations, she gave a rousing speech for Obama - possibly as an angry response to McCain's latest ad that showed her 'supporting' him. Bill Clinton the next night also praised Obama, something that he failed to effectively do in 2000 for Al Gore when he centered on his accomplishments and gave little more than lip service to Gore with statements amounting to 'and Al Gore was there too'. The convention, possibly remembering that, gave him the topic he was to speak on instead of choosing his own. Clinton was angered, but it worked. He came through. By the time Obama spoke on the last night, the theme that was missing at first was clear, and Obama mixed a message of attacking McCain with the need for change and even outlining some expensive programs that would appeal to the target populace who has been lukewarm to him. From a political point of view, the convention did what it was supposed to.

Scandal
Denver officials had constructed a secret jail to house those that would misbehave in the Mile High City when the Democrats attend their convention. The makeshift holding center, dubbed ""Gitmo on the Platte"" by activists, contained barbed wire fencing and signs warning of stun gun use. The Steele Street warehouse was designed to process 60 arrestees per hour.[2]
Ingrid Mattson, president of the Islamic Society of North America, spoke at a prayer service at the convention. Hidden from the public because nobody debated it at the time, the group has ties to funding Hamas terrorists and the facts were well known July 2008. Mattson's group says it does not condone terrorism.  The Holy Land Foundation and five of its former leaders were convicted of funneling millions of dollars to Hamas for which the ISNA funded and supported.[3]
Cnet reported that in the week of the convention, an unusual phenomenon occurred on Craigslist's Denver Web site. Ads soliciting casual sex spiked 80% that week, as tens of thousands of people had arrived for the Democratic convention. Those convention days showed the week-over-week jump in sex ads. Monday increased 77 percent over the average of earlier in the month; Tuesday increased 69 percent; Wednesday's increase was 74 percent. The online solicitations featured such lurid titles as ""Does the DNC make you hot?"" and content far worse than that.[4] No analogous phenomenon was reported during the Republican convention.

Protest

American Right to Life Action, an anti-abortion group, claims to have displayed the largest ever protest sign in history, 530 feet tall and 666 feet wide. The sign says ""Destroys uNborn Children"" [sic], with the words appearing one atop each other to also form the acronym ""DNC."" [5] According to a release from the group, ""thousands of DNC delegates and journalists can look out their hotel windows to the west to see the sign."" ""The tiniest boys and girls should be loved and protected, but as nominating Barack Obama emphasizes, the DNC even supports killing kids in the womb old enough to know their mother's voice, sleep and dream, suck their thumbs, and play with their toes."" The Guinness Book of World Records assigned American Right To Life an official world record attempt number: 228132.

Republican National Convention
Summary
The 2008 Republican National Convention was held in Saint Paul, Minnesota from September 1 (Labor Day) until September 4. The presumptive nominee was Senator McCain. The location has political significance in that Minnesota will likely be a close state during the general election, as will it's neighboring states Wisconsin and Iowa.
The convention schedule had to be altered due to the upcoming landfall of Hurricane Gustav. The first day almost entirely focused on raising money for Hurricane relief.  This led to a shortened three day convention instead of four and there was some shuffling of who was speaking on which day to accommodate the suddenly shortened time span.  In a surprise, George W. Bush was only delivered an eight minute speech by satellite.  In another surprise Sarah Palin's speech was watched by as many people as saw Obama give his acceptance speech on the closing night of the Democratic convention, as over 40 million people tuned in.[6]  She was considered the highlight of the convention, even surpassing John McCain's speech the next day, and was noted for doing an exceptional job.  Recognizing the strong asset that they have in her, the Republicans made reference to her many times on the last day of the convention.  McCain, not known for being comfortable reading prepared speeches in a convention hall, delivered a solid speech.  While Obama continued to enjoy a lead in the polls, it changed quickly thereafter to a slight McCain-Palin edge.  The Republican convention more than canceled out a very powerful Democratic convention.

Convention Schedule
Note:  Due to the hurricane and the effort to use their public forum to raise funds for it, the first night of the Republican convention was not shown.  Adjustments were made throughout to accommodate that loss.

1968 riots,https://www.conservapedia.com/1968_riots,"The May 1968 riots refer to an upsurge of general strikes and leftist-orchestrated rioting among Maoist and Trotskyite groups as well as student radicals in France during this time, being the largest general strike in the history of France, and also the first wildcat strike action to be practiced. It resulted in the economy being ground to a halt due to several of the rioters occupying various Factories around France.
Although treated by various leftist media and scholars as being spontaneous and having the majority, if not all of France's youth participating in the riots or at the very least influenced by them, it was actually a minority rabble of Maoists and Trotskyite groups trying to impose their will on society. Some of their goals also were similar to the Hippie movement in America, including promoting sexual liberation and anarchism, and also protesting American involvement in the Vietnam War. The events were also responsible for Charles de Gaulle being re-elected due to the populace ultimately being disgusted by the violence. Existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre also was involved in the riots, and ended up arrested, although de Gaulle ended up pardoning Sartre largely due to the latter's status as a philosopher, citing that ""one does not arrest Voltaire."" Although the direct starting point for the riots occurred in February of that year when the French Socialists and Communists entered an alliance to force Charles de Gaulle and his administration out of office, there is also evidence that the Situational student movement's protests at the Strasbourg campus of the University of Paris two years earlier had played a role in the creation of the riots. Ironically, the French government would later create the University of Vincennes partially in response to the student radicals' demands during May 1968, only for them to be even more radicalized and protest even further, with such being relegated by the university's philosophy department, of which post-structuralist philosopher and leftist Michel Foucault had been in charge of at the time, with him being one of the few faculty to directly participate in a similar protest that was staged in January of the following year. Foucault never participated in the events of May 1968 in person, largely because at the time they had occurred, he was required to teach at the University of Tunis. However, he nonetheless was kept informed of the constant disorder via his homosexual lover Daniel Defert, who was in Paris at the time, holding a transistor radio to the phone for hours on end that gave reports of the carnage.[1]

Legacy
Although the left has often compared it to the hippies and treated it as a success, even more so than the hippie movement at times, various French citizens felt it was not a good event. In particular, Generation Identitaire, a conservative youth movement in France seeking to restore France's national identity, placed the blame squarely on the participants of May 1968 for France's identity being stolen in their manifesto. In particular, they specifically stated how the participants of the May 1968 riots had professed a desire to liberate themselves from tradition, knowledge, and authority in education, but all they liberated themselves from was their own responsibilities, and how the members of Generation Identitaire represented the generation who felt the aftereffects of those choices.[2]

1

Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:

In the mountains of Ephraim there lived a man of Ramathaim-zophim. His name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an  Ephrathite.




2

And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.

Elkanah had two wives. One was called Ana, and the other, Penina. Penina had children, but Hannah didn’t.




3

And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.

 Each year Elkanah leaved his village to worship the LORD and to offer sacrifices at Shiloh, where Hophni and Phinehas, two sons of Eli, were priests of the LORD.




4

And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:

 When the day came to offer sacrifice, Elkanah used to give their share to Penina and to all his sons and daughters.




5

But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb.

But he gave a special portion to Hannah, because he loved her despite the fact that the LORD made her sterile.




6

And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.

Penina, her rival, used to torment her, since she knew that the LORD made her sterile.




7

And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.

Each year, when they went to the house of the LORD, happened the same story: Penina tormented her until she began to cry, and Hannah did not even wanted to eat.




8

Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?

Then Elkanah,  her husband, used to tell her: ""Hannah, why do you cry? Why don´t you eat? Why are you resentful? Am I not more to you than ten sons? ""




9

So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.

Once, at Shiloh, Hannah, after her meal, went to the sanctuary of the LORD, where priest Eli was sitting in his chair near the door.




10

And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.

With great anguish she began to pray to the Lord and mourn inconsolably




11

And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no rasor come upon his head.

Then made this vow: ""My LORD, if you look at the misery of this servant of yours and, if instead of forgetting me, you remember me and grant me a son, I will offer him to you for his whole life, and he will never cut his hair.""




12

And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth.






13

Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.






14

And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.






15

And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.






16

Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.






17

Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.






18

And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.






19

And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.






20

Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.






21

And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.






22

But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.






23

And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.






24

And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young.






25

And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.






26

And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.






27

For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:






28

Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.

Analysis


1

And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.






2

There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee: neither is there any rock like our God.






3

Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.






4

The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.






5

They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.






6

The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.






7

The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.






8

He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD's, and he hath set the world upon them.






9

He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.






10

The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.






11

And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.






12

Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.






13

And the priests' custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;






14

And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.






15

Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.






16

And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.






17

Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.






18

But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.






19

Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.






20

And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home.






21

And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.






22

Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.






23

And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.






24

Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD's people to transgress.






25

If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.






26

And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.






27

And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?






28

And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?






29

Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?






30

Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.






31

Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.






32

And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.






33

And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.






34

And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.






35

And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.






36

And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.

1

And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.






2

And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;






3

And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;






4

That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.






5

And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.






6

And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.






7

Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.






8

And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.






9

Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.






10

And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.






11

And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.






12

In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.






13

For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.






14

And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.






15

And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.






16

Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I.






17

And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.






18

And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.






19

And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.






20

And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD.






21

And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.

1

And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Eben-ezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.






2

And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.






3

And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.






4

So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth between the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.






5

And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.






6

And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp.






7

And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.






8

Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.






9

Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.






10

And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.






11

And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.






12

And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.






13

And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.






14

And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.






15

Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see.






16

And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son?






17

And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.






18

And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.






19

And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.






20

And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it.






21

And she named the child I-chabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband.






22

And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken.

And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Eben-ezer unto Ashdod.






2

When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.






3

And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.






4

And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him.






5

Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day.






6

But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the coasts thereof.






7

And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god.






8

They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thither.






9

And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.






10

Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.






11

So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.






12

And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to heaven.

And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.






2

And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place.






3

And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.






4

Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.






5

Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.






6

Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?






7

Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them:






8

And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespass offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go.






9

And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Beth-shemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that is not his hand that smote us; it was a chance that happened to us.






10

And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:






11

And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods.






12

And the kine took the straight way to the way of Beth-shemesh, and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Beth-shemesh.






13

And they of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.






14

And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Beth-shemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the LORD.






15

And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD.






16

And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.






17

And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;






18

And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of country villages, even unto the great stone of Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the LORD: which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua, the Beth-shemite.






19

And he smote the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter.

And the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us?

And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh.






7

And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.






8

And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.

And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.

And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.






8

According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.

Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.

And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.

1964 Civil Rights Act,https://www.conservapedia.com/1964_Civil_Rights_Act," President Lyndon B. Johnson signs the Civil Rights Act of 1964, July 2, 1964
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a landmark in legislative attempts to improve the quality of life for African Americans and other minority groups. Although civil rights had a long history as a political and legislative issue, the 1960s marked a period of intense activity by the federal government to protect minority rights. The Act did not resolve all problems of discrimination. But it opened the door to further progress by lessening racial restrictions on the use of public facilities, providing more job opportunities, strengthening voting laws, and limiting federal funding of discriminatory aid programs.  The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed by Congress based on the Commerce Clause, not the 14th Amendment, in order to apply to private (non-state) actors such as small restaurants.
The story of the 1964 Civil Rights Act is interesting and instructive because it illustrates how an historically important piece of legislation became part of our nation's heritage. Democrats attempted to block the passage of the Act by filibustering for 75 hours, including a 14-hour and 13 minute address by Senator Robert Byrd.[1] An examination of the Act also provides a way to understand the climate of opinion regarding African American rights, the nature of civil rights activity, the obstacles to political and social change, the role of politics in the way issues are handled, the actions of individual senators and representatives, and the nature of legislative activity in general. The intricate process that makes a bill become law is a combination of all these factors.


The ""Civil Rights Act of 1964"" pushed to make the Declaration of Independence's inalienable rights of ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" a reality for all Americans.



The Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned discrimination in public accommodations, employment and federally funded activities like education, would not have passed without the support of House and Senate Republicans who were competing for black votes. And Presidents Kennedy and Johnson would not have advocated for the bill without being pressured to do so by a multiracial grass-roots movement. [1]

  


 “


This nation was founded on the principle that all men are created equal, and that the rights of every man are diminished when the rights of one man are threatened. ... It ought to be possible, in short, for every American to enjoy the privileges of being American without regard to his race or his color. In short, every American ought to have the right to be treated as he would wish to be treated, as one would wish his children to be treated. But this is not the case. ... We are confronted primarily with a moral issue. It is as old as the scriptures and is as clear as the American Constitution. ... One hundred years of delay have passed since President Lincoln freed the slaves, yet their heirs, their grandsons, are not fully free. ... And this nation, for all its boasts, will not be fully free until all its citizens are free. — President Kennedy.

Civil Rights Act and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
In the 1960s, Americans who knew only the potential of ""equal protection of the laws"" expected the President, the Congress, and the courts to fulfill the promise of the 14th Amendment. In response, all three branches of the federal government—as well as the public at large—debated a fundamental constitutional question: Does the Constitution's prohibition of denying equal protection always ban the use of racial, ethnic, or gender criteria in an attempt to bring social justice and social benefits?


In 1964 Congress passed Public Law 82-352 (78 Stat. 241). The provisions of this civil rights act forbade discrimination on the basis of sex as well as race in hiring, promoting, and firing. The word ""sex"" was added at the last moment. According to the West Encyclopedia of American Law, Representative Howard W. Smith (D-VA) added the word. His critics argued that Smith, a conservative Southern opponent of federal civil rights, did so to kill the entire bill. Smith, however, argued that he had amended the bill in keeping with his support of Alice Paul and the National Women's Party with whom he had been working. Martha W. Griffiths (D-MI) led the effort to keep the word ""sex"" in the bill. In the final legislation, Section 703 (a) made it unlawful for an employer to ""fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions or privileges or employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin."" The final bill also allowed sex to be a consideration when sex is a bona fide occupational qualification for the job. Title VII of the act created the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to implement the law.
Subsequent legislation expanded the role of the EEOC. Today, according to the U. S. Government Manual of 1998-99, the EEOC enforces laws that prohibit discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, or age in hiring, promoting, firing, setting wages, testing, training, apprenticeship, and all other terms and conditions of employment. Race, color, sex, creed, and age are now protected classes. The proposal to add each group to protected-class status unleashed furious debate. But no words stimulate the passion of the debate more than ""affirmative action.""
As West defines the term, affirmative action ""refers to both mandatory and voluntary programs intended to affirm the civil rights of designated classes of individuals by taking positive action to protect them"" from discrimination. The issue for most Americans is fairness: Should the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment be used to advance the liberty of one class of individuals for good reasons when that action may infringe on the liberty of another?
The EEOC, as an independent regulatory body, plays a major role in dealing with this issue. Since its creation in 1964, Congress has gradually extended EEOC powers to include investigatory authority, creating conciliation programs, filing lawsuits, and conducting voluntary assistance programs. While the Civil Rights Act of 1964 did not mention the words affirmative action, it did authorize the bureaucracy to makes rules to help end discrimination. The EEOC has done so.
Today the regulatory authority of the EEOC includes enforcing a range of federal statutes prohibiting employment discrimination. According to the EEOC's own Web site, these include Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, and its amendments, that prohibits employment discrimination against individuals 40 years of age or older; the Equal Pay Act of 1963 that prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender in compensation for substantially similar work under similar conditions; Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 that prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of disability in both the public and private sector, excluding the federal government; the Civil Rights Act of 1991 that provides for monetary damages in case of intentional discrimination; and Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, that prohibits employment discrimination against federal employees with disabilities. Title IX of the Education Act of 1972 forbade gender discrimination in education programs, including athletics that received federal dollars. In the late 1970s Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. This made it illegal for employers to exclude pregnancy and childbirth from their sick leave and health benefits plans.
Presidents also weighed in, employing a series of executive orders. President Lyndon B. Johnson ordered all executive agencies to require federal contractors to ""take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, or national origin."" This marked the first use of the phrase ""affirmative action."" In 1969 an executive order required that every level of federal service offer equal opportunities for women and established a program to implement that action. President Richard Nixon's Department of Labor adopted a plan requiring federal contractors to assess their employees to identify gender and race and to set goals to end any under-representation of women and minorities. By the 1990s Democratic and Republican administrations had taken a variety of actions that resulted in 160 different affirmative action federal programs. State and local governments were following suit.
The courts also addressed affirmative action. In addition to dealing with race, color, creed, and age, from the 1970s forward, the court dealt with gender questions. It voided arbitrary weight and height requirements (Dothard v. Rawlinson), erased mandatory pregnancy leaves (Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur), allowed public employers to use carefully constructed affirmative action plans to remedy specific past discrimination that resulted in women and minorities being under-represented in the workplace (Johnson v. Transportation Agency, Santa Clara County), and upheld state and local laws prohibiting gender discrimination.
By the late 1970s all branches of the federal government and most state governments had taken at least some action to fulfill the promise of equal protection under the law. The EEOC served as the agent of implementation and complaint. Its activism divided liberals and conservatives, illuminating their differing views about the proper scope of government. In general, the political liberals embraced the creation of the EEOC as the birth of a federal regulatory authority that could promote the goal of equality by designing policies to help the historically disadvantaged, including women and minorities. In contrast, political conservatives saw the EEOC as a violation of their belief in fewer government regulations and fewer federal policies. To them, creating a strong economy, free from government intervention, would produce gains that would benefit the historically disadvantaged. Even the nonideological segment of the American population asked: What should government do, if anything, to ensure equal protection under the law?
In fiscal year 1997, the EEOC collected $111 million in financial benefits for people who filed claims of discrimination. Its recent successful efforts include a $34 million settlement in a sexual harassment case with Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing of America, resulting in the company's adoption of changes to its sexual harassment prevention policy. Working with state and local programs, the EEOC processes 48,000 claims annually.[2]

The Campaign
Republicans pointed out that Kerry was liberal, even more so than Ted Kennedy.  Bush's popularity numbers were at a point that most Presidents would not get re-elected.  Indeed, Kerry led in the polls for most of the campaign season, but failed to get a bump from the Democratic convention, especially when confronted with strong allegations from Swift Boat veterans that his war record was exaggerated and far from heroic.  The Republican convention painted Kerry as a flip-flopper, and the Bush-Cheney ticket did receive a bounce.  Even so, with a campaign to galvanize the young people to his cause with odd slogans such as ""vote or die"", Kerry still had a slight lead heading into the election and it appeared he would win.

The Election
On election night, voter turnout was heavy, as the Democrats had hoped, but they underestimated the Republican turnout - which was heavier than expected.  Karl Rove's strategy of getting gay marriage amendment propositions on the ballot in key states helped to get out the conservative base.  Exit polling was known to be unreliable as more Democrats than Republicans agree to talk afterwards, but this election truly highlighted that.  It began to leak on the internet that Kerry had won as the polling showed that he won Ohio by 5 points.  The networks believed that Kerry was going to be the next President and all they had to do was report it as it unfolded.  In the end George W. Bush won.  At first Kerry and Edwards refused to concede and, indeed, Edwards wanted to contest the election, but there were no close states like in 2000.  Their best bet, Ohio, was won by Bush with a margin of 120,000 votes.  Kerry conceded the next morning and Bush was re-elected as President.         
In a rare occurrence, it was found afterwards that Kerry hadn't spent all of the money in his war chest, having over $10 million that could have gone to last minute advertising.  The Democratic party was upset and Kerry never did explain why he allowed this to occur.
Due to the high voter turnout and lack of a strong third party candidate, George Bush's tally of over 62 million votes was the most in United States History and surpassed his winning total in 2000 by over 11 million votes.  John Kerry's 59 million was the second highest for a Presidential candidate, and, of course, the highest for a losing candidate. The relative closeness of the victory was due in part to lopsided Democrat victories in New York and California; ignoring these states, Bush beat Kerry by 5 1/2 percentage points in the remaining 48 states.
After the election, there were a number of allegations of voter fraud and irregularities by those who couldn't face that their candidate lost,[1][2][3][4] and some Democratic poll workers were convicted of misconduct and failure to perform official duties in a vote rigging scheme to bypass a recount of Presidential election ballots.,[5][6] but in the end it meant little to the overall scheme of how the election went.
Adding to a disappointing presidential election for the Democratic party, one of Minnesota's electoral college members inexplicably cast his vote for John Edwards instead of Kerry. New York also made a mistake and gave their electoral votes to ""John L. Kerry"" instead of John F. Kerry.  The state electors gave a corrected set of results to the Senate.

2012 Olympic Games,https://www.conservapedia.com/2012_Olympic_Games,"The 2012 Summer Olympic Games, officially known as the Games of the XXX Olympiad and informally as London 2012, took place in London from July 27 through August 12.[1] During the Modern Olympic Games, the pagan origins of the Olympics have been replaced by faith-based achievement by the participating athletes.

Political Questions Resolved by the Games
Athletes from 204 National Olympic Committees participated.[2]  Sports contests having the greatest political interest are (note especially the growing list of lack of public schools for the gold medalists below):

How many athletes will do the equivalent of Tebowing after a victory?  American Meb Keflezighi, who won the silver medal in the marathon in 2004, typically gives glory to God with the sign of the Cross after finishing a race.[3]

Missy Franklin, who won three gold medals at the 2012 games, thanked God as one of her first comments after winning.
Lauren Cheney and at least four other members of the women's soccer team are devout Christians who participate in Bible studies and worshiped together in church services.[4]
American Allyson Felix, whose three gold medals (200m, 4 × 100 m and 4 × 400 m relay) were the most by a female track star in nearly 25 years, has said ""I feel so blessed that God has given me the talent of running. My running is an amazing gift from God, and I want to use it to the best of my ability to glorify Him. For me, my faith is the reason I run. ... My goal is to be more Christ-like every single day, and that is not an easy task.""[5]
The first American medalist (silver) in the 10k since 1964, Galen Rupp, reportedly has a strong Catholic faith and attended Catholic high school.Dawn Harper, gold medalist in 2008 and silver medalist in 2012 in the 100m hurdles, said ""My faith was definitely a part of me growing up. ... I knew that God was real in my life.""[4]
The first gold medalist for Ireland since 1996, boxer Katie Taylor said after winning: ""I serve an amazing God and without Him I wouldn't be here without this gold medal around my neck."" Her boxing robe contained the verse, ""The Lord is my shepherd and my shield.""[6]
After winning the all-around women's gymnastic title, Gabby Douglas tweeted, ""Let all that I am praise the LORD; may I never forget the good things he does for me.""
Bernard Lagat, a medalist at prior Olympics, did the Sign of the Cross just before he was introduced to the crowd for the 5k race.  He then ""finished fourth after being clipped from behind in the final 200 meters,"" but showed tremendous sportsmanship, praised the winner, and gave thanks afterward as ""the most blessed person during my career.""[7] Indeed, at least three out of the eight athletes running in the 5k finals did the Sign of the Cross shortly before being introduced for the race, and a fourth runner is known to be a devout Catholic.
Ethiopian Tiki Gelana remarkably overcame a mid-race fall to win the women's marathon, after thinking ""thank God"" at the beginning of the race for the rain because she grew up running in rainy weather - but the lamestream media reported her quote with a small ""g"" for ""God"".[8]
Double-amputee runner Oscar Pistorius noted that he thanks God ""Because He is the reason for my success and the one that takes me from strength to strength.""[6]
The winner of both the 10,000 and 5,000 metres races, Mohamed Farah, bowed towards Mecca to give thanks to Allah after both his victories.



Multiple

Will almost no athletes from public school sports programs win any gold medals, despite how public schools spend more than $500 billion annually to teach and train Americans?

The lamestream media state that Missy Franklin, the star swimmer, is a high school student, but fail to mention that she attends Catholic school rather than public school.
American 2012 Olympic gold medal winners (incomplete)

Private: Missy Franklin (Catholic high school),[9] Katie Ledecky (Catholic high school); triple-gold medalist Allyson Felix was a graduate of Los Angeles Baptist High School
Homeschooled: Gabby Douglas, McKayla Maroney
College or adult: Michael Phelps,[10] Dana Vollmer, Vincent Hancock, Conor Dwyer, Kristin Armstrong, Nathan Adrian, Allison Schmitt, Shannon Vreeland, Kim Rhode, Ryan Lochte, Matt Grevers, Aly Raisman, Ricky Berens, Jamie Lynn Gray, Bob Bryan, Mike Bryan, Serena Williams, all members of the women's soccer, women's water polo, women's basketball, and men's basketball teams
Public school: Kyla Ross and Jordyn Wieber won a group gold medal as part of the team led by homeschooled Gabby Douglas


Multiple

How many athletes will be unfairly expelled based on liberal censorship of their free speech?

One athlete—Greek triple-jumper Voula Papachristou—was expelled from the Greek National team by her own country's Olympic committee before it officially opened based on a one-sentence joke about immigration, even though she apologized. The joke in question was this from her Twitter: ""With so many Africans in Greece, the West Nile mosquitoes will be getting home food!!!"" It should be noted that Papachristou apologized for the tweet.
In addition to the Greek Olympic Committee's decision on Papachristou, the IOC's own twitter-use policy has been criticized for hindering free speech. The policy, which is claimed to protect the IOC's commercial rights, goes as far as to prevent athletes from ""reporting on events"". According to The Globe and Mail, even a tweet such as ""Won our games against China, USA. Next up, the Brazilians,"" could get an athlete expelled from the Games without notice. As of yet, no athletes have been expelled by the IOC for this social media censorship policy. 
Lolo Jones, a pro-abstinence American hurdler, is being criticized by the lamestream media for sending out a pro-Second Amendment tweet.
The liberal thought police expelled a Swiss soccer player for tweeting that South Koreans are ""retards.""[11]



Opening Ceremonies

Will Overrated Sports Star David Beckham be selected to light the Olympic cauldron?

Beckham was not selected as the final torchbearer. He was, however, a passenger on the speedboat that carried the torch up the River Thames. He assisted in the hand-off of the torch to Sir Steve Redgrave, one of Britain's greatest Olympians. Sebastian Coe, chairman of London 2012, stated, ""He [Beckham] will be more than an ambassador given what he has done, the commitment he has given and the amount of time he has spent with us in London on this project. He was not only alongside us when we won [the right to host the Olympics], he was alongside us when we threw our hats in the ring.""[12]


Multiple

will atheist nations underachieve in team sports?

Yes.  The performance by Great Britain's teams was abysmal.  They were eliminated in the quarterfinals in soccer, the national sport.  They did not even make the tournament round in men's basketball, after going 1-5 in the qualifying matches.  In men's volleyball, Great Britain's team lost every single match and was eliminated.
Increasingly atheistic Australia underachieved in team sports also.  It failed to qualify for men's or women's soccer. In men's soccer, they finished last in their four-team qualifying group, competing against three mediocre teams: United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, and Iraq (Australia competes in soccer competitions against Asian teams, not Oceanic teams, unlike in most other team sports). The women did slightly better in qualifying, finishing third behind Japan and North Korea, but also failed to qualify. This is the first Olympics since 1976 where the Australian men did not compete - however the competition, while still weak, is much tougher than the competition in the Oceanic Zone they faced until 2004. Still, Australia was the best team in their men's qualifying group and should not have finished last. 
In women's basketball, France won Group B with a 5-0 record, while Australia finished 4-1 in the same group. Great Britain is 0-5. France and Australia won their quarterfinals. France will face Russia in the semifinals while Australia will face the United States.
In women's handball, Great Britain finished 0-5-0 and France is 4-0-1 (W-L-D). France lost to Montenegro the quarterfinals. Handball is almost unknown in GB, with only a dozen or so clubs, in stark contrast to most other countries in Western Europe.
In basketball, Australia finished 3-2, fourth in their group, and lost to the USA in the quarterfinals. France finished 4-1 and will face Spain in the quarterfinals. Basketball is a minor sport in GB, much less played than in continental Europe, and GB would have considered themselves lucky if they had won a match.
In men's volleyball, Australia finished 2-3 and was eliminated in the group stage.



Multiple

Similarly, will atheist nations underachieve in general?

China, an officially atheist and communist country, led in gold medals in the first week but then dropped badly to a distant second place behind the United States, despite China having more than three times the population of the United States and despite having a national program designed to produce champion athletes.  Increasingly atheistic Australia performed much worse than expectations.  Australia won 35 medals, but only 7 gold medals. France has 34 medals, of which 11 are gold. In 2008, Australia won 46 medals and France won 41. Australia won 14 golds that year, a total that they failed to surpass. ""Atheistic"" Great Britain, on the other hand, had its best Olympic showing since the 1908 Olympic Games (where Team GB had over half of the athletes in competition), although this is possibly because they were the hosts (as they were in 1908 and 1948). Even excluding Britain (which may or may not be accurate), the data is inconclusive as there is a 1/4 chance (25%) that two randomly selected countries would underperform by pure chance. 2016 will provide additional data to analyze, and it may be possible to reach a conclusion. Furthermore, any analysis including Great Britain in these Games is problematic, because hosts typically experience about a 30% medal boost.


wrestling

have feminist Title IX quotas destroyed the U.S. team?

The U.S. men's wrestling team won only three medals - less than half that won by much-smaller and less prosperous Iran, and only a fraction of the medals won by Russian, despite the U.S. winning far more medals overall than both nations.
Men's track has also been ravaged by feminist Title IX quotas, and Team USA won only one bronze medal out of 12 medals in the marquee events of the men's 100m, 200m, 400m, and 800m events—which the U.S. previously dominated.
A majority of medals won by Team USA were won by women, but many of those were in sports unhelped by Title IX, such as women's gymnastics, swimming, tennis, and beach volleyball.



men's basketball

will selfless play by outspoken Christian Kevin Durant overcome ball-hogging by Overrated Sports Stars Kobe Bryant and LeBron James on USA Basketball?

Outspoken Christian Kevin Durant set an all-time Olympic record of 147 points, including a game-high of 30 points in the tight final game, while the media-promoted players did not do as well.


women's soccer

ranked #1 and won the gold in the last two Olympics, most recently with a foreign coach. Now that this U.S. team is politically correct, will it underachieve?[13]  Major rivals will be Japan, Brazil and France.

The U.S. women's team advanced to the finals only because of a foul that is almost never called in a big game: holding the ball too long by the Canadian goalie.[14]  In the finals the women's team then won the gold by a margin of only one goal against an underfunded team from Japan that had to fly to the Olympics in economy class.


Joke sports

Will underperforming countries pad their medal totals by excelling in many varieties of swimming and in non-serious sports like badminton and dressage?

Several nations were able to obscure their underachievement in real sports and pad their medal totals by winning joke sport events of dubious value, such as table tennis (atheistic China won all 4 gold medals),[15] swimming relays (there is no baton passed in a swimming relay), equestrian (Great Britain racked up five medals in this), [add more], synchronized swimming (China won two of the six medals awarded), and synchronized diving (where China won all four gold medals).


men's tennis

will one of the Greatest Conservative Sports Stars—such as Novak Djokovic—win the gold medal? Will Andy Murray of atheistic Britain underperform?

Both players advanced to the semifinals, where Murray defeated Djokovic in straight sets. Murray defeated Roger Federer of Switzerland for the gold in straight sets, while Djokovic underperformed and lost to Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina in the bronze medal match.  Murray then went on to play in mixed doubles match that same day and medalled silver with Laura Robson, losing to the heavily favoured Mirnyi and Azarenka.


8-month pregnant athlete

Will the lamestream media report on Nur Suryani Mohamed Taibi of Malaysia, who is competing while being 8 months pregnant, or does that send too pro-life of a message?

Taibi was eliminated from the Olympics on the first day of official competition after finishing in 34th place. Few articles mentioned her prior to her elimination; there was more publicity about her after her defeat.[16][17][18][19] The New York Times ran an article on the athlete on 16 July 2012,[20] The Guardian [21] and ESPN [22] both reported on her results in the competition.


Gun events

Will the lamestream media downplay the gun events because they want to continue to push gun control?

Great Britain shooter Peter Wilson's gold medal success in the double-trap clay pigeon event was widely reported and celebrated in the British media, despite Britain being strong in favor of gun control. The victory of Chinese air rifle shooter Yi Siling in winning the first gold medal of the games was reported in most GB media.[23] Coverage is similar to other sports with modest national following. See the entry above on the Malaysian shooter for an exception to this lack of coverage.


Openly homosexual athletes

Will the liberal media overpromote homosexual athletes, far beyond their achievements?

Several months before the games, Sports Illustrated ran a feature article entitled ""The Transgender Athlete"", which included significant overage of a transgender female-to-male shotputter attempting to qualify for the United States women's Olympic team. However, she failed to qualify at the US Olympic Trials, and as such did not receive any coverage during the actual Olympics.


Multiple

Will countries that have implemented same-sex marriage underperform? (See below for a more lengthy explanation)

The total number of medals decreased:[24]
 Belgium - 5 in 2000, 3 in 2012
 Canada - 14 in 2004/2008,[25] 18 in 2012
 Denmark - 7 in 2008, 9 in 2012
 Netherlands - 25 in 2000, 20 in 2012
 Norway - 6 in 2004, 4 in 2012
 Spain - 19 in 2004, 17 in 2012
 Total - 76 expected, 71 actual - decline by more than 6%[26]


Men's Handball

Will underdogs Tunisia overperform in Group A? Group A should perhaps be dubbed the ""Group of Left"", as the other five teams are Sweden, Iceland, and Argentina, where same-sex marriage is legal, and increasingly atheistic Great Britain and France.

Tunisia went 2-3 in the group stage, becoming the second African team ever to advance to the quarterfinals. They then lost to Croatia, the winner of Group B in the quarter finals.
It should be noted that they finished 8th ranked in the twelve team tournament, beating the Great Britain squad that was only formed for the Olympics and then disbanded, and the Argentine team, who qualified for the first time in 2012. So their performance could be viewed as living up to their expectations in some quarters.



2012 Olympics - Sports performance: Religious faith vs. atheism
See also: Sports performance: Religious faith vs. atheism 
The Sports Journal is a monthly refereed journal published by the United States Sports Academy. 
A journal article appeared in the Sports Journal entitled Strength of Religious Faith of Athletes and Nonathletes at Two NCAA Division III Institutions. The article was submitted by Nathan T. Bell, Scott R. Johnson, and Jeffrey C. Petersen from Ball State University.[27]
An excerpt from the abstract of the journal article Strength of Religious Faith of Athletes and Nonathletes at Two NCAA Division III Institutions declares:



 “

 Numerous studies report athletes to be more religious than nonathletes (Fischer, 1997; Storch, Kolsky, Silvestri, & Storch, 2001; Storch et al., 2004). According to Storch, Kolsky, Silvestri, and Storch (2001), four reasons may explain why religion interacts with athletic performance. First, athletes may identify with religious beliefs for direction and humility. Second, athletes may turn to religion to gain a sense of optimism and security, benefiting from such beliefs following a disappointing athletic performance. Third, religion can be used for emotional and psychological support in stressful circumstances like the uncertainty of athletic competition, which can cause athletes an overwhelming amount of anxiety. Religious beliefs can offer the internal strength to persevere through the stress. Fourth, religion “provides a cognitive framework conducive to the relief of anxiety associated with competition” (Storch et al., 2001, p. 347). This framework allows relief from fear and anxiety on the basis of the athlete’s understanding (i.e., belief) that a supreme being is in complete control of the situation. For example, athletes may rely on religious faith to place a poor athletic performance in perspective...
Religion can be an important aspect in athletes’ lives and may serve a protective function against psychological distress and maladaptive behaviors such as substance use or aggression (Storch, Roberti, Bravata, & Storch, 2004). Viewers of sporting events can frequently observe athletes pointing to the sky, engaging in team prayer on the court or field, and glorifying God following athletic competitions.[27]


 ”


This distinction became apparent as a number of Christian athletes have thanked God for their 2012 Olympic medals (see above). No Olympic athlete at the 2012 Olympic games has credited atheism with providing them enhanced sport performance.

Underachievement by nations allowing same sex marriage will be particularly evident.[29]

Nations that are increasingly atheistic
Sweden 1G, 4S, 3B - 1 per 890,806 (per capita)
Norway 2G, 1S, 1B - 1 per 1,298,980
Finland 0G, 2S, 1B - 1 per 5,482,013
Denmark 2G, 4S, 3B - 1 per 374,400
Netherlands 6G, 6S, 8B - 1 per 895,395
Britain 29G, 17S, 19B - 1 per 972,212
France 11G, 11S, 12B - 1 per 1,590,675
Australia 8G, 15S, 12B - 1 per 820,040
[30]

New Zealand 6G, 2S, 5B - 1 per 255,316
Canada 1G, 6S, 11B - 1 per 1,629,626
USA 46G, 28S, 29B - 1 per 2,656,353
The USA won the highest number of medals demonstrating that belief in sport is linked to faith.
Underachievement by atheistic nations will be particularly evident in the team sports, where spiritual motivation is usually non-existent.  Expect the atheistic nations to underachieve most notably in soccer, where teamwork is paramount. Strongly Christian Mexico and Brazil won Gold and Silver in the mens soccer finals whilst the United States, Spain and Russia won Gold, Silver and Bronze respectively in the Basketball demosntrating the how a belief and shared faith can make teams perform to the highest standards.
Also, since Great Britain is the host nation, it may receive a boost in performance in spite of its increasingly atheistic nature. One should be careful to account for this when comparing Britain's performance this year to that in previous Olympic Games. The real reason Britain performed so well in 2008, 2012 amd 2017 was due to the huge liberal money that was poured into the sports agenda to bring Britain prestige even as it declines economically and moves into a dark era with atheism growing and faith declining.

Expected Medals
Many factors contribute to a country's success in the Olympics (e.g., population, proximity to host country, culture), and Gross Domestic Product cannot be used as a fair proxy, due to low (per capita) GDP China comfortably coming first in the 2008 Olympics and Russia ranking third. Below is how the Olympic medals would be awarded if each country earned medals in proportion to their GDP, which vastly overestimates the United States' performance.

Commemoration
The 2012 games mark the 40th anniversary of 11 Israeli Olympic team members taken hostage and killed by Palestinian terrorist group Black September. The Internal Olympic Committee has been urged to offer a commemorative moment of silence for the athletes at the opening ceremony. The IOC has rejected the moment of silence or any mention of the tragic event so as not to upset Muslim countries.[31] Sportscaster Bob Costas says NBC will honor the Munich 11 despite IOC’s refusal to allow it.[32]
There were reports in the media that NBC had cut out a portion of the opening ceremony memorializing the London subway bombing victims. However, according to ceremony director Danny Boyle, the portion was intended as a tribute to his late father, who would have celebrated his birthday that day had he still been alive. Although pictures of victims were displayed, it was not intended to commemorate the victims specifically.[33]

NBC Coverage
Scorn for Comcast's NBC coverage of the Olympic games hit America coast to coast. Viewers took to the internet with the trend #NBCfail During the event. The groans began at the opening ceremony when American viewers were denied the tribute to British victims of Islamic terrorism. However, Sports Illustrated later reported that ceremony director Danny Boyle had intended the tribute in memory of his father, whose birthday would have been that night, and that it was not specifically for the 7/7 victims. While pictures of some of the victims were displayed on the video board, in Boyle's mind, it had ""nothing to do with 7/7"".[33]
As the games moved forward, live events were interrupted or had already finished, replaced with commercials and NBC commentators talking about the athletes. It has been reported the Comcast spent $1 billion for the rights to televise the 2012 Olympics.

↑ Although part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Aruba competes separately at the Olympic Games. Same-sex marriage is not legal in Aruba, although marriages performed in the European mainland Netherlands are recognized per the Kingdom's requirements. Additionally, the territories of Curacao and Sint Maarten, who competed as ""Independent Olympic Athletes"" under the Olympic Flag following the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles and the loss of recognition of their Olympic Committee, have the same regulations as Aruba with regards to same-sex marriage. Since citizens of these territories are also Dutch citizens, they are also eligible to compete for Team Netherlands. Therefore, they may have won some of the Dutch medals. In all three territories, the population is heavily Catholic and there is large opposition to same-sex marriage in spite of the Kingdom's requirements. When Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba opted to integrate fully with the Netherlands as part of the dissolution, the Dutch House of Representatives passed a law that will make same sex-marriage legal in those territories effective in October 2012. However, this law was very strongly opposed by locals and should not be seen as a reflection of popular opinion. Athletes from those three territories were permitted to compete as Independent Olympic Athletes as well. However, of the four IOAs at the Olympics, three are from Curacao and one is a marathoner from South Sudan, which does not yet have a national Olympic Committee. Neither Aruba nor the Independent Olympic Athletes won any medals.

↑ In the United States, 6 out of 50 states permit same-sex marriage (Washington, D.C. also permits same-sex marriage), and 8 additional states permit civil unions.  Two states (including Washington, which had previously recognized civil unions) have declared same-sex marriage legal, but implementation is postponed until after voter referendums on the laws in November 2012. Additionally, in Mexico, same-sex marriage is legal in Mexico City, a federal district roughly equivalent to Washington, DC, as well as in the state of Quintana Roo.

1996 Presidential Election,https://www.conservapedia.com/1996_Presidential_Election," Bob Dole and Bill Clinton The presidential election of 1996 was a victory for the Democratic candidate, incumbent President Bill Clinton. The Republicans nominated Senator Bob Dole as their candidate.  Wealthy businessman H. Ross Perot ran again on the Reform Party ticket. Dole debated President Clinton in two debates, while Perot wasn't allowed to attend as his polling numbers had dropped since 1992.[1]

Issues
In 1994, Republicans won control of both houses of Congress after extracting huge gains in both chambers, but that actually hurt their chances of retaking the White House.  Clinton's failed 1993 health care reform package, which helped lead to the 1994 Republican congressional majority, was too distant in voter's minds.  
Public confidence in the Clinton administration's treatment of China, Iraq, Bosnia, and Israel during 1993-96, evidenced by polls, made the incumbent virtually immune to foreign policy attacks from the Republican Party. Combined with the strong economy overseen by the Republican Congress that Clinton took credit for and the fact that there were no current major foreign policy issues, there was little to run on to oppose him.  
Clinton enjoyed a relatively easy victory in November and became the first Democratic President to be elected to two terms in office since Franklin Roosevelt in 1936.  The public showed little interest in the scandals the Clinton administration was responsible for, such as Whitewater and Travelgate.  He ran on a moderate platform of welfare reform and smaller government, similar to the way he portrayed himself as a moderate in the 1992 election.  The disastrous path of his first two years was forgotten.[2]
Bob Dole promised a 15 percent tax cut, but with a healthy economy that was not a high priority for voters. The press made an issue out of Dole's age and accused him of being 'mean'. Dole, a World War II veteran who had permanent battle injuries, was reluctant to play off of his war record.  Bill Clinton, of course, had avoided military service.  President Clinton was re-elected with a majority of the Electoral College votes but only received a plurality of the popular vote, similar to his 1992 election. The election is notable for having the lowest percentage of voter turnout (49.1%) since 1924.

American Dream
The theme of the Republican convention was 'Restoring the American Dream,' and convention speeches were filled with American Dream imagery. Dole's own speech stressed individualism over collectivism and called for a broad, even multicultural, interpretation of the American Dream. In their acceptance speeches, Democrats have traditionally focused on the importance of community and society while Republicans have increasingly emphasized individual struggle. In 1996, the nomination acceptance speeches of Dole's opponents, Clinton and particularly Perot, borrowed from the Republican vision of individualism and personal responsibility which first gained popularity with the Ronald Reagan presidency of the 1980s. The persistence of American Dream imagery in the speeches of party nominees since the 1960s shows the confidence politicians place in its appeal. The presidential candidates who have best articulated the country's visions and values have been victorious.[3]
Dole proposed a middle class tax cut at the convention, but the news was obscured by mainstream media reports, sympathetic Clinton, that life had been discovered on Mars.[4] The reports of this ""scientific discovery"" persisted for days. Later it was revealed to be another mainstream media fake news hoax.[5]

Voters
Analysis of polling data shows that the economy was the dominant factor in accounting for voter decisions in 1992, and Clinton, not Perot, was the beneficiary of economic discontent. While issues (mainly abortion) and ideology did play some role, Clinton was not perceived by the electorate as a New Democrat. There was little support for the hypothesis of angry voting. Perot took more votes from Bush than from Clinton.[6]
Hispanic voters were energized by four ""wedge"" issues that emerged—immigration reform, welfare reform, affirmative action, English as an official language - and by the antagonistic positions taken by Republicans toward Hispanics on those issues alienated Hispanics from the GOP. Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole sacrificed the already tenuous appeal of the GOP toward Hispanics by embracing an anti-Hispanic position in an effort to appeal to WASP voters. In the end, the Dole strategy failed due to his inability to gain the support of white women. In the meantime, 72% of Hispanics voted for Democrat Bill Clinton, the highest percentage ever. The article provides a detailed record of the Hispanic vote in nine key states and the effect which the higher-than-ever turnout and preference for the Democrat had on each of them. In four of the states, including California, Hispanics were a key component of the Clinton victory margin. In Florida and Arizona, Hispanics helped steer those states from the Republican to the Democratic column. In Texas and Colorado, Hispanic support for Clinton contributed to the close election, even though Clinton lost. In New Mexico, the Hispanic vote was pivotal to the Clinton victory.[7]

.exe,https://www.conservapedia.com/.exe,"An Executable File is a computer file which contains operational directions for a computer.  These directions (which are the binary result of compiled program language) directly instruct the operating system and hardware to perform certain tasks.  Executable files are very common—every computer program is at least in part an executable file.  Many complete programs include other files which contain various resources, configuration, and other data, but there always must be an executable program.

Where are they?
Executable programs come in many different forms.  A program installer is itself an executable file, which loads the desired executable along with other resources into the operating system.  Executable files are also required to open non-executable files.  Documents, for example, are opened by a word processor, such as Open Office's Writer, or Microsoft Word.  There are also heavily integrated into the system.  If one wishes to use the Windows system's calculator, they must run the calc.exe (probabably using the shortcut in the Start menu).  If one wishes to view or open files on their desktop, they unwittingly use the executable program explorer.exe (which starts when the system initializes) to find their file before they use another program to open it.

Misuse of the Term
Although there are many executable files, there are also non-executable files which invoke (call) executable ones.  For example, Java script files (file extensions .jre, .jar, .js, and .jse) are sometimes referred to as programs, but they are simply instructions for an executable already installed on the system.  Even some program installers are this way.  Microsoft Windows systems will sometimes have programs installed on them using Microsoft Installer files (.msi file extension).  These files act like executable files, but actually contain nothing more that instructions and data for the install program included with the system to use.

/Essay: The Sign of the Cross: a Jewish invention,https://www.conservapedia.com//Essay:_The_Sign_of_the_Cross:_a_Jewish_invention,"I am a popularizer. God made me that way. Man would have thought otherwise. I was told to take Spanish in high school, rather than French or German. I would have use of Spanish as I would never go to college and there were many Puerto Ricans in Brooklyn - so said my high school counsellor. So, I see that my knowing a couple of dialects of Ancient Aramaic and Syriac, along with Hebrew, the language of Judaism and Jesus, as being quite a miracle of God. Now, I have a choice. I can remain in the bathroom mumbling to the man I see in the mirror, or I can go out and begin to ""popularize"" for others.
I see the New Testament as intensly Jewish. But outside of the New Testament, is there anything else that is intensely Jewish that speaks of Jesus? Yes there is, and I will tell you of it. Let's take for instance the Cross. Readers of the New Testament will remember that Paul, who called himself, and rightly, an Israelite, from the tribe of Benjamin, a Pharasee, said of the cross, "" I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless, I live"", and, ""God forbid that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.""  And Jesus Himself said, referring to the cross, ""If I am lifted up, I will draw all men to Me."" Well, this is in the New Testament. Where is the community of Jews outside of the New Testament, yet in the New Testament days, who speak of Jesus, who speak of the cross?
The answer is found in the Odes of Solomon
""The Odes of Solomon are hymns of praise and devotion that we inherit from an early poet. The author, the Odist, was a Jew, conceivably an Essene because he intermittently evidences that he knew the Thanksgiving Hymns (the so-called hymnbook of the Qumran Community). The Odist eventually believed that Jesus was the long-awaited Messiah and imagined: 'The dove fluttered over the head of our Lord Messiah, /Because he was her head' (Ode 24:1).
""The collection is identified as the Odes of Solomon, not because they were written by King Solomon in the tenth century B.C., but because they were rightly considered to be in the tradition of Solomon, who was known in the Bible as 'the Beloved.' The Odist uses this term for himself and all like him; it is a concept that helps define the Odes. While Solomon lived in the tenth century B.C., the Odist lived sometime near A.D. 100. He composed the Odes in a form of early Aramaic and Syriac which is a language spoken in the early Christian centuries and was a form of the language spoken by Jesus"" - James Charlesworth

Well, before there were the Dead Sea Scrolls to tell us what 1st century thought could be like, what first century Aramaic could be like, scholars, ever since the discovery in 1909 of this ""Jewish"" literature in Aramaic (Syriac), said something like, Yes, this is Jewish, but it's from the 2nd or 3rd century AD, written by Christians who were ""Judaizing"", that is, making it as if they, too, were ""original"" Jews or trying to bring back Judaism into the Church.  But then, as years went on, other scholars, who could read the original and compare with the new discoveries, said, ""No. this is no later than the first century - and is even earlier than some parts of the New Testament, and was written by Jews who believed in Jesus, who lived in a heavily Jewish area, just outside Palestine (Israel). Among these scholars are two important ones, J.H. Charlesworth, and Samuel Hugh Moffett of Princeton Seminary.

So, what do they say about the ""Odes""- Hymns? That come from this Jewish ""Christian"" community.
 
Firstly, this community of Jewish believers was so early that writings show an even earlier stage than some of the New Testament writings. In the latter writings, yes, there were still a lot of Jews in the ""church"" but most members were gentiles, who, surprisingly, believers in Jesus the Jewish Messiah. The New Testament tells these gentile believers, please, respect your Jewish brothers and sisters in your midst. They were there before you in the faith of the Lord. You gentiles are only recent ""grafts"" into the seed of Abraham. But these Odes are so early that the opposite situation was existing. The community of Jesus was almost totally Jewish and gentiles were starting to come in as believers, and so the Jewish believers had to be told, please, do not dishonor these gentiles who are now coming into your midst. do not despise them. Who told them that? Well it was Jesus Himself. That is right in the middle of Ode 10, which lthe community chanted together, Jesus speaks to them, sort of like the Prophets of old, when the Lord suddenly speaks through the words of the prophet, and Jesus says: 
""The Gentiles who were dispersed are now gathered together.
But I am not defiled in my loving them,
because they praised Me in high places"" *. 
And so, we understand, you ought also not despise them!

Thus, we understand, they went out as a community to the field to pray their Psalms (we have 42 of them) in Aramaic and pray to the Lord. J.H. Charlsworth calls these psalms the worlds first Christian hymnbook. And they did something that the ancient Jewish world and the world of the Tanakh often did. They didn't just think things, and say things, but they acted them out, or made physical gestures that made the point, or helped released their heart into what they were mouthing - just like today, Jews not only say the Shema, and think and say the psalms or other portions of the Tanakh, but also kiss the scrolls as they are passed or walked around, kiss and touch their fingertips and then the ""Mezuzahs"" on the doorposts of their houses, and many other wonderful things of doing, to demonstrate - like celebration of the Passover Seder.

And so they went out into the field, at the start of the day, and they began to pray, and as they did, they did something else. They stood and streched out their arms, and looked out to heaven and prayed out in wonderful Aramaic their psalm 42 and said what they were doing, as they made thus the sign of the cross:

 ""I have extended my hands, and approached my Lord,
For the expansion of my hands is His sign.
And my extension, is the common cross,
That was lifted up on the way of the Righteous One.""
see (A History of Christianity in Asia, Vol. l., Samuel Hugh Moffett, Orbis,{Odes Sol.42:1,2,}, 1998, pg.52) 

So, if you are Jewish and feel like making the sign of the cross, go ahead. It is as Jewish as Matzah ball soup or Gefilte fish (though not particularly Ashkenazi!). And if you are not Jewish and you believe in Jesus, remember, He is the Jewish Messiah, as well as the Savior of the World.

Bert Schlossberg


Note:  Even today, once the Syriac script is put into the Hebrew characters, Hebrew speakers can make out some or most of the Ancient Aramaic prayer from this Jewish Christian community 
An example (Ode 19:1 in transliteration, common roots in bold letters) 
English: ""A cup of milk was offered to me, And I drank it in the sweetness of the Lord's kindness. The Son is the cup.""
Syriac: ""kasa deHalba etqarev li, weshtiteh dbesimuteh deMarya (Mar=Adon=Lord). Bra kasa iitoy""
Hebrew:  ""'kos shel Halav niq'revah eilay weshatiti, be hasday ha Adon. HaBen hu haKos"" (Hebrew speakers would know that the Aramaic BR is the Hebrew BN from ""Bar Mitzvah"" - ""Son of the Commandment)""

Note: Where this Jewish Christian community of Jews lived was either Edessa (not Odessa), the capital of the ancient kingdom of Osrhoene, or nearby Arbela (modern day Irbil in Iraq), the capital of Adiabene. Adiabene was the very last province of the ancient and much feared Assyrian Empire (Jonah was sent by God to Assyrian capital of Nineveh) . In the first century, the queen of Adiabene became Jewish with many of her nobles. Adiabene was the only country to send in fighters to fight alongs the Jews (Judeans) in their revolt against the Romans in the first century. This queen of Adiabene was much honored by the Jews because of this and her charitable works during the same famine that Paul writes about in the New Testament, and she is called in Hebrew, Queen Peace of Zion - Shlomzion Ha Malka. Israeli archaeologist, Michael Avi Yonah, believed (and constructed in his model of the 1st century City of David now in Jerusalem's Hebrew Museum) a full one half of the first century City of David to be Queen Shlomzion's palace. When she died, she was buried in a grand tomb in Jerusalem of her day, now located on Salah id-Din street in East Jerusalem. This tomb was so grand that it was thought by 19th and 20th century archaeologists to be the tombs of the Kings of Israel. My bank in West Jerusalem was situated on Shlomzion Ha Malka street.

Differences between 2008 and other elections
In 2008, CNN-YouTube held the first debate in which the questions asked of the nominees in each party came primarily from YouTube viewer submitted videos. The debates received high ratings, however, CNN was criticized for not picking questions that were 'tough' or pertinent enough. One such example was during the Democratic Debate, when CNN chose to ask a question from a snow man, talking about global warming. During the Republican debate, some claimed that many of the questions were from Democratic supporters just meant to embarrass the Republican candidates. For example, a question over whether or not homosexuals should serve in the U.S. military was asked by retired general and gay activist Keith Kerr, an adviser to Hillary Clinton's campaign. 
The internet has also played a major role in the election, with then-Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul and Democratic candidate Barack Obama being very active on the internet.

Young voters
In 2004, 64% of voters aged 18–29 were registered to vote.  This year 75% of voters in that age group are registered.  This demographic usually favors Democrats.

Fewer Uncommitted
Fewer people were undecided this election than in most previous elections.  As of the beginning of October, 2008 approximately 6-8% of poll respondents were undecided, an amount that continued to decline as the election drew closer.

Election Day
The turnout was about normal, except for higher than usual rates among blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and voters under 30—all Obama groups.  The turnout of evangelicals and whites was similar to 2004. There have been allegations of Democrats driving voters around to different voting stations, and as these are Obama groups, this would strengthen the voter turnout of this demographic.

McCain vs. Obama
McCain had the early edge, wrapping up the Republican nomination before Obama was known to be the choice of the Democrats, but this was one of the few advantages he has had.  Both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama raised far more money than McCain, and the Democratic primary saw a surge of new voters coming out leading to a large increase in the rolls of Democrats.  From the historical position of a generally equal number of Republicans and Democrats, the numbers have now tilted 41% Democrat to only 32% Republican.  From the time that Obama was declared the nominee, opinion polling showed him with a modest advantage over McCain in terms of who the voters would choose to be their next President.
Obama's strategy was to tie McCain to George Bush, a very unpopular President, even though McCain was not a part of the Bush administration and often clashed with Bush during his time as senator.  McCain, for his part, had to walk a fine line with accepting praise from the President to woo conservatives, while at the same time keeping enough distance so as to not alienate moderates.  When possible, McCain went after Obama's lack of foreign policy experience.
The trends heavily favored the Democrats, especially after their major gains in 2006.  Overall, Democrat candidates have a +10% advantage over Republicans in a 'generic' election - the current unpopular President is a Republican, and the economy is treading water.  Also, based on statistical percentages of articles on each candidate, Obama was being focused on by the press far more than McCain.  When McCain chastised Obama for his lack of foreign policy experience and that he hadn't been to Iraq or Afghanistan in years, Obama's campaign set up for him to take a trip to both countries.  While this is expected in politics, the decision of every major network to send a team of reporters to follow him was unprecedented.  Obama spoke to 200,000 people in Berlin in a highly covered speech.  McCain spoke to 50,000 in Buffalo shortly thereafter and barely got a whisper.  Obama's numbers started to rise, but a good deal of the populace was noticing the disparity as 48% of those polled felt the press was trying to help Obama win.
Obama seemed pleased to coast on his advantages, but McCain realized he needed to shake things up.  He scored by pushing offshore drilling for oil during a time when oil prices were climbing almost daily.  Obama rejected the idea, but the poll numbers started to show a greater percentage of Americans warming to the concept[2] and McCain's numbers started to improve.  Obama announced he would accept some measure of offshore drilling, and McCain's momentum was halted and his gains retreated by a couple of points.  McCain started an ad campaign that acknowledged Obama's celebrity status, but asking what it meant.  A few days later at the start of August he called out Obama for 'playing the race card' when Obama made a reference to McCain and Bush trying to scare people because he (Obama) doesn't look like other Presidents on dollar bills.  The Democrats fired back, but quickly let the issue drop when poll numbers showed that most voters did consider Obama's statement to be racist.[3]  The bounce for Obama after the Berlin speech shrank back to pre-trip levels.  While Obama continued to enjoy a slight lead in the polls, McCain continued to keep the race close without either candidate breaking away. 
In mid-August, both candidates came together at the invitation of Pastor Rick Warren where each was asked a series of the same questions dealing both with political and personal views.  While not a debate, it was the first televised forum where both candidates had a chance to express themselves and their positions.  Obama hoped to appeal to Christian conservatives by expressing a religious side while McCain hoped to solidify the conservative base by sharing his own conservative and religious credentials.  The difference in style between the two was evident as Obama spent more time explaining and expounding on his positions while McCain was more straightforward and received more laughs with his candid speaking style.  The polling numbers continued as they had been.
There was a bounce at the start of the Democratic convention, but not what was expected as McCain suddenly drew even in the race.  The friction between Hillary Clinton and Obama as well as the perceived slight of Hillary when Biden was chosen as the Vice Presidential candidate hurt Obama at a time when his approval was expected to climb.  McCain then made a mistake by airing an ad of Hillary Clinton that 'supported' him.  Clinton was set to speak at the convention and it was no secret that there was bad blood between her and Obama and it was widely believed that her support for Obama would be lukewarm at best.  Instead, apparently galvanized by McCain's hubris before her speech, she came out strongly for Obama and rallied those who supported her.  Obama's pre-convention edge returned.  Obama followed it up with a very strong speech the next day in a huge stadium with fireworks and a Greek temple.  Dick Morris, a former Bill Clinton political strategist who gave advice to the Republicans in 2008, felt that Obama had done such a good job reaching out to the groups that he needed that he would pull ahead by double-digits.  In order to suppress the bounce from the convention, McCain announced his Vice Presidential candidate the next day, a woman, Alaskan governor Sarah Palin.  The bounce for Obama was muted at first, but increased in the following days to surpass pre-convention levels, especially as Sarah Palin came under heavy attack in the media.
The edge continued as the Republican convention began.  Losing a day to the hurricane, their shortened convention came out strong as well, emphasizing John McCain as a patriot and a maverick for change who is tested and will do what is right for the country regardless of political affiliation.  It was notable for the secondary role that the sitting President played, talking only briefly and barely being mentioned after that.  The convention tied McCain to Ronald Reagan, a popular Republican President who was able to gain the support of a good number of conservative Democrats, an ability that McCain would badly need to emulate.  While the convention had very high ratings starting with Palin's well received speech, it was unclear what the impact would be in the polls.  Indeed, Obama continued to lead directly afterward, but that soon changed with a turn of about 8 points and a slim lead for McCain.  The Republican convention had actually more than balanced out the powerful Democratic convention.
While Obama had stated that his campaign would avoid negative advertising, as it became clear that the bounce from the convention was continuing to last and he might lose the election, his campaign turned more forcefully to negative advertising.  In ads aired since the Republican convention through mid September, McCain's ads were about Obama 56% of the time, but Obama's ads were about his opponents 77% of the time.[4]  Obama also received a large boost from the press which vigorously attacked McCain, but even more so Palin.  Obama appeared on The O'Reilly Factor and was treated with civility and respect, even if not with agreement.  McCain and his wife appeared on The View and were treated to openly antagonistic attacks.  The constant negative barrage and reporting slowly moved the numbers back to even.
As the negative articles on Palin continued to intensify, some of which just quoted celebrities who had never met her calling her ""whacko"" or a ""hater of women"", her first major interview with Gibson was a turning point.  Gibson asked Palin about the Bush Doctrine, but wouldn't define it for her even as she asked questions for clarifications.  When she then answered with her understanding, Gibson rebuked her by implying that she misunderstood the doctrine.  In truth, since the term is only a press invention, it has taken on different meanings at different times and the definition that Palin gave matched one that Gibson himself had used years earlier.  Nevertheless, it was a moment and was jumped on by the press.  Those who saw the interview voted heavily that they were now less likely to vote for Palin.  The attack on her had muted her effectiveness, even if it was unjustified.
Stemming the tide of the McCain campaign's lead became a strong swing for Obama with a series of events that went to the Democratic nominee's favor.  The polls began to tack to Obama's favor with the collapse of Lehman Brothers and a subsequent 500-point drop in the Dow Jones Index.  Then, President Bush sounded a major alarm on the economy and proposed a huge 700 billion dollar rescue plan for the mortgage industry, which sent shock waves through the American populace and swept them with even more fear on the economic picture.  Bush called both Presidential nominees to meet with him and Congress.  It gave Obama a boost in legitimacy, his previous Achilles' heel.  While he had a weak record in accomplishments and showing leadership, the chance to be propelled to a position of prominence handed it to him on a silver platter.  Moreover, the plan was more problematic among Republicans than it was among Democrats, giving Obama another boost merely by supporting it while putting McCain on more shaky ground.  Both candidates supported it once again blurring McCain's advantage in experience if both men were seen as interchangeable in their reaction.
McCain chose to suspend his campaign until a deal on the rescue package was reached, a mistake.  The Democrats could add pork to the plan and make it even more unpalatable to the Republicans, and they did.  As the first debate loomed and no deal had been reached, McCain was in a quandary.  He chose to attend the debate under the view that the plan was well under way to being passed.  After the debate the plan was actually defeated and wouldn't be adopted, with more changes, until the following week.
McCain's debate with Obama went well and he was viewed as having done better than expected.  Unfortunately for him, Obama was also viewed as doing better than expected and was seen as looking Presidential, further cementing his standing and locking in a lead in the polls that had become rather substantial.  The Vice Presidential debate was the most watched in history and Palin was given high marks for her performance, but unfortunately for the Republican ticket, Biden was also on his game that night and also came across well.  There were no changes in the polling numbers and the number of undecided voters began to quickly dwindle.  The second and third debates caused little change as well.
With Obama spending 110 million dollars on TV advertising in October alone, including 30 minute specials on each of the major networks, McCain was hard pressed to make up the necessary ground to win the election after being outspent by 3 to 1 for TV adds over that time period.  He couldn't count on regular TV to help put in a good word for him either, as late night political jokes are running at a pace of 7 jokes against McCain/Palin for every 1 joke against Obama/Biden and a study of news stories on McCain and Obama since the end of the conventions found that 57% of news stories about McCain were negative while only 29% were for Obama.[5]  A later study by the independent Pew Research Center found that the discrepancy had grown even worse.  McCain had 57% of the articles about him negative while only 14% were positive, while Obama had more positive articles than negative.  The only network to achieve a balance, 40% negative for both, was Fox News.[6]

General Strategy
McCain's team emphasized to convince the electorate of the long-term leadership and experience that John McCain has shown in two decades of government service while emphasizing the relative untested nature of Barack Obama.
Obama's team stressed that Obama is the candidate of fresh ideas while downplaying his relative inexperience compared to the more seasoned McCain.  When possible, McCain is lumped together with George Bush, an unpopular President.

Republican Strategy
With more limited funding than his Democratic rival, McCain had favored open town hall meetings to attract the greatest number of people.  He is focusing his advertising on swing states.  He also asked for open debates with Obama of the Lincoln-Douglas variety where candidates can talk directly to each other, but this was not accepted by the Democratic camp which prefers the current structured format.
McCain will highlight his record of leadership, his service to his country and stress that as President he can be counted on to keep America safe from outside threats.  McCain's strongest supporters are the elderly - the group that most wants stability.
McCain's choice of Sarah Palin as his Vice Presidential nominee was a departure from what was expected and helped to show that he would go down paths that the Republican party had not done in the past.  McCain has touted Palin's record of standing up to the Alaska Republican party when she resigned from an Ethics Commission in protest over a lack of ethics of fellow commissioners, as well as when she ran against, and beat, then-incumbent Governor Frank Murkowski in the Republican primary in 2006.  McCain will continue to tout her as a ""maverick"" to complement his own maverick image that he is trying to emphasize. Last, by choosing a female running mate, McCain hoped to pick up the votes of female voters disaffected with the perceived slight of Hillary Clinton by Obama.  Prior to the start of the Democratic convention, 30% of Hillary's supporters had still not backed Obama and there was a good deal of bad blood between the two.
With the unfolding of the campaign season and watching the Democratic strategy and how it was playing out in the press and polls, the McCain campaign decided not to cede the moniker of change to Obama, but rather to take it upon themselves by emphasizing that McCain has a track record of change - while Obama does not.  The McCain campaign feels it needs to have the voters ask who can be trusted more to get the job done, and if that occurs, then they have the advantage.
With the selection of Palin, and the energy it has brought to the conservative base, McCain has taken to larger rallies, as opposed to town hall meetings and press conferences.  By mid-September, he had gone four weeks without a town hall, and three weeks without a press conference, instead sticking to larger engagements, appearing alongside his vice presidential nominee, with larger crowds than he had experienced earlier in his campaign.

Democratic Strategy
Democrats are confident that the low popularity of President Bush and particularly Operation Iraqi Freedom, which John McCain supports, puts them in a highly favorable position for 2008.  They have been cautious in the Iraq arena realizing that 'The Surge' worked and they were on the wrong end of that issue.  Focus is being put on a timeline for troops coming home, a position that most of the American population favors.
Democrats believe it is their race to lose, but also realize they had a good chance to win the last two Presidential elections and came up short each time.  General wisdom also states that a poor economy favors Obama, so they will emphasize the dire times in this area.  As in past elections, differences between those who have obtained a high income level and those who have not will be emphasized. In fact, the Democratic strategy in many ways mirrors that of their strategy in 1992 when the Democrat-controlled Congress deliberately caused economic disruption, knowing full well that the public would blame sitting president George H.W. Bush, and thereby allowing Bill Clinton to win that year's presidential race.
Favored by the young, Democrats will try hard to encourage and get out the young vote, a task that has proven more difficult than expected in the last two election cycles.  To their advantage, Obama made his vice presidential pick via text message to cell phone numbers registered on the site.  The announcement went to 3 million cell phones, a useful database for ""Get Out The Vote"" (GOTV) efforts, when voters may not be home or reachable on their landline.
As an extension of the DNC's strategy in the 2006 elections, led by Howard Dean, Barack Obama has been working towards a ""50-state strategy.""  The campaign is working to place campaign offices throughout the country with a focus on voter registration.  The increase in the rolls of Democratic voters from the primary battle between Hillary Clinton and Obama played out well for the Democrats and puts pressure on Senator McCain even in typically red states, and more specifically, ""Lean Republican"" states, to use the Cook Political Report's term.  In addition, with a fundraising advantage, Obama is airing ads in those tight states forcing McCain to make decisions about whether to use funds to match ads and campaign efforts in those states or rely on historical results that those states will support him and focus funds in traditional toss-up states instead.

Fundraising
Barack Obama had a significant edge over Hillary Clinton in the fundraising department during their contest for the Democratic nomination, but both actually set records for raising money and both raised far more money than John McCain.  McCain didn't have to spend as much since he locked up the Republican nomination much earlier than Obama locked up the Democratic.  Both Obama and McCain said they would accept government funds—which would also cap how much the candidates could raise on their own—but Obama, who could presumably raise more through his own sources, changed his mind and later declined.  Much of McCain's war chest will come from the Republican Party in general, which has more money to spend than their Democratic counterparts.  McCain's campaign raised $47 million in August, a very sizable figure for him so far and a personal record, but not as strong as Obama's best months. In the same time period, Obama set a record with $66 million. Obama, still having an edge in fundraising that has continued throughout his run for the Presidency, saw $10 million collected the day after Sarah Palin's strongly received convention speech, a new one day record.[7]  The Palin announcement has been good for John McCain's fundraising as well.
Obama set a new record of $150 million raised in September and over $600 million overall.[8]  Obama's camp does not release information on who contributes to the campaign.


Conventions
Democratic National Convention
For a more detailed treatment, see 2008 Democratic National Convention.
The 2008 Democratic National Convention was held in Denver, Colorado, from August 25 to August 27 at Pepsi Center. There, Senator Obama and his running mate were selected to be the party nominee's. Barack Obama will accepted the party's nomination in front of a crowd of more than 75,000 in a free, open event held at INVESCO Field at Mile High, in a platform resemblant to a Greek temple. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is the Permanent Chair of the Convention.
The convention had a rocky start as friction between supporters of Obama and the Clintons was not resolved.  Instead of Obama getting a bump in the polls, his support actually declined.  The Democrats also seemed to be at odds on finding a unifying strategy for how hard to attack John McCain and how to present it.  As Democratic pundit James Carville said in an interview on CNN, ""If this party has a message, it's done a <heck> of a job hiding it tonight, I promise you that.""[9]
A bleak convention was turned around by the Clintons. Infighting between Obama and Hillary continued through the day of her speech, but a comprise was reached, and, beyond expectations, she gave a rousing speech for Obama - possibly as an angry response to McCain's latest ad that showed her 'supporting' him. Bill Clinton the next night also praised Obama, something that he failed to effectively do in 2000 for Al Gore when he centered on his accomplishments and gave little more than lip service to Gore with statements amounting to 'and Al Gore was there too'. The convention, possibly remembering that, gave him the topic he was to speak on instead of choosing his own. Clinton was angered, but it worked. He came through. By the time Obama spoke on the last night, the theme that was missing at first was clear, and Obama mixed a message of attacking McCain with the need for change and even outlining some expensive programs that would appeal to the target populace who has been lukewarm to him. From a political point of view, the convention did what it was supposed to.


Republican National Convention
For a more detailed treatment, see 2008 Republican National Convention.
The 2008 Republican National Convention was held in Saint Paul, Minnesota from September 1 (Labor Day) until September 4. The presumptive nominee was Senator McCain. The location has political significance in that Minnesota will likely be a close state during the general election, as will its neighboring states Wisconsin and Iowa.
The convention schedule had to be altered due to the upcoming landfall of Hurricane Gustav. The first day almost entirely focused on raising money for Hurricane relief.  This led to a shortened three day convention instead of four and there was some shuffling of who was speaking on which day to accommodate the suddenly shortened time span.  In a surprise, George W. Bush was only delivered an eight-minute speech by satellite.  In another surprise Sarah Palin's speech was watched by as many people as saw Obama give his acceptance speech on the closing night of the Democratic convention, as over 40 million people tuned in.[10]  She was considered the highlight of the convention, even surpassing John McCain's speech the next day, and was noted for doing an exceptional job.  Recognizing the strong asset that they have in her, the Republicans made reference to her many times on the last day of the convention.  McCain, not known for being comfortable reading prepared speeches in a convention hall, delivered a solid speech.  While Obama continued to enjoy a lead in the polls, it changed quickly thereafter to a slight McCain-Palin edge.  The Republican convention more than canceled out a very powerful Democratic convention.

Leftist violence
 Poster circulated by community organizers. Other posters depicted rock throwers with the caption, ""Shut Down the RNC!,"" dead elephants, and derogatory and demeaning comments about gay Republicans. [2]
Progressives for Obama shares a huge membership overlap with the Movement for a Democratic Society (MDS), a group of former Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) members and sympathisers. MDS re-founded SDS in 2006 for a new generation of college students and functions as a support group for SDS's 130 college chapters. Independent researcher Trevor Louden refers to MDS as ""the brains behind the SDS brawn.""  The reconstituted SDS was very prominent in the violence at the Republican National Convention at St Paul.[11] The founder of ACORN, Wade Rathke, denouncd[12] an FBI informer who foiled a terrorist plot to kill delegates at the Republican Convention.[13]

Vice Presidential Candidates
Democratic Vice-Presidential Candidate
On August 23, Senator Barack Obama announced, via text message to 3 million cell phone numbers of his supporters, his nomination of Joseph Biden to Vice President.  Biden's selection was considered to be a prudent move by Obama, filling a hole in his own foreign policy experience that McCain could exploit.  With the implosion of John Edwards, Biden was widely expected to be the choice.  In order to help build up suspense, Biden said he was not chosen when he spoke to the press the day before, only to be shown as the Vice Presidential candidate the next day.  A long-term senator and Washington insider with over two decades of service in the Senate, his earlier 1988 plagiarism scandal and frequent gaffes (including one in which he insulted Obama in a racist manner during the 2008 election) were deemed to be less negative than the positive that his strong experience credentials could bring to the race.  

 Joseph Biden




Republican Vice-Presidential Candidate
 thumb
Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska was announced as John McCain's choice early on Friday, August 29, the day after the Democratic convention ended.  A surprise choice not even considered by the press to be on McCain's short list, her selection caught the political world off guard.  It had been expected that Mitt Romney would earn the honor, but McCain had other ideas.  At first denigrated by the people in the Obama campaign, Obama's own statement was one of cautious neutrality to feel out what impact her selection would have on the race.


In an interesting twist, the selection of the Vice Presidential candidates changed the dynamics of the race.  By Obama picking Biden, he helped to fill the hole that McCain had been attacking dealing with a lack of foreign policy experience.  McCain's strongest point, experience, would lose some of its luster.  But the selection of Biden, and the passing over of Hillary Clinton, left another opening.  By aligning himself with someone who has been a Democratic stalwart, Obama's claim to change became less pronounced.  McCain seized upon that to select a Vice President that no one expected, and a woman, and steal some of the Democratic thunder.  Her lack of foreign policy experience would cut into the experience angle that had been in play earlier, but her own maverick streak in becoming governor by ousting another Republican, combined with John McCain's maverick choice in selecting her led to a new emphasis on McCain's own maverick past. Palin arguably had more ""executive"" / managerial experience than either McCain, Biden or, notably, Obama.  Suddenly he saw an opportunity to steal the moniker of change that Obama had been wearing, and he went for it.  Such a change in position occurring from the Vice Presidential selection is rare in Presidential politics.

Debates
Presidential Debates
For a more detailed treatment, see 2008 Presidential Debates.
There have been three presidential debates for the 2008 election season.  The first debate on September 26 discussed ""Foreign Policy & National Security"" and also dealt at length with the economic crisis. The result was a statistical draw where both candidates did better than expected in the eyes of the public.  The longer term impact worked out well for Obama who already had a lead going in, and benefited from solidifying that position.
The second debate on October 7, followed a town hall-style.  The questions came from audience members and the Internet, as chosen by the moderator.  Again the result was a statistical draw as far as who was considered to be the winner.  But with time running out for McCain, he needed something to make the people move his way, and that required a clear breakthrough that never happened
The final debate was held on October 15 concerned ""Domestic and Economic Policy."" Both candidates were again viewed as having done well, which was a tactical defeat for McCain as the poll numbers showed only small changes.

Vice Presidential Debate
There was one vice presidential debate held on October 2.  Palin did much better than expected, but Biden was also in top form.  No clear winner emerged and the poll numbers remained largely unchanged, a strategic win for the Democratic ticket that only had to maintain their lead to win the election.  The number of people who watched the debate was an alltime record for a Vice Presidential debate, and was viewed by more people than any of the three Presidential debates.

Third parties and Independents
As usual there were a number of third party candidates, but none made much of an impact.  Briefly the Libertarian Bob Barr had enough strength to become a spoiler for McCain.  He faded quickly. See United States Presidential Election, 2008 -- Third Party Candidates.

Primaries
For expanded primary information, see United States Presidential Election, 2008 - Primaries
The primary season for both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party officially began on January 3, 2008 with the Iowa Caucuses and ended on June 3, 2008.[14]  The 2008 election cycle saw a major shift in the primary election calendar, frontloading many primaries into early February.[15]
John McCain had to get his footing at first, but was pretty much assured the Republican nomination after Super Tuesday.  Barack Obama had a much tougher road, but rode out a string of victories in February to eventually outlast Clinton and take the nomination.  During that time he had raised more money than any other candidate in history giving him a huge boost, a trend that would continue into the general election.

Appeal for Home Security
The .40 S&W is popular for home security for several reasons. The first is that it offers greater stopping power than the 9mm, while maintaining more manageable recoil and a lower price per round than the .45 ACP. The second is that it is the standard issue round for many law enforcement agencies in the United States.

2004 Madrid bombings,https://www.conservapedia.com/2004_Madrid_bombings,"The 2004 Madrid train bombings (also known as 11/3 after the pattern of 9/11, but in European style) was a collection of coordinated terrorist bombings against the commuter train system of Madrid, Spain  which killed 191 people and wounded 1,460 on the morning of March 11, 2004.  The Islamic group al Qaeda was responsible.[1]

The Attacks

The attacks consisted of a series of ten explosions that occurred at the peak of the Madrid rush hour aboard four commuter trains. Thirteen improvised explosive devices were reported to have been used, all but three of which detonated.
The attacks were the deadliest assault by a terrorist organization against civilians in Europe since the Lockerbie bombing in 1988 and the worst terrorist assault in modern Spanish history. The number of victims in this attack far surpassed Spain's previous worst bombing incident in Barcelona in 1987, which killed 21, carried out by the Basque armed terrorist group Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (""Basque Fatherland and Liberty"").  Official statements issued shortly after the Madrid attacks identified ETA as the prime suspect, but the group, which usually claims responsibility for its actions, denied any wrongdoing.[2]
The explosions occurred during the morning rush hour, targeting a busy commuter rail line that runs just south of downtown Madrid. Four bombs (planted at the front, middle, and rear of a single train) exploded at 7:39 at Atocha station, and three bombs planted on a single train went off simultaneously just outside of Téllez street, near Atocha station. Two more bombs on one train detonated at 7:41 at El Pozo del Tío Raimundo station. One further bomb exploded on a train at Santa Eugenia station at 7:42. Most of the casualties occurred at Atocha/Téllez (89 confirmed dead) and El Pozo (70) with another 17 at Santa Eugenia.
Eventually, 191 people were confirmed dead (177 at the scene, 13 while under medical care), and 1,460 were wounded. Initial reports of 202 deaths were later revised down due to the misidentification of body parts.[3]
Initially it was feared that families of illegal immigrants would be afraid to contact the authorities for fear of being deported for immigration violations, but Spanish Prime Minister José María Aznar announced an immigration amnesty for victims of the attack.
The explosion at Téllez street appears to have been timed to coincide with the explosion at Atocha. However, the train carrying the bombs was held up by a red signal and so exploded just outside of the station.
Two unexploded bombs were found at the centre and rear of the train. The nine bombs aboard the Atocha and Téllez trains were, according to experts, designed to bring down the roof of the entire station at Atocha.
Security forces carried out a controlled explosion of a suspicious package found near the Atocha station and subsequently deactivated the two undetonated devices on the Téllez train. A third unexploded device was later brought from the station at El Pozo to a police station in Vallecas, and became a central piece of evidence for the investigation. It appears that at least the El Pozo bomb failed to detonate because a cell-phone alarm used to trigger the bomb was set 12 hours late.
All of the devices are thought to have been hidden inside backpacks. Despite Spanish Government's claims that the explosive used was titadine, a type of compressed dynamite used by ETA in recent years, forensic analysis of one of the remaining unexploded devices found at El Pozo revealed the explosive used there to be Goma-2, manufactured in Spain and not used by ETA since the 1980s. The police investigated reports of three people in ski masks getting on and off the trains several times at Alcalá de Henares between 7:00 and 7:10. A van was found parked outside the station at Alcalá de Henares containing detonators, audio tapes with Qur'anic verses, and cell phones.[4][5]

Responsibility
Although ETA has a history of mounting bomb attacks in Madrid, planting delayed-action bombs to kill rescue workers and using booby traps (such as explosives in wallets), as well as also having attempted to attack trains, the March 11 attacks were on a scale far exceeding anything previously attempted by a European terrorist organisation. Observers have also noted that ETA customarily issues warnings before its mass bombings and that there was no warning for this attack. Europol director Jürgen Storbeck has commented that the bombings ""don't correspond to the modus operandi which ETA has adopted up to now"". These observations led to early suspicion of Islamic terrorists, who prefer larger body counts. 
The attacks came exactly 30 months, or exactly 911 days, after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City. This followed the noted pattern of Islamofacist terrorist groups choosing to strike on days of significance to them.  It is also worth noting the similarities between the Madrid attack and the September 11 attacks: both were highly calculated, using public transportation to inflict civilian casualties and mass devastation in a spectacular fashion.
Osama bin Laden issued a public threat in October 2003 to carry out suicide bombings against any countries joining the US-led invasion of Iraq: ""We reserve the right to retaliate at the appropriate time and place against all countries involved, especially Britain, Spain, Australia, Poland, Japan and Italy."" At the time, Spain had some 1,300 soldiers stationed on Iraqi soil. In addition, bin Laden had spoken earlier of wishing to return the southern Spanish region of Andalucia to Muslim control, reversing the Reconquista of 1492.[6]
Information made public on March 12 by the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI) revealed that intelligence agencies had known for two months that a terrorist attack was being planned against a country entering into an election period. However, they mistakenly believed that country to be Iraq. The supporting documents, written in Arabic, belonged to a senior al-Qaeda leader, Yusuf al-Airi, and had been obtained by the FFI over the Internet, after his death in May [2003].
According to the FFI Muslim fundamentalism expert Thomas Hegghammer, the documents described in detail the tactics and strategies that were to be employed. The tactic was to break the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq by performing successive strikes on the co-operating member states, starting with the one which would most easily lose its resolve to keep its troops stationed in Iraq, and then following on with the rest. The Iraq war was very unpopular in Spain (around 90% refused to participate in this conflict), and so this would make a likely first target.

Differences between 2008 and other elections
In 2008, CNN-YouTube held the first debate in which the questions asked of the nominees in each party came primarily from YouTube viewer submitted videos. The debates received high ratings, however, CNN was criticized for not picking questions that were 'tough' or pertinent enough. One such example was during the Democratic Debate, when CNN chose to ask a question from a snow man, talking about global warming. During the Republican debate, some claimed that many of the questions were from Democratic supporters just meant to embarrass the Republican candidates. For example, a question over whether or not homosexuals should serve in the U.S. military was asked by retired general and gay activist Keith Kerr, an adviser to Hillary Clinton's campaign. 
The internet has also played a major role in the election, with then-Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul and Democratic candidate Barack Obama being very active on the internet.

Young voters
In 2004, 64% of voters aged 18–29 were registered to vote.  This year 75% of voters in that age group are registered.  This demographic usually favors Democrats.

Fewer Uncommitted
Fewer people were undecided this election than in most previous elections.  As of the beginning of October, 2008 approximately 6-8% of poll respondents were undecided, an amount that continued to decline as the election drew closer.

Election Day
The turnout was about normal, except for higher than usual rates among blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and voters under 30—all Obama groups.  The turnout of evangelicals and whites was similar to 2004. There have been allegations of Democrats driving voters around to different voting stations, and as these are Obama groups, this would strengthen the voter turnout of this demographic.

McCain vs. Obama
McCain had the early edge, wrapping up the Republican nomination before Obama was known to be the choice of the Democrats, but this was one of the few advantages he has had.  Both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama raised far more money than McCain, and the Democratic primary saw a surge of new voters coming out leading to a large increase in the rolls of Democrats.  From the historical position of a generally equal number of Republicans and Democrats, the numbers have now tilted 41% Democrat to only 32% Republican.  From the time that Obama was declared the nominee, opinion polling showed him with a modest advantage over McCain in terms of who the voters would choose to be their next President.
Obama's strategy was to tie McCain to George Bush, a very unpopular President, even though McCain was not a part of the Bush administration and often clashed with Bush during his time as senator.  McCain, for his part, had to walk a fine line with accepting praise from the President to woo conservatives, while at the same time keeping enough distance so as to not alienate moderates.  When possible, McCain went after Obama's lack of foreign policy experience.
The trends heavily favored the Democrats, especially after their major gains in 2006.  Overall, Democrat candidates have a +10% advantage over Republicans in a 'generic' election - the current unpopular President is a Republican, and the economy is treading water.  Also, based on statistical percentages of articles on each candidate, Obama was being focused on by the press far more than McCain.  When McCain chastised Obama for his lack of foreign policy experience and that he hadn't been to Iraq or Afghanistan in years, Obama's campaign set up for him to take a trip to both countries.  While this is expected in politics, the decision of every major network to send a team of reporters to follow him was unprecedented.  Obama spoke to 200,000 people in Berlin in a highly covered speech.  McCain spoke to 50,000 in Buffalo shortly thereafter and barely got a whisper.  Obama's numbers started to rise, but a good deal of the populace was noticing the disparity as 48% of those polled felt the press was trying to help Obama win.
Obama seemed pleased to coast on his advantages, but McCain realized he needed to shake things up.  He scored by pushing offshore drilling for oil during a time when oil prices were climbing almost daily.  Obama rejected the idea, but the poll numbers started to show a greater percentage of Americans warming to the concept[2] and McCain's numbers started to improve.  Obama announced he would accept some measure of offshore drilling, and McCain's momentum was halted and his gains retreated by a couple of points.  McCain started an ad campaign that acknowledged Obama's celebrity status, but asking what it meant.  A few days later at the start of August he called out Obama for 'playing the race card' when Obama made a reference to McCain and Bush trying to scare people because he (Obama) doesn't look like other Presidents on dollar bills.  The Democrats fired back, but quickly let the issue drop when poll numbers showed that most voters did consider Obama's statement to be racist.[3]  The bounce for Obama after the Berlin speech shrank back to pre-trip levels.  While Obama continued to enjoy a slight lead in the polls, McCain continued to keep the race close without either candidate breaking away. 
In mid-August, both candidates came together at the invitation of Pastor Rick Warren where each was asked a series of the same questions dealing both with political and personal views.  While not a debate, it was the first televised forum where both candidates had a chance to express themselves and their positions.  Obama hoped to appeal to Christian conservatives by expressing a religious side while McCain hoped to solidify the conservative base by sharing his own conservative and religious credentials.  The difference in style between the two was evident as Obama spent more time explaining and expounding on his positions while McCain was more straightforward and received more laughs with his candid speaking style.  The polling numbers continued as they had been.
There was a bounce at the start of the Democratic convention, but not what was expected as McCain suddenly drew even in the race.  The friction between Hillary Clinton and Obama as well as the perceived slight of Hillary when Biden was chosen as the Vice Presidential candidate hurt Obama at a time when his approval was expected to climb.  McCain then made a mistake by airing an ad of Hillary Clinton that 'supported' him.  Clinton was set to speak at the convention and it was no secret that there was bad blood between her and Obama and it was widely believed that her support for Obama would be lukewarm at best.  Instead, apparently galvanized by McCain's hubris before her speech, she came out strongly for Obama and rallied those who supported her.  Obama's pre-convention edge returned.  Obama followed it up with a very strong speech the next day in a huge stadium with fireworks and a Greek temple.  Dick Morris, a former Bill Clinton political strategist who gave advice to the Republicans in 2008, felt that Obama had done such a good job reaching out to the groups that he needed that he would pull ahead by double-digits.  In order to suppress the bounce from the convention, McCain announced his Vice Presidential candidate the next day, a woman, Alaskan governor Sarah Palin.  The bounce for Obama was muted at first, but increased in the following days to surpass pre-convention levels, especially as Sarah Palin came under heavy attack in the media.
The edge continued as the Republican convention began.  Losing a day to the hurricane, their shortened convention came out strong as well, emphasizing John McCain as a patriot and a maverick for change who is tested and will do what is right for the country regardless of political affiliation.  It was notable for the secondary role that the sitting President played, talking only briefly and barely being mentioned after that.  The convention tied McCain to Ronald Reagan, a popular Republican President who was able to gain the support of a good number of conservative Democrats, an ability that McCain would badly need to emulate.  While the convention had very high ratings starting with Palin's well received speech, it was unclear what the impact would be in the polls.  Indeed, Obama continued to lead directly afterward, but that soon changed with a turn of about 8 points and a slim lead for McCain.  The Republican convention had actually more than balanced out the powerful Democratic convention.
While Obama had stated that his campaign would avoid negative advertising, as it became clear that the bounce from the convention was continuing to last and he might lose the election, his campaign turned more forcefully to negative advertising.  In ads aired since the Republican convention through mid September, McCain's ads were about Obama 56% of the time, but Obama's ads were about his opponents 77% of the time.[4]  Obama also received a large boost from the press which vigorously attacked McCain, but even more so Palin.  Obama appeared on The O'Reilly Factor and was treated with civility and respect, even if not with agreement.  McCain and his wife appeared on The View and were treated to openly antagonistic attacks.  The constant negative barrage and reporting slowly moved the numbers back to even.
As the negative articles on Palin continued to intensify, some of which just quoted celebrities who had never met her calling her ""whacko"" or a ""hater of women"", her first major interview with Gibson was a turning point.  Gibson asked Palin about the Bush Doctrine, but wouldn't define it for her even as she asked questions for clarifications.  When she then answered with her understanding, Gibson rebuked her by implying that she misunderstood the doctrine.  In truth, since the term is only a press invention, it has taken on different meanings at different times and the definition that Palin gave matched one that Gibson himself had used years earlier.  Nevertheless, it was a moment and was jumped on by the press.  Those who saw the interview voted heavily that they were now less likely to vote for Palin.  The attack on her had muted her effectiveness, even if it was unjustified.
Stemming the tide of the McCain campaign's lead became a strong swing for Obama with a series of events that went to the Democratic nominee's favor.  The polls began to tack to Obama's favor with the collapse of Lehman Brothers and a subsequent 500-point drop in the Dow Jones Index.  Then, President Bush sounded a major alarm on the economy and proposed a huge 700 billion dollar rescue plan for the mortgage industry, which sent shock waves through the American populace and swept them with even more fear on the economic picture.  Bush called both Presidential nominees to meet with him and Congress.  It gave Obama a boost in legitimacy, his previous Achilles' heel.  While he had a weak record in accomplishments and showing leadership, the chance to be propelled to a position of prominence handed it to him on a silver platter.  Moreover, the plan was more problematic among Republicans than it was among Democrats, giving Obama another boost merely by supporting it while putting McCain on more shaky ground.  Both candidates supported it once again blurring McCain's advantage in experience if both men were seen as interchangeable in their reaction.
McCain chose to suspend his campaign until a deal on the rescue package was reached, a mistake.  The Democrats could add pork to the plan and make it even more unpalatable to the Republicans, and they did.  As the first debate loomed and no deal had been reached, McCain was in a quandary.  He chose to attend the debate under the view that the plan was well under way to being passed.  After the debate the plan was actually defeated and wouldn't be adopted, with more changes, until the following week.
McCain's debate with Obama went well and he was viewed as having done better than expected.  Unfortunately for him, Obama was also viewed as doing better than expected and was seen as looking Presidential, further cementing his standing and locking in a lead in the polls that had become rather substantial.  The Vice Presidential debate was the most watched in history and Palin was given high marks for her performance, but unfortunately for the Republican ticket, Biden was also on his game that night and also came across well.  There were no changes in the polling numbers and the number of undecided voters began to quickly dwindle.  The second and third debates caused little change as well.
With Obama spending 110 million dollars on TV advertising in October alone, including 30 minute specials on each of the major networks, McCain was hard pressed to make up the necessary ground to win the election after being outspent by 3 to 1 for TV adds over that time period.  He couldn't count on regular TV to help put in a good word for him either, as late night political jokes are running at a pace of 7 jokes against McCain/Palin for every 1 joke against Obama/Biden and a study of news stories on McCain and Obama since the end of the conventions found that 57% of news stories about McCain were negative while only 29% were for Obama.[5]  A later study by the independent Pew Research Center found that the discrepancy had grown even worse.  McCain had 57% of the articles about him negative while only 14% were positive, while Obama had more positive articles than negative.  The only network to achieve a balance, 40% negative for both, was Fox News.[6]

General Strategy
McCain's team emphasized to convince the electorate of the long-term leadership and experience that John McCain has shown in two decades of government service while emphasizing the relative untested nature of Barack Obama.
Obama's team stressed that Obama is the candidate of fresh ideas while downplaying his relative inexperience compared to the more seasoned McCain.  When possible, McCain is lumped together with George Bush, an unpopular President.

Republican Strategy
With more limited funding than his Democratic rival, McCain had favored open town hall meetings to attract the greatest number of people.  He is focusing his advertising on swing states.  He also asked for open debates with Obama of the Lincoln-Douglas variety where candidates can talk directly to each other, but this was not accepted by the Democratic camp which prefers the current structured format.
McCain will highlight his record of leadership, his service to his country and stress that as President he can be counted on to keep America safe from outside threats.  McCain's strongest supporters are the elderly - the group that most wants stability.
McCain's choice of Sarah Palin as his Vice Presidential nominee was a departure from what was expected and helped to show that he would go down paths that the Republican party had not done in the past.  McCain has touted Palin's record of standing up to the Alaska Republican party when she resigned from an Ethics Commission in protest over a lack of ethics of fellow commissioners, as well as when she ran against, and beat, then-incumbent Governor Frank Murkowski in the Republican primary in 2006.  McCain will continue to tout her as a ""maverick"" to complement his own maverick image that he is trying to emphasize. Last, by choosing a female running mate, McCain hoped to pick up the votes of female voters disaffected with the perceived slight of Hillary Clinton by Obama.  Prior to the start of the Democratic convention, 30% of Hillary's supporters had still not backed Obama and there was a good deal of bad blood between the two.
With the unfolding of the campaign season and watching the Democratic strategy and how it was playing out in the press and polls, the McCain campaign decided not to cede the moniker of change to Obama, but rather to take it upon themselves by emphasizing that McCain has a track record of change - while Obama does not.  The McCain campaign feels it needs to have the voters ask who can be trusted more to get the job done, and if that occurs, then they have the advantage.
With the selection of Palin, and the energy it has brought to the conservative base, McCain has taken to larger rallies, as opposed to town hall meetings and press conferences.  By mid-September, he had gone four weeks without a town hall, and three weeks without a press conference, instead sticking to larger engagements, appearing alongside his vice presidential nominee, with larger crowds than he had experienced earlier in his campaign.

Democratic Strategy
Democrats are confident that the low popularity of President Bush and particularly Operation Iraqi Freedom, which John McCain supports, puts them in a highly favorable position for 2008.  They have been cautious in the Iraq arena realizing that 'The Surge' worked and they were on the wrong end of that issue.  Focus is being put on a timeline for troops coming home, a position that most of the American population favors.
Democrats believe it is their race to lose, but also realize they had a good chance to win the last two Presidential elections and came up short each time.  General wisdom also states that a poor economy favors Obama, so they will emphasize the dire times in this area.  As in past elections, differences between those who have obtained a high income level and those who have not will be emphasized. In fact, the Democratic strategy in many ways mirrors that of their strategy in 1992 when the Democrat-controlled Congress deliberately caused economic disruption, knowing full well that the public would blame sitting president George H.W. Bush, and thereby allowing Bill Clinton to win that year's presidential race.
Favored by the young, Democrats will try hard to encourage and get out the young vote, a task that has proven more difficult than expected in the last two election cycles.  To their advantage, Obama made his vice presidential pick via text message to cell phone numbers registered on the site.  The announcement went to 3 million cell phones, a useful database for ""Get Out The Vote"" (GOTV) efforts, when voters may not be home or reachable on their landline.
As an extension of the DNC's strategy in the 2006 elections, led by Howard Dean, Barack Obama has been working towards a ""50-state strategy.""  The campaign is working to place campaign offices throughout the country with a focus on voter registration.  The increase in the rolls of Democratic voters from the primary battle between Hillary Clinton and Obama played out well for the Democrats and puts pressure on Senator McCain even in typically red states, and more specifically, ""Lean Republican"" states, to use the Cook Political Report's term.  In addition, with a fundraising advantage, Obama is airing ads in those tight states forcing McCain to make decisions about whether to use funds to match ads and campaign efforts in those states or rely on historical results that those states will support him and focus funds in traditional toss-up states instead.

Barack Obama had a significant edge over Hillary Clinton in the fundraising department during their contest for the Democratic nomination, but both actually set records for raising money and both raised far more money than John McCain.  McCain didn't have to spend as much since he locked up the Republican nomination much earlier than Obama locked up the Democratic.  Both Obama and McCain said they would accept government funds—which would also cap how much the candidates could raise on their own—but Obama, who could presumably raise more through his own sources, changed his mind and later declined.  Much of McCain's war chest will come from the Republican Party in general, which has more money to spend than their Democratic counterparts.  McCain's campaign raised $47 million in August, a very sizable figure for him so far and a personal record, but not as strong as Obama's best months. In the same time period, Obama set a record with $66 million. Obama, still having an edge in fundraising that has continued throughout his run for the Presidency, saw $10 million collected the day after Sarah Palin's strongly received convention speech, a new one day record.[7]  The Palin announcement has been good for John McCain's fundraising as well.
Obama set a new record of $150 million raised in September and over $600 million overall.[8]  Obama's camp does not release information on who contributes to the campaign.


Conventions
Democratic National Convention
For a more detailed treatment, see 2008 Democratic National Convention.
The 2008 Democratic National Convention was held in Denver, Colorado, from August 25 to August 27 at Pepsi Center. There, Senator Obama and his running mate were selected to be the party nominee's. Barack Obama will accepted the party's nomination in front of a crowd of more than 75,000 in a free, open event held at INVESCO Field at Mile High, in a platform resemblant to a Greek temple. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is the Permanent Chair of the Convention.
The convention had a rocky start as friction between supporters of Obama and the Clintons was not resolved.  Instead of Obama getting a bump in the polls, his support actually declined.  The Democrats also seemed to be at odds on finding a unifying strategy for how hard to attack John McCain and how to present it.  As Democratic pundit James Carville said in an interview on CNN, ""If this party has a message, it's done a <heck> of a job hiding it tonight, I promise you that.""[9]
A bleak convention was turned around by the Clintons. Infighting between Obama and Hillary continued through the day of her speech, but a comprise was reached, and, beyond expectations, she gave a rousing speech for Obama - possibly as an angry response to McCain's latest ad that showed her 'supporting' him. Bill Clinton the next night also praised Obama, something that he failed to effectively do in 2000 for Al Gore when he centered on his accomplishments and gave little more than lip service to Gore with statements amounting to 'and Al Gore was there too'. The convention, possibly remembering that, gave him the topic he was to speak on instead of choosing his own. Clinton was angered, but it worked. He came through. By the time Obama spoke on the last night, the theme that was missing at first was clear, and Obama mixed a message of attacking McCain with the need for change and even outlining some expensive programs that would appeal to the target populace who has been lukewarm to him. From a political point of view, the convention did what it was supposed to.


Republican National Convention
For a more detailed treatment, see 2008 Republican National Convention.
The 2008 Republican National Convention was held in Saint Paul, Minnesota from September 1 (Labor Day) until September 4. The presumptive nominee was Senator McCain. The location has political significance in that Minnesota will likely be a close state during the general election, as will its neighboring states Wisconsin and Iowa.
The convention schedule had to be altered due to the upcoming landfall of Hurricane Gustav. The first day almost entirely focused on raising money for Hurricane relief.  This led to a shortened three day convention instead of four and there was some shuffling of who was speaking on which day to accommodate the suddenly shortened time span.  In a surprise, George W. Bush was only delivered an eight-minute speech by satellite.  In another surprise Sarah Palin's speech was watched by as many people as saw Obama give his acceptance speech on the closing night of the Democratic convention, as over 40 million people tuned in.[10]  She was considered the highlight of the convention, even surpassing John McCain's speech the next day, and was noted for doing an exceptional job.  Recognizing the strong asset that they have in her, the Republicans made reference to her many times on the last day of the convention.  McCain, not known for being comfortable reading prepared speeches in a convention hall, delivered a solid speech.  While Obama continued to enjoy a lead in the polls, it changed quickly thereafter to a slight McCain-Palin edge.  The Republican convention more than canceled out a very powerful Democratic convention.

Leftist violence
 Poster circulated by community organizers. Other posters depicted rock throwers with the caption, ""Shut Down the RNC!,"" dead elephants, and derogatory and demeaning comments about gay Republicans. [2]
Progressives for Obama shares a huge membership overlap with the Movement for a Democratic Society (MDS), a group of former Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) members and sympathisers. MDS re-founded SDS in 2006 for a new generation of college students and functions as a support group for SDS's 130 college chapters. Independent researcher Trevor Louden refers to MDS as ""the brains behind the SDS brawn.""  The reconstituted SDS was very prominent in the violence at the Republican National Convention at St Paul.[11] The founder of ACORN, Wade Rathke, denouncd[12] an FBI informer who foiled a terrorist plot to kill delegates at the Republican Convention.[13]

Vice Presidential Candidates
Democratic Vice-Presidential Candidate
On August 23, Senator Barack Obama announced, via text message to 3 million cell phone numbers of his supporters, his nomination of Joseph Biden to Vice President.  Biden's selection was considered to be a prudent move by Obama, filling a hole in his own foreign policy experience that McCain could exploit.  With the implosion of John Edwards, Biden was widely expected to be the choice.  In order to help build up suspense, Biden said he was not chosen when he spoke to the press the day before, only to be shown as the Vice Presidential candidate the next day.  A long-term senator and Washington insider with over two decades of service in the Senate, his earlier 1988 plagiarism scandal and frequent gaffes (including one in which he insulted Obama in a racist manner during the 2008 election) were deemed to be less negative than the positive that his strong experience credentials could bring to the race.  

 Joseph Biden




Republican Vice-Presidential Candidate
 thumb
Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska was announced as John McCain's choice early on Friday, August 29, the day after the Democratic convention ended.  A surprise choice not even considered by the press to be on McCain's short list, her selection caught the political world off guard.  It had been expected that Mitt Romney would earn the honor, but McCain had other ideas.  At first denigrated by the people in the Obama campaign, Obama's own statement was one of cautious neutrality to feel out what impact her selection would have on the race.


In an interesting twist, the selection of the Vice Presidential candidates changed the dynamics of the race.  By Obama picking Biden, he helped to fill the hole that McCain had been attacking dealing with a lack of foreign policy experience.  McCain's strongest point, experience, would lose some of its luster.  But the selection of Biden, and the passing over of Hillary Clinton, left another opening.  By aligning himself with someone who has been a Democratic stalwart, Obama's claim to change became less pronounced.  McCain seized upon that to select a Vice President that no one expected, and a woman, and steal some of the Democratic thunder.  Her lack of foreign policy experience would cut into the experience angle that had been in play earlier, but her own maverick streak in becoming governor by ousting another Republican, combined with John McCain's maverick choice in selecting her led to a new emphasis on McCain's own maverick past. Palin arguably had more ""executive"" / managerial experience than either McCain, Biden or, notably, Obama.  Suddenly he saw an opportunity to steal the moniker of change that Obama had been wearing, and he went for it.  Such a change in position occurring from the Vice Presidential selection is rare in Presidential politics.

Debates
Presidential Debates
For a more detailed treatment, see 2008 Presidential Debates.
There have been three presidential debates for the 2008 election season.  The first debate on September 26 discussed ""Foreign Policy & National Security"" and also dealt at length with the economic crisis. The result was a statistical draw where both candidates did better than expected in the eyes of the public.  The longer term impact worked out well for Obama who already had a lead going in, and benefited from solidifying that position.
The second debate on October 7, followed a town hall-style.  The questions came from audience members and the Internet, as chosen by the moderator.  Again the result was a statistical draw as far as who was considered to be the winner.  But with time running out for McCain, he needed something to make the people move his way, and that required a clear breakthrough that never happened
The final debate was held on October 15 concerned ""Domestic and Economic Policy."" Both candidates were again viewed as having done well, which was a tactical defeat for McCain as the poll numbers showed only small changes.

Vice Presidential Debate
There was one vice presidential debate held on October 2.  Palin did much better than expected, but Biden was also in top form.  No clear winner emerged and the poll numbers remained largely unchanged, a strategic win for the Democratic ticket that only had to maintain their lead to win the election.  The number of people who watched the debate was an alltime record for a Vice Presidential debate, and was viewed by more people than any of the three Presidential debates.

Third parties and Independents
As usual there were a number of third party candidates, but none made much of an impact.  Briefly the Libertarian Bob Barr had enough strength to become a spoiler for McCain.  He faded quickly. See United States Presidential Election, 2008 -- Third Party Candidates.

Primaries
For expanded primary information, see United States Presidential Election, 2008 - Primaries
The primary season for both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party officially began on January 3, 2008 with the Iowa Caucuses and ended on June 3, 2008.[14]  The 2008 election cycle saw a major shift in the primary election calendar, frontloading many primaries into early February.[15]
John McCain had to get his footing at first, but was pretty much assured the Republican nomination after Super Tuesday.  Barack Obama had a much tougher road, but rode out a string of victories in February to eventually outlast Clinton and take the nomination.  During that time he had raised more money than any other candidate in history giving him a huge boost, a trend that would continue into the general election.

Nineteen Eighty-Four


  First edition cover


 Author 
George Orwell


 Year Published 
1949


 Language 
English


Nineteen Eighty-Four (often republished as 1984) [1] 
is a dystopian novel by George Orwell about the excesses of totalitarian regimes and especially of Stalinist communism. 
The book's working title was The Last Man in Europe, but it was changed at the publisher's suggestion.[2]
Orwell was influenced by the ideas of the American conservative James Burnham's book The Managerial Revolution,[3] which contains many of the same themes.  This helped to shape the political situation described in 1984.  Orwell also found influence in Jack London's novel The Iron Heel, and Yevgeny Zamyatin's We.  
Though Orwell was deeply critical of communism, it is debatable whether 1984 was intended as a condemnation of all forms of socialism.  Orwell denied attacking socialism but that may have been essential self-preservation for a writer in the pro-socialism climate in Britain at the time. On the other hand, it is possible that Orwell, being acutely aware of the promotion of liberalism by large corporations in crony capitalist environments, believed that a form of socially conservative limited socialism was the best way to prevent the further erosion of freedom and traditional values.  Orwell wrote, in response to critics: ""My recent novel [Nineteen Eighty-Four] is NOT intended as an attack on Socialism or on the British Labour Party (of which I am a supporter) but as a show-up of the perversions ... which have already been partly realized in Communism and Fascism. ...The scene of the book is laid in Britain in order to emphasize that the English-speaking races are not innately better than anyone else and that totalitarianism, if not fought against, could triumph anywhere.""[4]  1984 has a conservative message, and was influenced by the work of Burnham.
The book is, at its heart, a condemnation of the ultra-liberal menace that arose and threatened Europe during his time. The fictional Oceanic dictatorship is the logical extreme of the liberal attitude towards government Orwell saw creeping in around him, both at home and abroad. The breakdown and perversion of home and family ties, the eradication of religion to make room for secular cult worship, the manipulation of language and history to suit the agenda of the day, and the use of deliberate economic strangulation in order to ensure compliance in the population were all tactics that Orwell predicted would come into play should an ultra-liberal government arise. One need only examine the regimes of Stalin and Kim Jong Il to see examples of Orwell-type dictatorships; atheism and state-worship forcibly substituted for religion, the deliberate starvation of all but the most elite members of society, even Orwell's nightmarish vision of sons spying on their parents for the state came true in the Soviet Union, and still persists in North Korea. Thus he uses the book to attack the intrusiveness and arrogance of big government.
Despite it condemning totalitarian-style governments, however, some leftists often use the book as a means to promote the exact same hard left policies that Orwell himself tried to condemn, even using the book's descriptions to condemn traditional governments as being ""authoritarian"" while promoting groups and concepts that were far closer in nature of the Oceanic dictatorship in the book. Examples of this include George Lucas, who claimed he was ""a 1984 kind of guy"" as well as being self-described as anti-authoritarian, yet at the same time had no qualms with supporting the Vietcong and basing the Rebels on them (with full awareness that the Vietcong were a terrorist group in reality)[5] while basing the Empire on America; as well as the Wachowskis, who used symbolism for the book in the Matrix trilogy for the Machines, and in particular Agent Smith, yet had no qualms depicting the heroes as nihilistic terrorists.

Plot Summary
In the world of Nineteen Eighty-Four, individual, free nations no longer exist; the world has been divided up into three massive empire-states: Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia.  Religion is not mentioned in the book and is speculated to have been stamped out. A worship of Big Brother, similar to Juche, is imposed as an alternative.
Oceania is, roughly, the English-speaking world: the United States, Canada, Britain, Australia, and South Africa. It is perpetually at war with either Eurasia or Eastasia, and allied with the other. The book describes a hyper-liberal dystopia where the government, known as the Party, monitors and controls nearly all aspects of every individual's life. Extreme liberal fanaticism and ignorance are promoted by Oceania through relentless propaganda. This is practiced to the point that citizens unthinkingly (or, in Newspeak, use bellyfeel) accept everything said and done by the Party, and hate everything associated with the empire-state which happens to the enemy at the moment. Relationships among people, whether platonic or intimate, are discouraged or sometimes forbidden outright, as they distract from worship of the leader, Big Brother (who may or may not exist).  It is later revealed that in reality all three empire-states have the same government and are essentially identical in their pursuit of a liberal, pagan social system.  
The protagonist, Winston Smith, works in the Ministry of Truth, a department of the Oceanian government altering records to fit the Party's current version of history. However, Smith gradually grows to disagree with the Party and what it stands for. Julia, a woman who also works in the Ministry of Truth and ostensibly a member of the Junior Anti-Sex League, becomes Winston's lover, and after meeting in several different places, they finally rent an upstairs room in a prole shop. However, the owner of the shop turns out to be an agent of the Thought Police and Winston and Julia are captured by the thought police right in their room, brought to the Ministry of Love, and tortured to the point where they once again love the Party.
Much of the novel is taken up with discussions of the nature of power and societal control, and words and mottoes from the novel – ""doublethink"", ""We have always been at war with Eastasia"", ""the memory hole"" and many more – have become standard shorthand in political discussions, while terms such as ""thought police"", ""Room 101"" and ""Big Brother"" have entered the language.

Background of Novel
The environmental background to the action of the story is a satirical portrayal of late-1940s London, a city where war damage was still very evident, and rationing and shortages a way of life. The Ministry of Truth, as described by Orwell in the novel, is based upon the Senate House building of London University, at the time one of the tallest buildings in the capital, and home during the Second World War to the Ministry of Information.

Governmental Structure
The structure of government in Oceania is sharply pyramidal; the mythical, probably non-existent Big Brother rests forever at the top of the pyramid, followed by the ruling Inner Party consisting of around six million people, or 2% of Oceania's population. Then follows the Outer Party, who serve the Inner Party, making up 15% and lastly the ""proles,"" or the Proletariat, who make up, according to the novel, the remaining 85% of the population. Since Big Brother is probably only a personification of government, it is really the Inner Party which rules Oceania, making it an oligarchy. Goldstein's book refers to the system as ""Oligarchical Collectivism.""  Conservative commentators have noted that the system Orwell describes seems like a parody of the worst aspects of liberalism.
The government is horribly inefficient in all things except constant and oppressive surveillance over Party members. The proles are considered mindless and unimportant, and so are allowed to go free, kept occupied by trashy entertainment known in Newspeak as prolefeed. This is one of Orwell's many swipes at the news and entertainment industry, which was a haven for liberals even in the 1940s. Orwell once remarked that  ""no event is ever correctly reported in a newspaper,""[6] and he was a known critic of the arts and television, which he considered to be a tool of the elite to spread liberalism and take the world towards a Big Brother-type society.
The entire aparatus of the Oceanic government is divided between four ministries:

 The Ministry of Truth (Minitrue, in Newspeak), which is concerned with fictionalized news reports, worthless entertainment, propaganda, the fine arts, and, mostly important of all, rewriting history so that the historical record always supports the Party. (Winston Smith, the main character, works here.) 
 The Ministry of Peace (Minipax, in Newspeak), which is concerned with waging an eternal war against Eurasia or Eastasia (whichever it is at the time) to destroy all surplus production and therefore maintain the political structure of Oceanic society.
 The Ministry of Love (Miniluv, in Newspeak), which is tasked with discovering, capturing, torturing, and ultimately brainwashing thought criminals through the Thought Police. The novel describes this ministry as being the most terrifying, as it has no windows and is surrounded by barbed wire entanglements, hidden machine guns, and gorilla-faced guards armed with joined truncheons.
 The Ministry of Plenty (Miniplenty, in Newspeak), which is responsible for Oceania's planned economy (systematic starvation).
Note that all of these names are quite ironic: 

 The Ministry of Truth, or Minitrue, in newspeak, is in fact a ministry of lies, where the Party maintains control over newspapers, television and historical records in a never-ending race to edit the past to conform to the attitudes of the present. This campaign of historical revisionism, usually the provenance of academics trying to ""uncover"" new information, is performed here by an army of Party members who knowingly edit the truth and fabricate people, dates and events whole cloth. By systematically changing what records state, so that never, is the party seen as wrong. Ironically, the Ministry of truth, is indeed spreading truth, if the past only exists in records, and memory, and all who hold that memory will cease to hold it.
The Ministry of Plenty rations almost all food and drink, with the notable exception of cheap ""Victory Gin."" Orwell was very insightful to note the connection between heavy alcohol use and compliance to the whims of a totalitarian state, where the government is the only source of food and money for the population. All other food products are of poor quality, made in government-owned factories that are constantly behind on schedule because of the (intentional) inefficiency of the government-run industries in Oceania. Orwell was almost eerily prescient to have had this insight, as in the following years Stalin proved just how far a totalitarian would go to starve his people into compliance. The ministry of Truth is behind the misinformation, that plagues the Ministry of Plenty's output quotas, by blatantly lying about how much is actually produced.
The Ministry of Peace conducts perpetual war, but intentionally sabotages its own forces so that the government can keep the people of Oceania in a state of fear. This state of fear makes it easier for the Big Brother government to control the populace and cement their dependency on the ""generosity"" of the Party. In the book, Smith postulates that the rocket bombs dropped daily on Airstrip One are not enemy weapons, but a false flag operation by the government of Oceania to justify their continued state of paranoia and economic stagnation. Also ironically, in Newspeak, the Ministry of Peace is indeed the force behind peace, as explained in Goldstien's book.
The Ministry of Love, or MiniLuv deals with those who don't love Big Brother. Another insight of Orwell's is the sinister redefinition of the word love, from traditional definitions to ones decided on by the Party. The Party's meddling in the bonds of family leads to a population almost completely ignorant of anything resembling real love. The Ministry is in charge of correcting the thoughts of citizens who fall outside of the political orthodoxy of the Party's Big Brother ideology. This comes in forms both small and large, from chastising a person through the television screen for not exercising enough, to murdering a man for speaking in his sleep. Also ironically, the Ministry of Love, does indeed bring love, by rewriting the memories of the unfortunate within, so that they will love the Party and Big Brother. As postulated by Goldstien's book, the Ministry of Love prevents martyrs, because nobody truly hates the Party, after the Ministry of Love is through with them.

1965 Voting Rights Act,https://www.conservapedia.com/1965_Voting_Rights_Act,"The National Voting Rights Act of 1965[1] authorized, and in some areas required, federal oversight of elections and election laws. Many (but not all) of these areas were in the South, which was at that time controlled by the Democratic Party. The Act gave the Department of Justice the power to approve or reject any change in a voting law in certain districts where less than 50% of the population were registered to vote in 1964. 
Sections 2 and 5 are the most important parts of the Voting Rights Act.  Section 2 prohibits racial discrimination in elections nationwide, and is relatively non-controversial.  But Section 5 imposes ""temporary"" restrictions on certain ""covered"" regions that require those regions (9 states, mostly in the South, are covered in whole, and another 7 states are covered in part) to obtain pre-clearance by the federal government for any changes in election procedures.  This ""temporary"" restriction was intended to last only five years, but has been repeatedly been extended, most recently in 2006 for another 25 years.
Section 4 provides the formula for which jurisdictions are covered by Section 5.  The formula was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013 in the case Shelby County v. Holder.
The Act also outlawed literacy tests.

History
The Act was passed by the U.S. Congress over strong opposition within the Democratic Party. President Lyndon Johnson asked Republican Minority Leader Everett Dirksen for help [2] in breaking the Democratic filibuster. Dirksen spoke on the Senate floor,



 “

 The time has come for equality of opportunity in sharing of government, in education, and in employment. It must not be stayed or denied. It is here!

 ”


Under Johnson, the Senate had not been able to muster enough votes to cut off a filibuster on a Civil Rights Bill. With Republican support, the final count showed 44 Democrats and 27 Republicans voting to end the filibuster, with 23 Democrats and only 6 Republicans opposed. The formal Senate vote on the bill took place on June 19, 1964. It passed overwhelmingly, 73-27. 
The final Senate vote on August 4 was 49 Democrats and 30 Republicans in favor, one Republican and 17 Democrats opposed. Segregationists who voted against the Voting Rights Act were J. William Fulbright,[3] awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Bill Clinton, and Al Gore, Sr., father of Democratic Presidential Nominee Al Gore.

Voting Rights Act results by party
The two numbers in each line of this list refer to the number of representatives voting in favor and against the act, respectively.
Senate: 77–19
Democrats: 47–17 (73%-27%)
Republicans: 30–2 (94%-6%)
House: 333–85
Democrats: 221–61 (78%-22%)
Republicans: 112–24 (82%-18%)

Clinton era violations of the Voting Rights Act
In December 1989 a three-judge district federal court found that Bill Clinton had violated the Voting Rights Act.  The Supreme Court upheld the findings of fact in Clinton vs Jeffers [4] that the Arkansas governor and future Democratic president violated the Voting Rights Act. The Supreme Court Justices wrote,



 “

 Bill Clinton does not dispute here -- that violations of the fourteenth or fifteenth amendment justifying equitable relief have occurred in Arkansas.  In May 1990, the district court turned to those claims, holding that ""the State of Arkansas has committed a number of constitutional violations of the voting rights of black citizens."" J.S. App. A5. In particular, the court determined that the ""State has systematically and deliberately enacted new majority-vote requirements for municipal offices, in an effort to frustrate black political success in elections traditionally requiring only a plurality to win.""  In 1990...Devotion to majority rule for local offices lay dormant as long as the plurality system produced white office-holders. But whenever black candidates used this system successfully -- and victory by a plurality has been virtually their only chance of success in at-large elections in majority-white cities – the response was swift and certain. Laws were passed in an attempt to close off this avenue of black political victory.

 ”


The court concluded these series of laws passed under Clinton



 “

 represents a systematic and deliberate attempt to reduce black political opportunity. Such an attempt is plainly unconstitutional. It replaces a system in which blacks could and did succeed, with one in which they almost certainly cannot.

 ”


And most pointedly the 



 “

 inference of racial motivation is inescapable.

 ”


Renewal
Although the Act is over 40 years old and addresses issues from the early 1960s and before, in 2006 Congress passed a 25-year extension after holding many hearings and collecting over 12000 pages of evidence.[5]  33 House members opposed the 25-year extension, primarily because of the imposition of multilingual balloting.  Not a single senator, however, voted against it, and President George W. Bush signed it into law.
The law now imposes a complex system of regulations that include forcing local governments to print multilingual ballots at their own expense, in many different foreign languages.
In recent years it has enabled liberals in Washington, D.C. to block reforms such as voter ID sought by local jurisdictions in 16 states.  However, it should be noted that Georgia's voter ID law was precleared and that a three-judge panel allowed South Carolina's voter ID law to take effect (albeit modified by a state interpretation during the trial).[6]  The entire State of Texas was subjected to ongoing federal control of its elections until it successfully bails out of being a covered jurisdiction in part because Texas once printed its ballots in English rather than Spanish.  Texas has also had more objections to changes in its voting procedures from 1966 to 2004 than any other covered state.[7]

Private cause of action
Citizens can file civil suits under the Voting Rights Act. On February 6, 2015, three African-American citizens filed a suit against the Democratic Party of Virginia because the party used a ""fire house"" primary/unassembled caucus to select its nominee for a special election to fill a vacancy in the House of Delegates created by the resignation of Joseph D. “Joe” Morrissey.  Morrissey resigned after he was convicted of taking liberties with a female staff member.  The party decided to allow only the 50 voting committee members living in that district to pick a candidate instead of a process that would allow all registered voters to participate.  A majority of voters in the district are African- Americans.  As a result, the party selected a candidate other than Morrissey, who ran as an independent.  Morrissey won the election, and is now serving on a daily release from his prison cell. The suit alleges a Voting Rights Act violation.[8]

The 1948 Arab-Israeli War, referred to as the War of Independence (מלחמת השחרור) by Israelis, and The Catastrophe (""al Nakba"", النكبة) by Arabs, where some 700,000 Palestinians were expelled from their homeland, was the first armed conflict fought by the modern state of Israel, with a total population of approximately 600,000, against the armies of the Arab nations of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and other Arab militias.  About 6,000 Israelis died in the war, or fully one percent of the population, but the war ended in 1949 with a United Nations-brokered armistice.  As a result of the war, Israel grew by some 50% over the original Partition of British Palestine.  Some 800,000 Jews were expelled from neighboring Arab states and allowed to settle in Israel.

"""Oceanic"" Volcanoes",https://www.conservapedia.com/%22Oceanic%22_Volcanoes,"In a typical ""oceanic"" environment, volcanoes are aligned along the crest of a broad ridge that marks an active fracture system in the oceanic crust. Basaltic magma, generated in the upper mantle beneath the ridge, rise along fractures through the basaltic layer. Because the granitic crustal layer is absent, the magma are not appreciably modified or changed in composition and they erupt on the surface to form basaltic volcanoes.[1]

1983 United States Embassy bombing,https://www.conservapedia.com/1983_United_States_Embassy_bombing," 
The 1983 United States Embassy bombing (April 18, 1983) was a terrorist attack on a United States embassy compound in Beirut, Lebanon, believed to have been coordinated by Imad Mughniyah. The attack was propagated by a truck bomb, carrying close to one ton of explosives.[1]  Sixty-three people, including the CIA's Middle East director, were killed, and 120 were injured.
The bombing was provoked by US intervention in the 1982 Lebanese Civil War.  In 2003, a U.S. District court judge ruled that the attack was carried out by members of Hezbollah.[2]

1

Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.






2

And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.






3

And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.






4

And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.






5

And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.






6

And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go.






7

Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?






8

And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.






9

(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)






10

Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was.






11

And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?






12

And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:






13

As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him.






14

And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place.






15

Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,






16

To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.






17

And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people.






18

Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is.






19

And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart.






20

And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's house?






21

And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?






22

And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons.






23

And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.






24

And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left! set it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.






25

And when they were come down from the high place into the city, Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house.






26

And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.






27

And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.

Analysis


1

Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance?






2

When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?






3

Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:






4

And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hands.






5

After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:






6

And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.






7

And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.






8

And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do.






9

And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.






10

And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.






11

And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?






12

And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?






13

And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.






14

And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that they were no where, we came to Samuel.






15

And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you.






16

And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not.






17

And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;






18

And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you:






19

And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands.






20

And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.






21

When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.






22

Therefore they inquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the stuff.






23

And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.






24

And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.






25

Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.






26

And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.






27

But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no presents. But he held his peace.

1

Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh-gilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.






2

And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.






3

And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days' respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel: and then, if there be no man to save us, we will come out to thee.






4

Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept.






5

And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh.






6

And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly.






7

And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.






8

And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.






9

And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, To morrow, by that time the sun be hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came and shewed it to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.






10

Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.






11

And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together.






12

And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.






13

And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel.






14

Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.






15

And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.

1

And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you.






2

And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day.






3

Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it you.






4

And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand.

And he said unto them, The LORD is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found ought in my hand. And they answered, He is witness.






6

And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.






7

Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers.






8

When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.






9

And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.






10

And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.






11

And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe.






12

And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God was your king.






13

Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have desired! and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you.






14

If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your God:






15

But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers.






16

Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes.






17

Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the LORD, and he shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king.






18

So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.






19

And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.






20

And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart;






21

And turn ye not aside: for then should ye go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.






22

For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people.






23

Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:






24

Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you.






25

But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king.

1

Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,






2

Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.






3

And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.






4

And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.






5

And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Beth-aven.






6

When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.






7

And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.






8

And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.






9

And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.






10

And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.






11

And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;






12

Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.






13

And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.






14

But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee.






15

And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.






16

And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.






17

And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:






18

And another company turned the way to Beth-horon: and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.






19

Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:






20

But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.






21

Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.






22

So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.






23

And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.

1

Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side. But he told not his father.






2

And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;






3

And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, I-chabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.






4

And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.






5

The forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.






6

And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.






7

And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.






8

Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will discover ourselves unto them.






9

If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.






10

But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign unto us.






11

And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.






12

And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.






13

And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him.






14

And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.






15

And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.






16

And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.






17

Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there.






18

And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.






19

And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.






20

And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.






21

Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.






22

Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.






23

So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Beth-aven.






24

And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted any food.






25

And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground.






26

And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.






27

But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.






28

Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day. And the people were faint.






29

Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.






30

How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?






31

And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint.






32

And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood.






33

Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.






34

And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.






35

And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD.






36

And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.






37

And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.






38

And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.






39

For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.






40

Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.






41

Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.






42

And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.






43

Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die.






44

And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.






45

And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.






46

Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.






47

So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them.






48

And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.






49

Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchi-shua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:






50

And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.






51

And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.






52

And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.

1

Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD.






2

Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.






3

Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.






4

And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.






5

And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.






6

And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.






7

And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt.






8

And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.






9

But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.






10

Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,






11

It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night.






12

And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.






13

And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.






14

And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?






15

And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.






16

Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.






17

And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel?






18

And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.






19

Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?






20

And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.






21

But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.






22

And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.






23

For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.






24

And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.






25

Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD.






26

And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.






27

And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.






28

And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is better than thou.






29

And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.






30

Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.






31

So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.






32

Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.






33

And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.






34

Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.






35

And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.

1992 Presidential election,https://www.conservapedia.com/1992_Presidential_election," Bill Clinton and George H. W. Bush In the 1992 presidential election, President George H. W. Bush stood for reelection.  He had received strong support for the way he had handled foreign relations during his term in office, but the economy had slumped.  Bush had the confidence of the Republican Party, which nominated him for reelection after he easily brushed aside a campaign by Pat Buchanan.  
The Democrats, after a more protracted primary season, nominated young Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, as their candidate. Clinton and his wife Hillary Rodham Clinton who promised ""two for the price of one"" perpetrated a myth that he was a Rhodes Scholar and she a ""defender of children"".[1]
Wealthy oil-businessman named Ross Perot also ran as an independent bringing together a new Reform Party. The candidates appeared in several live televised Presidential Debates, which included not only the two major party candidates but also the sometimes quirky, but very charismatic, Perot who proved to have a ""folksy"" delivery that gave him a strong following. Clinton won a majority of the Electoral College despite receiving only a plurality of the popular vote after Perot was able to garner almost 20% of the vote.

Campaign
Bush enjoyed historically high approval ratings after his decisive military victory in Operation Desert Storm in 1991, but that had evaporated by the time of the election. Ironically, the fall of the Berlin Wall and collapse of the Soviet Union under Bush's Presidency hurt him in his reelection campaign in that it resulted in foreign policy not being a prominent issue, with no Soviet threat. The campaign focused almost entirely on domestic concerns and an economy that was believed to still be in a recession.
A prominently placed sign in Clinton's campaign headquarters read ""It’s the economy, stupid!"" Bill Clinton ran a different, more youthful campaign, by making frequent appearances on MTV and daytime talk-shows, and took questions from live audiences, which proved to be a comfortable setting for him. He distanced himself from past Democratic Party candidates like George McGovern, Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis, by running as a centrist. He cited the ticket's support of the death penalty, a balanced budget, middle class tax cuts and a desire to ""end welfare as we know it.""  Clinton had baggage of avoiding the Vietnam War, illegally failing to report for the draft, and past drug use, but the mainstream media didn't push those themes.
According to Wikipedia, Bill Clinton engaged in voter suppression by appearing at several Massachusetts polling locations, which caused voters hours of delay and inhibited traffic.[2] Clinton was allegedly electioneering within 150 feet of the polling locations, which is also illegal according to Massachusetts state law.[3]
George H. W. Bush trailed in the polls for the entire campaign. Several of his speeches and political ads focused on the Gulf War, fall of the Berlin Wall and experience to illustrate his success as commander in chief, but his message did little to help his standing.  
Bush was widely blamed for a downturn in the economy that did not actually happen.[4] Worse, he was held responsible by conservative voters for reneging on his pledge, ""Read my lips—no new taxes"". He agreed to a major tax hike. More moderate and less charismatic than Reagan, Bush had no personal following could do little to find an issue to energize his party or the American people.  In the debates he stressed the idea of the American people giving him a Republican Congress to work with, which at the time seemed out of touch as the Democrats enjoyed large leads in both the House and the Senate.  His campaign never caught fire.  Attempts to paint Clinton as a tax-and-spend liberal governor with no foreign policy experience didn't resonate. Bush never found a way to deal with Perot.
In Ross Perot's surprisingly strong third-party campaign he ran as a crusading expert—a successful businessman—who was qualified to fix the economy and the huge federal budget deficits. Perot argued that deficits were a kind of corruption, and represented a failure that could no longer be tolerated. He damaged the Bush campaign by asserting that the economy was worse than it was and giving disenchanted voters who didn't want to support Clinton a protest vote.

Analysis
The 1992 election was unique for a number of reasons: a perception that economic conditions were worse than they actually were, which harmed incumbent President Bush; a strong third-party candidate in Perot who won over alienated conservatives by arguing 12 years of Republican rule had only raised the deficit; and, perhaps most importantly, Bill Clinton's ability to unite not only the Democratic Party, but a number of heterogeneous coalitions, much as Franklin Roosevelt, also a consummate politician, did in the New Deal Coalition after 1932.[6]

"""Hallelujah""",https://www.conservapedia.com/%22Hallelujah%22,"""Hallelujah"" is a song written and originally performed by the Canadian singer song writer Leonard Cohen.  It has been covered by several other singers (e.g., Sheryl Crowe, Bob Dylan) and appeared on the sound tracks of popular movies like the cartoon Shrek (performed by John Cale in the movie and by Rufus Wainwright on the soundtrack album).  The winner of the 2008 X factor (British version of American Idol) Alexandra Burke performed ""Hallelujah"" in her finale.
The song's first set of lyrics is



 “

 Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah

2001: A Space Odyssey,https://www.conservapedia.com/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey,"2001: A Space Odyssey is a 1968 film directed by Stanley Kubrick and based on a 1950 short story by Arthur C. Clarke called ""The Sentinel"". 
The film takes as its theme the idea that human evolution has been guided by aliens, and that with the advent of manned space travel we have developed the maturity as a race to directly encounter this guiding entity for the first time.
The opening scene takes place in Africa at the dawn of mankind, where groups of ape-like creatures fight for food and survival.  A large, black, rectangular monolith appears, and stimulates the intellectual abilities of some of the apes, who are then inspired to use bones as tools.  The transition of some apes into tool-users marked the beginning of the development of man, and set the stage for what was to come.
The story transitions to 2001, where explorers on the moon had investigated a strange radio source, and uncover a similar monolith that had apparently been buried there for millions of years.  After being unearthed, this monolith emits new radio beacon aimed at Jupiter, so an expedition is mounted to investigate the target of the transmission.
The remainder of the film deals with the voyage of the ship Discovery to Jupiter.  During the trip, the two astronauts actively manning the ship begin to suspect that their artificial intelligence support computer, named HAL, is malfunctioning.  HAL begins to exhibit paranoid behavior as its actions are questions, and attacks the crew in apparent self-defense.  HAL is disabled, and the sole surviving astronaut arrives at Jupiter to find a significantly larger monolith in orbit around the planet.  He takes a shuttle-pod and lands on the surface of the monolith, at which point he undergoes a strange, hallucinatory transformation and is reborn as a god-like, embryonic entity referred to as the ""Star Child"".

Significance
The film is considered a classic of the science fiction genre for several reasons.  Most notably, it was the most realistic depiction of space travel in cinema to that date.  Meticulous detail was put into the design and filming of the spacecraft, whose actions were realistic (no sounds in space, and their movements followed the laws of physics).  Interior spaceflight sequences were captured imaginatively, particularly the zero-G environments on the various ships.
The film is also regarded as being art-like, with its use of classical music in the soundtrack to set mood, and the lack of a specific narrative allowing each viewer to interpret the story in their own way.

 Blood running down the steps of a Jewish home; an American journalist who arrived within hours of the massacre described the scene as a ""slaughterhouse.""
The Hebron Massacre (sometimes referred to as the Hebron Pogrom) took place in Hebron, Palestine in 1929. It began when a yeshiva student named Shmuel Rosenholtz, was attacked by an Arab mob and stabbed to death. Only one British policeman guarded the entire city.[1] By the time British reinforcements arrived to restore order, 67 Jews had been slaughtered and many others seriously wounded. Babies had been beheaded, rabbis castrated, and others raped, tortured and mutilated; hands and fingers were cut off both the living and the dead, apparently for jewelry.[2][3][4]

Background
Hebron (Hebrew: חֶבְרוֹן Hevron ""to be joined"") is the second holiest city after Jerusalem in Judaism. Although small in 1929 (around 100 Jewish families, among an Arab population of 60,000)[5] the Jewish community had lived alongside the Arabs there for centuries. The Sephardi Jews spoke Arabic and many of their Arab neighbours conversed with the Ashkenazi Jews in Yiddish.[6] During the summer of 1929, however, the Islamic Grand Mufti of Jerusalem and head of the Supreme Muslim Council, Haj Amin al-Husseini, began to agitate the Arabs to riot against the Jewish community, distributing leaflets and stirring up anti-Jewish sentiment. Among these were leaflets stating that the Jews were planning to take over the al-Aqsa Mosque.[7] Another stated: ""Hearts are in tumult because of these barbaric deeds, and the people began to break out in shouts of 'war, Jihad... rebellion.'... O Arab nation, the eyes of your brothers in Palestine are upon you... and they awaken your religious feelings and national zealotry to rise up against the enemy who violated the honor of Islam and raped the women and murdered widows and babies."" The Jews had killed no-one, and had attacked no-one.[8] Pierre van Paassen, the international correspondent for the New York Evening World, met with the Mufti around this time and described him as a man driven by a petrifying rage against Jews. During this meeting the Mufti also claimed that Albert Einstein planned to have the Dome of the Rock demolished to make way for a giant synagogue.[9][10]  Al-Husseini had been appointed mufti by Herbert Samuel, the first high commissioner of Palestine, despite his conviction and ten-year prison sentence for inciting earlier anti-Jewish riots in 1920. Al-Husseini had fled capture however, and become a fugitive in Transjordan. It seems that he struck a deal with the British shortly afterwards, using his influence to end riots in 1921. He assured Samuel that he would continue to maintain order, and it was with this understanding that the high commissioner granted him amnesty and the position of Mufti.[11]

First disturbances
Arab abuse against the Jews became a daily occurrence, and complaints were made to the British police that they were not doing anything to protect them. There are many indications that the British authorities had advance warning of the disturbances, yet did nothing to try to head them off.  Journalist/author Shlomo Hersh details[12] several eyewitness accounts of the events leading up to the Hebron massacre which bear this out.

Dr. Elkana of Hebron: ""For many days before the horror began, the poison of incitement was felt everywhere. The Arabs spoke openly, shamelessly, and fearlessly of the massacre of the Jews to be arranged in the near future. They did not hesitate to reveal their whole detailed plan. Facts and evidence are in the hands of the survivors. The landlord of the Hotel, Nachman Segal, said to the lessee of the hotel on Thursday: 'Pay me the rent today, because tomorrow no one among you will be saved.'""[13] 
An unidentified Jewish resident of Hebron: ""At about half past two on Friday August 23 we saw a young Arab arrive by motorcycle from Jerusalem. He alarmed the Arab inhabitants of Hebron, saying that the blood of thousands of Moslems in Jerusalem was being shed like water. He called to the Arabs to avenge this blood. The unrest among the Arabs of Hebron was very strong, particularly after the motor cars began to arrive from Jerusalem with news of disturbances.""[14] 
Davar newspaper, August 20, 1929: ""Incitement of feeling against the Jews goes on, particularly round Jerusalem and Hebron. Rumors are being spread by unknown persons that on Saturday last the Jews cursed the Moslem religion and that it is the duty of Moslems to take revenge.""[15]
From the Memorial Book of the Jewish Community of Hebron:  ""On Friday morning, the day of the outbreak in Jerusalem, the Jews of Hebron were already alarmed. The day before, Aref el-Aref, Arab Governor of Be'ersheva, had been in the City and had preached in the Mosque (Ha' Machpelah). His words were repeated to the Jews; in the midst of open incitement to riot recurred those familiar and sinister words: 'The Government is with us!'[16] The visit of Aref el-Aref to Hebron on Thursday bore very early fruit. On Friday morning the Jews of Hebron received, from an Arab source, the news that the Arabs were arming. Rabbi Ya'acov Slonim, head of the Sephardic Jewish community, and Rabbi Frank, head of the Ashkenazic community, turned to the Arab Governor of Hebron, Abdullah Kardos. The Governor calmed us and said: 'There is no fear of anything happening. The British Government knows what it has to do. In the place where two soldiers are needed, it sends six.' And he added: 'I tell you in confidence that they have many soldiers in the streets, in civilian clothes; these soldiers circulate among the crowds, and in the hour of need they will fulfill their duty.'""[17]
Van Paassen writes that the Acting High Commissioner, despite giving a public statement that the government had been completely taken unawares, had in fact ordered the various hospitals, including the Rothschild clinic of which Van Pasassen's close friend Dr. Dantziger was chief surgeon, a full ten days earlier ""to have a large number of beds in readiness in view of the government's expectation of a riotous outbreak.""[18]
On August 20, members of Haganah (Hebrew: ההגנה The Defense; the Jewish paramilitary defence militia) visited Hebron to offer safe evacuation for the Jewish community, or to provide weapons for self-defense. The community were convinced that the violence would not be allowed to escalate further by the local Arab head men, and declined both offers. They considered their relations with their Arab neighbors to be strong, based upon years of friendship and shared experiences. They did however arrange for the Jewish families living in the outlying areas to be bought to homes in the city center, where they believed they would be at less risk.[19]

August 23
Thousands of Arab villagers travelled into Jerusalem from the outlying villages, ostensibly to pray on the Temple Mount, but armed with staves, swords and knives. acting high commissioner Harry Luke first requested reinforcements from Amman early that morning. None arrived. The entire British military presence in Palestine consisted of less than 100 soldiers and six armoured cars; the entire strength of the Palestine Police was only 175 British officers and 1,500 constables, the majority of whom were Arabs. Following Friday prayers and the usual inflammatory sermons in the mosques, the Arabs poured out into the streets of Jerusalem and proceeded to murder and loot. At about the same time, Arab notables again reassured the Jewish community in Hebron that no harm would come to them.[20]
By the time the riots were over in Jerusalem on August 24, 17 Jews were dead. The British policemen did not at first open fire on the Arabs however, for fear of the crowds turning their anger towards them. The Jews were left undefended at the mercy of the mobs.[21] Near Jerusalem, the small town of Motza was attacked by Arabs who killed every member of the Makleff family except one, a very young boy, Mordechai Makleff,[22] who hid under a bed.[23] The worst fury of the Arabs, however, was directed at Hebron.

The Hebron massacre
On the afternoon of the August 23, an Arab mob broke into the Yeshiva, and killed the only student who had remained there, Shmuel Rozenholtz,[24] a conscientious, young yeshivah bachur who had prepared for Shabbat early and had gone to the yeshivah to review the parashah. As the Arabs made their way back through the streets, an Arab who had participated in the murder of Rosenholtz boasted, ""Too bad we found only one boy. Tomorrow the number will be higher.""
Although there were no further killings that night, the Jews were besieged in groups of up to 40 people scattered around homes in the city center. Shortly after 8am on August 24, frenzied Arab mobs, with axes, knives and iron bars, screamed, ""Kill the Jews!"" They broke into the homes where the Jews were sheltering and stabbed and mutilated everyone they found they found. The mob that rampaged through the city included respected Arab merchants and ""good neighbors"" who killed their friends, clients and business associates.[25]
When the massacre began, the Palestinian Police presence in Hebron consisted of 18 mounted police and 15 on foot, commanded by one British policeman, Raymond Cafferata. Except for one Jew and Cafferata, all of the police constables were Arabs.[26]
The mob went from house to house, while the Arab police stood by, watching the slaughter. Some of them spurred on the rioters and even participated in the riots. The British police officer said in his testimony afterwards:

""On hearing screams in a room I went up a sort of tunnel passage and saw an Arab in the act of cutting off a child's head with a sword. He had already hit him and was having another cut, but on seeing me he tried to aim the stroke at me, but missed; he was practically on the muzzle of my rifle. I shot him low in the groin. Behind him was a Jewish woman smothered in blood with a man I recognized as an Arab police constable named Issa Sherif from Jaffa. He was standing over the woman with a dagger in his hand. He saw me and bolted into a room close by and tried to shut me out, shouting in Arabic, ""Your Honor, I am a policeman!"" I got into the room and shot him.""[27]
Believing they would be safer, many people had gathered in the home of one of the rabbis, Eliezer Dan Slonim Dwek. However, in that house alone, twenty-two men, women and children were slaughtered, including Eliezer Dan himself, his wife, Hannah, one of their children (aged 6) and Hannah’s parents. Hannah’s sister, aged fifteen, ""was pushed into a closet by Lezer Yanishker - one of the students in the Yeshivah. Yanishker, twenty-four years old, powerfully built, was known as the giant of the Yeshivah. He held the girl confined in the closet during the massacre. When she saw her parents killed - she was watching through a crack in the door of the closet - she would have screamed. Yanishker held her mouth, held it so tightly that her lips were swollen and distorted for weeks after. When the Arabs had done slaughtering they turned to plunder. They tried to open the unlocked door of the closet. Yanishker held its handle inside [with such strength] that they gave up trying to pry the door open. He saved his own and the girl's life thereby - much more than he could have done, despite his physical prowess, had he tried to face the armed killers.""[28]
In another house, the mob gouged out the eyes of Gershon Ben-Zion, the Hebron pharmacist, and stabbed him over and over again; then they cut off his wife's hands and killed her. They also tortured his
daughter, and then murdered her ""in a strange and cruel way."" American journalist Van Paassen was one of the first to arrive after the massacre and saw the results of the ""strange and cruel"" killings - when he arrived back in Jerusalem and heard the government and Arabs had published a refutation of the rumors that the dead Jews had been tortured and mutilated ""this made me rush back to [Hebron] accompanied by two medical men, Dr. Dantziger and Dr. Ticho. I intended to gather up the severed sexual organs and the cut-off women's breasts we had seen lying scattered over the floor and in the beds. But when we came to Hebron a telephone call from Jerusalem had ordered our access barred."" He also reported that the Arabs had draped blood-drenched female underwear around the pictures in the Slonim household.[29]
One survivor, Yosef Lazarovski, then only a young child, recounted: ""I remember a brownskinned Arab with a large mustache breaking through the door. He had a large knife and an axe that he swung through the doorjambs until he broke through. [He was] full of fury, screaming, ""Allah akbar!"" and ""Itbach al Yahud!"" [Slaughter the Jews!] I understood all this; my grandfather tried to hold my hand, then [he tried] to push me aside [and hide me], screaming, ""Shema Yisrael""…and then I remember another Arab… with an axe that he brought down on my grandfather’s neck…""
It wasn't till around midday on August 24 that British reinforcements arrived.[30] The survivors were eventually gathered at the police station, which itself came under attack; one small child was shot and killed while sheltering there. They were under siege for three days. On the evening of August 25 they dug 5 mass graves to bury their dead. The graves became known as Kever Achim (""Tomb of the Brothers""). At some point between 1948 and 1967, when Hebron was under Jordanian rule, Arabs dug up the graves and planted a vegetable garden on the site where the graves had been. After the Six Day War, the Israelis rebuilt the cemetery. 
In the aftermath, the surviving Jews were forced to leave their home city and resettled in Jerusalem. Some Jewish families tried to move back to Hebron, but were removed by the British authorities in 1936 at the start of the Arab revolt. In 1948, the War of Independence granted Israel statehood, but further cut the Jews off from Hebron, a city that was captured by King Abdullah's Arab Legion and ultimately annexed to Jordan.[31]

Arab assistance
A few Arabs did try to help the Jews. Out of a population of up to 60,000, nineteen Arabs risked their own lives to save several hundred Jews. Zmira Mani wrote about an Arab named Abu Id Zaitoun who brought his brother and son to rescue her and her family. The Arab family protected the Manis with their swords, then hid them in a cellar along with other Jews whom they had saved, eventually arranging for their escort to the police station at Beit Romano.[32][33] Rivka Slonim Burg was only eight years old when she hid behind Abu Shaker, an Arab neighbor who stood
in the doorway of her family’s home, protecting her and the rest of her immediate family from the mob: ""When he heard that something was happening in the city, he came and stood in the entrance to the house. Abu Shaker told the marauders that they would pass through the door to murder the Jews over his dead body. We heard what he said [to the mob] while he stood at the entrance. They [the Arab mob] wounded him, but they didn’t get into the house.""[34]
Bernzweig[35] records also:

""God, blessed be He, in His great mercy, sent us an Arab who lived in back of our house. He insisted that we come down from the doctor's apartment and enter his house through the back door. He took us to his cellar, a large room without windows to the outside. We all went in, while he, together with several Arab women, stood outside near the door. As we lay there on the floor, we heard the screams as Arabs were slaughtering Jews. It was unbearable. As for us, we felt that the danger was so great that we had no chance of coming out alive.
Five times the Arabs stormed our house with axes, and all in the while
those wild murderers kept screaming at the Arabs who were standing guard to hand over the Jews. They, in turn, shouted back that they had not hidden any Jews and knew nothing. They begged the attackers not to destroy their homes.

Suddenly, the door opened, and the police walked in. They had been told that we were hidden there. They insisted that we go along with them, and that they would take us to a safe place. We were afraid to go, because we thought they themselves might slaughter us. Eventually, they succeeded in convincing us that they had our welfare in mind. Since we couldn't walk there, they brought automobiles and took us, under police guard, to the police station, which was in a safe location.""
Arab deceit
Van Paassen describes one of the early but now universal acts of Arab deceit in which the Arab press published photographs of the wrecked Jewish theological seminary in Hebron, showing the bodies of the slain students lying in the foreground and capped with a heading saying that this was what the Jews had done to an Arab home.[36] 
In September 1929, the Secretaries of the Arab Executive distributed a paper throughout Palestine and the world
titled ""Scandals of Jewish Propaganda"", which stated that ""no mutilations"" and ""no atrocities in Hebron"" occurred. It also accused the Jews of publishing lies about the Arabs of Hebron to ""deceive public opinion, collect more money and reflect [negatively] on the dignity and honor of the Arabs.""[37]
Only five Arabs were brought to trial. An Englishman and an Arab served as the judges; a relative of the Grand Mufti acted as ""prosecutor"". Sheikh Talab Maraka, the leader of the mobs, was given a two-year sentence
of which he served one month. Three other Arabs were convicted and hung in Hebron. These Arabs are considered
national heroes by the Arab Palestinians, and during the first intifada, which commenced in 1987, Arabs throughout Judea and Samaria held a strike day in their memory.[38]

Hebron liberated
Toby Klein Greenwald recalled her first visit to Hebron: ""I arrived in Israel in July 1967, one month after the Six Day War. On my third day in the country, I went with several friends to the newly liberated Hebron and noticed something odd as we neared the city. There were white sheets or white pieces of clothing fluttering from every single rooftop. A soldier in the car with us explained that the sheets were ""symbols of surrender."" The Arabs of Hebron were sure that when a Jewish army returned, the soldiers would pay them back for what they had done during Tarpat (the Massacre of 1929). Hebron, explained the soldier, was liberated without a single shot being fired.""[39]

2010 Senate Candidates,https://www.conservapedia.com/2010_Senate_Candidates," In the 2010 Midterm Elections, the Republican Party gained 63 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and six seats in the U.S. Senate from the Democratic Party. Republicans also gained six governorships, including Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan.  Republicans gained 680 seats in state legislatures, the most in the modern era.[1]
Republicans gained the most House seats since the 1938 Midterm Elections, giving Republicans their biggest House majority, and Democrats their smallest minority, since 1946.  When blue dog Democrats are added to the Republicans on certain issues like gun control or marriage, the Republican majority is even greater than in 1946.
Democratic loses could be attributed to public rejection of the socialistic policies of the Obama administration. The public disapproved of President Obama's economic policies. In the days leading up to the election, a majority of voters supported repealing/replacing The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, sixty-five percent of voters said that the economic stimulus package either hurt the economy or did no good,[2] and fifty-four percent of those voting said they were dissatisfied with the performance of Barack Obama. Given the high level of Democratic success in the 2006 and 2008 elections, they were also put in the position of having to defend a large number of seats.
John Boehner (R-Ohio), become Speaker of the House in the 112th Congress, exchanging places with Nancy Pelosi (D-California). By tradition Pelosi would be expected to resign her leadership position after such a stunning repudiation by the electorate, but as a self-centered liberal she insisted on becoming the next Minority Leader.

2009 elections
In the Nov. 3, 2009, off-year elections, defeat was the fate of Democrats in New York City, New Jersey and Virginia. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent, spent his way to a third term in New York City while Republican Bob McDonnell won in a landslide for governor of Virginia; in New Jersey Republican Christopher Christie ousted the incumbent Democrat Jon Corzine despite his millions and Obama's campaigning.
Conservatives scored a major internal party victory in Oct. 2009 by forcing the Republican candidate Dede Scozzafava out of a House race in New York's 23rd district, for being too liberal. The Conservative Party candidate was defeated by the Democrat, however, opening up recriminations between GOP officials and conservatives on why the district was lost for the first time since 1992. Conservative activists zeroed in on the 2010 race for Florida's open Senate seat, in which the Republican party Senate campaign committee endorsed moderate Gov. Charlie Crist but the more conservative Marco Rubio mounted a successful challenge. ""If I were Charlie Crist in Florida, what's happening in New York 23 would make me extremely nervous,"" GOP strategist Todd Harris said. ""A lot of the establishment Republicans underestimated the grass-roots anger across the country about spending and the expansion of the federal government. The anger is boiling over now, but a lot of the seeds of discontent were planted over the last five to six years.""[3]

Ad campaigns
 Cartoonist Michael Ramirez of Investor's Business Daily captures the tone of the 2010 Midterm elections.
In late 2009 national money was being poured into nine districts, where Democrats who voted for their party's health care reform may be in trouble. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, representing business, has spent at least $1.6 million in November.  Liberals shoot back against the Chamber and 60 Plus Association with ads targeting 12 Democrats and one Republican who supported health reform. Three liberal groups, Americans United for Change and the labor unions AFSCME and SEIU are teaming up for $1.75 million worth of counter-messaging on broadcast and cable TV in the districts of Reps. Berry, Cao, Connolly, Donnelly, Ellsworth, Hill, Hodes, Michaud, Murphy, Perriello, Pomeroy, Snyder and Titus.
In mid-October the Democratic National Committee, echoing charges debunked[4] by the New York Times, insinuated that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce was using ""foreign money"" to fund ads criticizing Democrats. The president said in a Maryland stump speech, ""we learned that one of the largest groups paying for these ads regularly takes in money from foreign corporations. So groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence American elections, and they won't tell you where the money for their ads comes from…. This is a threat to our democracy."" 
The president himself has received $543,219 from Swiss banking giant UBS AG,[5] a foreign banking corporation which was later fined a record $780 million for its part in helping the rich evade U.S. income taxes.[6] Columnist Ruben Navarrette warned the pitfalls of playing the ""foreign card"" is



 “

 both offensive and dangerous. It exploits people's fears of the unknown and appeals to the prejudice that many of us feel toward those who are different. It also fuels ugly nativist instincts that -- once unleashed -- can do real damage....Democrats know this better than anyone ... The birther movement, which suggests that Obama was actually born in Kenya and thus not eligible to serve as a president, is all about playing the foreign card...[7]

 ”


Commentator Charles Krauthammer called the unfounded attacks on the Chamber of Commerce a baseless McCarthyite smear,[8] while columinst Jacob Sullum wrote,



 “

 Obama's attempt to discredit his opponents by linking them to sinister outsiders reminds us that neither major party has a monopoly on xenophobia. To some extent, crying ""foreigner"" reflects the president's desperation in the face of the Democrats' looming midterm losses.[9]

 ”


Pre-election Forecasts
In recent years, as the chart shows, the incumbent party loses an average of 16 House seats.  The GOP needed 39 seats to win back the House.  
Democrats had to defend about 60 marginal House seats in 2010, as opposed to about 40 for Republicans. At high risk were 27 Democratic seats and just 13 Republican seats that may see a party switch.
Election forecasters in September 2009 were revising their predictions downward for the Democrats, as Obama's popularity continues to plunge. From April to August, Obama lost 10 points across the board—suffering losses in every group except blacks, who remain loyal to him.[10] The popularity of Congress remains low. Starting in January 2010 the number of Americans who identify themselves as Democrats was at a seven-year low.[11] The Republican party, however, suffers from a lack of leaders and its own poor reputation in voter esteem.
""No question, August proved cathartic for voters and chaotic for congressional Democrats. But way before the town hall meetings during recess, there were ample signs for Democrats to fear for their careers in 2010,"" concluded Cook Political Report House analyst David Wasserman, who predicts the Democrats will lose 20 seats in the House, but retain control.[12]  Wasserman concludes that a major shift has been underway among ""angry white seniors"" (over age 60), who strongly dislike the Obama health care proposals because they fear they will lose benefits they now have. 
Analyst Stuart Rothenberg reported that, ""Growing public concern about spending, taxes and the size of government has started to shift the national landscape away from the Democrats to a more neutral position, and quite possibly toward the GOP.""[13] Furthermore, an advantage for Republicans was that 48 House Democrats, 8 more than the size of their majority, come from districts that voted for both George W. Bush and John McCain.[14]
Columnist Rich Galen observed,



 “

 He railroaded his signature legislation - Obamacare - through the Congress costing his party 60+ seats in the 2010 mid-term election and guaranteeing GOP control of the House for the foreseeable future. Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi will go down in history as enablers of the sacrifice of Obama's Congressional allies on the alter of his enormous ego.[15]

Senate
Texas Senator John Cornyn, the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, quietly put Senate Republicans in a position to benefit as the national political environment went negative toward Democrats, and was successful in narrowing the Democratic majority. Without losing any of their seats, the Republican Party defeated two incumbents, Blanche Lincoln (D-Arkansas) and Russ Feingold (D-Wisconsin), and won four Democratic-held open seats: Illinois, Indiana, North Dakota, and Pennsylvania. Additionally, Republican Scott Brown was elected to replace the late Senator Ted Kennedy (D-Massachusetts) in a January special election.  

Republican Gains
Arkansas
Moderate Democrat Blanche Lincoln was defeated by 21 percentage points after Republicans made her one of their top targets in 2010. In the 2008 Presidential Election, Arkansas was one of the few states where John McCain exceeded George W. Bush’s margin, despite the national trend favoring Democrats. Generally, she voted the party line with President Obama, which angered her conservative constituents, but also voted against the Employee Free Choice Act (card check) and opposed to the public option in health care, which angered liberals. She began airing TV ads in March touting her independence from President Obama and national Democrats. Lincoln defeated Lieutenant Governor Bill Halter in a close runoff for the Democratic nomination.
Third district Congressman John Boozman easily won the Republican nomination, defeating State Senator Gilbert Baker and former State Senator Jim Holt. Boozman comfortably led thoughout the entire campaign.

Indiana
Two-term Democrat Evan Bayh dropped out of his reelection in February after polls showed he may be vulnerable after his vote for the economic stimulus package and government-run health care. Former Republican U.S. Senator Dan Coats, who predeced Bayh after retiring in 1998, announced his candidacy for his old Senate seat. Former six-term Congressman John Hostettler, State Senator Marlin Stutzman and businessman Don Bates Jr. were defeated for the Republican nomination. Conservative Congressman Mike Pence considered running, but instead chose to seek reelection in the House.
8th district Congressman Brad Ellsworth was the Democratic nominee. Dan Coats defeated Ellsworth by a 55%-40% margin. Ellsworth supported President Obama’s health care plan in a state where opposition to the legislation is higher than it was nationally.[16]

Illinois
Democratic Senator Roland Burris had been plagued by controversies. Burris was appointed to replace Barack Obama by Governor Rod Blagojevich, who had been arrested on a variety of federal corruption charges (including for trying to ""sell"" Obama's Senate seat). Burris was then accused of committing perjury after he admitted to not testifying truthfully at a committee investigating Governor Blagojevich. Burris announced he would not seek a full term in 2010.
Moderate-GOP Congressman Mark Kirk, representing a Democratic-leaning district that covers suburban Chicago, easily won the Republican nomination, while Illinois State Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias defeated Chicago Inspector General David Hoffman in a close primary. Both candidates faced negative media publicity, Giannoulias for the collapse of his family bank, and Kirk for exaggerating his military record. In the general election, Kirk defeated Giannoulias by a 48%-46% margin.

Massachusetts
Republican State Senator Scott Brown pulled a major upset when he defeated Attorney General Martha Coakley by a 52%-47% margin.
Liberal icon Ted Kennedy, the third longest-serving Senator in U.S. history, died in August 2009, marking the end of an era. During the 2004 Presidential Election the Democratic super-majority in the state legislator blocked the right of Republican Governor Mitt Romney to appoint an interim senator had John Kerry been elected President. After changing the law to allow Governor Deval Patrick, a Democrat, the right to appoint a temporary replacement for Kennedy, he choose former Democratic National Committee chairman Paul Kirk. He did not seek a full term of his own, and a special election was held on January 19, 2010. 
State Attorney General Martha Coakley won the Democratic primary, defeating businessman Alan Khazei, Representative Mike Capuano, and Boston Celtics co-owner Stephen Pagliuca. Charismatic State Senator Scott Brown was the Republican nominee.[17]

 a last minute appeal
It was a safe Democratic seat until January, when Democrats reeled in shock as Coakley lost her 30-point lead and trailed by 5-10 points in the closing hours. Coakley was an ineffective machine-style insider candidate who was unable to reach independents. Brown's main theme was that he would be the 41st senator and would block the Obama health care plan—which Massachusetts did not need, he explained, because it had its own plan in operation. Coakley responded by attacking bankers and bringing in big guns like Bill Clinton, John Kerry and Barack Obama. They appealed to regular Democrats and alienated the equally numerous independents, who preferred Brown by more than 2-1. 
The defeat for Coakley, coming on the heels of the Democrats' loss of Virginia and New Jersey in Nov. 2009, was a major blow to the liberal caused and reinvigorated the Republican party nationally.

North Dakota
Byron Dorgan, a three-term Democrat Senator from North Dakota, announced he would not seek reelection. Dorgan's announcement represented an opportunity for Republicans, after popular Governor John Hoeven announced his candidacy.[18] Hoeven defeated State Senator Tracy Potter by a 76%-22% margin, carrying every county.

Pennsylvania
After polls showed him losing the Republican primary by as much as 20 points, Arlen Specter simply changed party affiliation to Democrat. Despite full support by President Obama and virtually every elected Democrat in Pennsylvania as well as nearly every major newspaper, Specter went on to lose the Democratic nomination to 7th-district Congressman Joe Sestak in the primary, and faced former 15th district Congressman and Club for Growth President Pat Toomey, known for his economic conservatism. In the general election, Toomey defeated Sestak by a 51%-49% margin.

Wisconsin
Three-term incumbent Russ Feingold had positioned himself for a comfortable reelection after former governor and Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson announced he would not run. However, Tea Party activist and Oshkosh businessman Ron Johnson defeated Feingold by a 52%-47% margin.

Democratic Holds
California
Although California is a solidly Democratic state, conservatives originally saw outspoken liberal Senator Barbara Boxer as vulnerable. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was term-limited in 2010, announced he would not run. Former Hewlett-Packard Company President Carly Fiorina defeated former U.S. Rep. Tom Campbell and Assemblyman Chuck DeVore in the Republican primary. Boxer defeated Fiorina by ten percentage points.

Colorado
Appointed Democratic Senator Michael Bennet was narrowly reelected. Former Speaker of the Colorado House of Representatives Andrew Romanoff was defeated in his bid to challenge Bennet for the Democratic nomination, while Weld County District Attorney Ken Buck defeated former Lieutenant Governor Jane Norton in the Republican primary. 

Connecticut
30-year Senate veteran Chris Dodd announced he would not seek a sixth term. Dodd's approval ratings plummeted after his failed presidential campaign in 2008, his controversial mortgage deal from Countrywide, and revelations about the $165 million bonuses for AIG executives that he attached in an amendment to the economic stimulus package, despite receiving federal bailout money. Popular state Attorney General Richard Blumenthal won the Democratic nomination, increasing the Democrats' chances of holding the seat. However, his poll numbers dropped after a New York Times report revealed that he exaggerated his military record.
Republicans nominated World Wrestling Entertainment CEO Linda McMahon, defeating former Congressman Rob Simmons and libertarian-leaning economist Peter Schiff, a stock broker and adviser to Ron Paul’s 2008 presidential campaign. Blumenthal won the general election by a 55%-43% margin.

Delaware
Joe Biden was simultaneously elected to a seventh term in the Senate and Vice President at the same time. Democratic Governor Ruth Ann Minner appointed a ""caretaker"" Senator, Ted Kaufman. Michael Castle, a moderate Republican who also served as Governor and Lieutenant Governor, was heavily favored to win the Republican nomination. However, Tea Party backed insurgent Christine O’Donnell ousted Castle in the primary, improving New Castle County Executive Chris Coons chances in holding the seat for Democrats. The Republican Party had a mixed reaction to O’Donnell's victory. She had caused controversy regarding her views on creationism and Christian values. Coons defeated O’Donnell by a 57%-40% margin.

Hawaii
Democrat Daniel Inouye easily won reelection against Republican Representative Campbell Cavasso.

Maryland
Entrenched incumbent Barbara Mikulski easily won reelection, defeating physician and Queen Anne's County Commissioner Eric Wargotz.

Nevada
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid faced a competitive reelection in 2010. The ""Cook Political Report"" in September 2009 rateed the contest as ""Toss Up."" His status weakened in summer 2009, as discontent with President Obama and the Democrats' health plan mounted, and as the Recession of 2008 continues to batter Las Vegas and the entire Nevada economy, with no relief in sight from the stimulus bill Reid pushed through the Senate. Reid's inability to improve his standing in the polls, coupled with the deteriorating political environment for Democrats nationally, were clear indications that his political problems are deep and will be difficult (though not impossible) to fix, says Cook. 
After receiving the endorsement of the Tea Party Express and Club for Growth, former Assemblywoman Sharron Angle defeated former State Senator Sue Lowden and businessman Danny Tarkanian in the Republican primary. Reid defeated Angle by a 50%-45% margin.

New York
Senior Senator Charles Schumer was considered the safest incumbent of 2010 and won his reelection by a 66%-33% margin against Republican Jay Townsend.

New York-Special Election
Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand was appointed by Governor David Patterson to replace Hillary Clinton after much confusion on his part. Patterson mishandled the proposed appointment of Caroline Kennedy, gaining ridicule for both of them.  Gillibrand's moderate views alienated the left wing of the Democratic Party. Former Tennessee Congressman Harold Ford, Jr. has announced he will not seek a primary challenge to Gillibrand.
Nine-term Congressman Peter King has declined to run. Republicans are tried but failed to recruit former Governor George Pataki, who ran ahead in the polls with Gillibrand. Real estate billionaire Mort Zuckerman, despite having a record of supporting liberal causes, was mentioned as a possible Republican or Independent candidate to avoid a primary, however announced that he would not run. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani declined to seek the Senate seat.[19] Instead, Republicans nominated former Congressman Joseph DioGuardi, whom Gillibrand defeated by a 62%-36% margin.

Oregon
Democratic Senator Ron Wyden defeated his Republican challenger, Lewis & Clark College law professor Jim Huffman by a 57%-39% margin. 

Vermont
Patrick Leahy, the third most senior U.S. Senator, was reelected by a 64%-40% margin against Republican Len Britton.

Washington
Polls show that Senator Patty Murray, once considered well positioned for reelection, would face a competitive race against Washington's former state Senator, Dino Rossi. In November, Murray defeated Rossi by a 52%-48% margin.

West Virginia
Popular Democratic Governor Joe Manchin was elected to replace the late Exalted Cyclops Senator Robert Byrd. Businessman and 2006 nominee John Raese made the race surprisingly close by tying Manchin to the Obama administration.

Republican Holds
Alabama
Senior Senator Richard Shelby, who was originally elected as a conservative Democrat but changed party affiliation to Republican after the 1994 Republican Revolution, was handedly reelected, as he was in 1992, 1998, and 2004. 

Alaska 
Lisa Murkowski won a term for the U.S. Senate in her own right in 2004 by a close 48%-45% margin, however, in 2010 she lost the Primary Election against Joe Miller, a Conservative candidate and Tea Party favorite. Democrats nominated Sitka, Alaska Mayor Scott McAdams. Murkowski pursued her campaign as a write-in candidate, and was reelected with a 39% plurality, while Miller received 35% and McAdams 23%. She has the distinction of being the first person elected to the Senate via write-in since Strom Thurmond in 1954. 

Arizona
Senior Senator John McCain, the Republicans presidential nominee in 2008, caught a break when Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano was appointed Secretary of Homeland Security. However, former Congressman J. D. Hayworth challenged McCain in a primary, but was defeated by a 56%-32% margin. McCain went on to defeat Tucson City Councilor Rodney Glassman by a 59%-35% margin. 

Florida
Republican Governor Charlie Crist, who once enjoyed high approval ratings, appointed George LeMieux upon the resignation of Senator Mel Martinez. LeMieux held the seat temporarily for Governor Crist who decided to run for the Senate. He was the establishment pick for the Republican nomination, but was challenged by conservative Florida House Speaker and Tea Party backed candidate Marco Rubio, who led by 32 points according to Public Policy Polling.[20] Crist announced he would drop out of the Republican primary and run as an Independent. 
Crist alienated conservatives when he campaigned with President Obama in support for the $787 billion economic stimulus package, which was entirely opposed by the Florida Republican federal delegation. Democrats nominated 17th district Congressman Kendrick Meek, who defeated billionaire businessman Jeff Greene. Rubio was elected with a 49% plurality, defeating Crist who received 30% and Meek who received 20%. 

Georgia
First-term Senator Johnny Isakson's had solid standing for his reelection. His most formidable Democratic opponent, state Attorney General Thurbert Baker, instead sought a campaign for Governor. Isakson defeated Labor Commissioner Mike Thurmond by a 58%-39% margin.

Idaho
Mike Crapo's conservative voting record goes along with the Republican stronghold of Idaho. In 2004, he faced no Democratic challenger and won reelection with over 99% of the vote. Crapo's seat was one of the safest in the 2010 election cycle, and he won reelection by a 71%-25% margin.

Iowa
30-year incumbent Charles Grassley is one of the most distinguished and influential Republican Senators in Washington (he serves as ranking member of the Finance Committee). He was reelected by a 65%-33% margin against former U.S. Attorney Roxanne Conlin, carrying all but one county.

Kansas
Incumbent Republican Sam Brownback honored his campaign pledge to serve only two terms. 1st district Congressman Jerry Moran defeated 4th district Congressman Todd Tiahrt for the Republican nomination by a 50%-45% margin, while Democrats nominated Lisa Johnston, an administrator at Baker University. Moran defeated Johnston by a 70%-26% margin. 

Kentucky
Republicans had a victory when unpopular incumbent Senator Jim Bunning announced he would not seek a third term. Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson sought the Republican nomination, however was defeated by Tea Party activist Rand Paul, an eye surgeon who is the son of Texas Congressman Ron Paul. Paul received the endorsment of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin.[21] On the Democratic side, Lieutenant Governor Daniel Mongiardo (who lost to Bunning in 2004) was defeated by Attorney General Jack Conway. Paul campaigned on a reducation in taxion and spending, and won the support of conservatives and libertarians alike. Paul defeated Conway by a 56%-44% margin.

Louisiana
Louisiana, a conservative state, was not effected by the national trend for Democrats in 2006 and 2008. Republican Bobby Jindal was elected Governor by a landslide in 2007, in 2008 John McCain received a larger margin of victory in the state than George W. Bush in 2004, while the GOP gained two House seats from the Democrats. Yet first-term Republican David Vitter was considered to be vulnerable for his reelection after he confessed in 2007 to seeing an escort service, which has tainted his career. Third-district Congressman Charlie Melancon won the Democratic nomination. Vitter defeated Melancon by a 57%-38% margin.

Missouri
Incumbent Republican Senator Kit Bond announced he will not seek fifth term. Former House Majority Whip Roy Blunt announced his candidacy. Blunt benefited from strong fundraising numbers and President Obama's dismal approval ratings in Missouri. Secretary of State Robin Carnahan won the Democratic nomination. BLunt defeated Carnahan by a 54%-41% margin.

New Hampshire
Senior Republican Senator Judd Gregg, after withdrawing from a position in the Obama administration, announced he will not seek a fourth term. 2nd district Congressman Paul Hodes won the Democratic nomination, while Republicans nominated former New Hampshire Attorney General Kelly Ayotte. Ayotte defeated Hodes by a 60%-37% margin.

North Carolina
First-term Republican Richard Burr was considered vulnerable after Barack Obama won North Carolina's 15 electoral votes by a narrow margin, and Democrat Kay Hagan defeated Republican Senator Elizabeth Dole. It is also worth noting that no Senator has held this seat for more than one term since 1974. Secretary of State Elaine Marshall defeated former State Senator Cal Cunningham and Attorney Ken Lewis in the Democratic primary. Burr was reelected by a 55%-43% margin.

Ohio
Moderate Republican George Voinovich announced he would not seek a third term. Lieutenant Governor Lee Fisher won the Democratic nomination over Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner with 55% of the vote, a much closer margin than polls had shown.[22] Fisher received the endorsement of Democratic Governor Ted Strickland. Meanwhile, Republicans rallied behind Rob Portman, former Congressman and Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Although polls originally showed a tight race, Portman defeated Fisher by a 57%-39% margin.

Oklahoma
Tom Coburn was elected to a second term by a 71%-26% margin against Democrat Jim Rogers.

South Carolina
First-term Republican Jim DeMint, whose reputation as an outspoken conservative, has not hurt him in the Republican stronghold of South Carolina. Democrats nominated an unconventional candidate, Alvin Greene, an unemployed Army veteran who was indicted on criminal charges for showing pornographic pictures to a teenage college student.[23] DeMint defeated Greene by a 61%-28% margin.  

South Dakota
In 2004, John Thune defeated Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, and his victory quickly made him a rising star in the Republican Party. Thune ran unopposed in his reelection.[24]

Utah 
Three-term Senator Robert Bennett represents a state that John McCain won by over thirty-percentage points and was expected to win reelection by a comfortable margin. However, he was defeated in the Republican caucus to Mike Lee and Tim Bridgewater after his vote for TARP. Bennett ruled out a write-in campaign, and Lee went on to win the Republican primary and general election.

Governors
In the 2010 gubernatorial elections, the Democratic Party won five governorships held by retiring Republicans: California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Minnesota, and Vermont. The Republican Party won nine governorships from retiring Democrats: Kansas, Oklahoma, Maine, Michigan, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Wisconsin, Wyoming, and defeated two incumbents, Chet Culver of Iowa and Ted Strickland of Ohio. An Independent was elected Governor of Rhode Island to replace a retiring Republican, and a Republican was elected Governor of Florida to replace an Independent. Thus, Republicans had a net gain of six governorships, and the majority of Governors in the United States flipped from Democrat to Republican. Republicans also won the governorships of New Jersey and Virginia from the Democrats in the 2009 elections.

Democratic Gains
California
Incumbent Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger was prohibited from seeking reelection because of term-limits. Schwarzenegger was elected in 2003 after a recall of Governor Gray Davis and reelected in a landslide in 2006. However, Schwarzenegger's popularity, along with the Democratic assembly, fell because of the California budget crisis. State Attorney General and former Governor Jerry Brown won the Democratic nomination. On the Republican side, former Ebay CEO Meg Whitman defeated State Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner.
San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom was seeking the Democratic nomination, however dropped out in October 2009 after lackluster poll numbers and meager fund-raising receipts.[25] In the general election, Brown defeated Whitman by a 53%-42% margin.

Connecticut
M. Jodi Rell, despite being a Republican Governor from a blue state, was reelected with 63% of the vote in 2006 and had high approval ratings throughout her tenure as governor. However, she announced she would not run for another term.[26] Lieutenant Governor Michael Fedele announced his candidacy, but was defeated for the Republican nomination by former U.S. Ambassador Tom Foley. Democrats chose Stamford Mayor Dan Malloy over former U.S. Senate candidate Ned Lamont. After a recount, Malloy was confirmed to have won the governorship by a 50%-49% margin.

Hawaii 
Republican Governor Linda Lingle was term-limited. James Aiona, who served as the state's Lieutenant Governor eight years, ran to become her successor, but was defeated by 10-term Congressman Neil Abercrombie by a 58%-41% margin.

Minnesota
Two-term Governor Tim Pawlenty announced he would not seek another term, and became a potential 2012 GOP presidential candidate. Republican State Representative Tom Emmer and former Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Dayton won their parties nominations, respectively. After a recount, Dayton was confirmed to have won by a 0.5% margin.  

Vermont
Although a solidly Democratic state (Barack Obama won it with over 67% of the vote) Republican Jim Douglas was elected governor in 2002 and reelected in 2004, 2006, and 2008. Douglas announced he would not run for another term, and Republicans nominated Lieutenant Governor Brian Dubie. Democratic State Senator Peter Shumlin defeated Dubie by a 50%-48% margin in the general election.

Independent Gains
Rhode Island
Although Democrats have dominated Rhode Island politics, they have voted Republican for 7 of the last 10 gubernatorial elections. As Rhode Island was hit hard by the national recession, Republican Governor Donald Carcieri suffered in the polls, and was barred from seeking a third term because of term-limits. Lincoln Chafee, former Senator who was known as the most liberal Republican in Congress, was elected Governor as an Independent, defeating Republican John Robitaille and Democrat Frank Caprio. After President Obama refused to endorse Caprio, he caused controversy by telling Obama to take his endorsement and ""shove it."" [27]

Republican Gains
Florida
Republican turned Independent Governor Charlie Crist announced he would not seek a second term and instead run for the United States Senate, resulting in an open race. State Attorney General Bill McCollum was heavily favored to win the Republican nomination, but was defeated by Rick Scott, a millionaire health care executive and activist against federal health care legislation. Democrats nominated Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink, who led Scott in most of the polls following the primary. Scott's campaign emphasized conservative policies such as expanding school choice, abolishing the corporate income tax, and firing state employees.[28] He won the general election by a narrow 49%-48% margin. 

Iowa
Chet Culver, who was elected governor in 2006 riding on a Democratic wave, was defeated in a competitive reelection. Culver governed as a progressive in a swing state, increasing the minimum wage and raising the cigarette tax. His job approval ratings fell as the economy continued to falter. Former Governor Terry Branstad defeated Culver by a 53%-43% margin.

Kansas
Kathleen Sebelius, a Democratic Governor from the Republican-stronghold of Kansas, stepped down after being nominated to serve as Secretary of Health and Human Services in the Obama administration. Lieutenant Governor Mark Parkinson, a former Republican, took her place, and announced he would not seek a full term. Senator Sam Brownback was the Republican nominee, and defeated Democratic state Senator Tom Holland by a 63%-32% margin.

Maine
Democrat Governor John Baldacci was term-limited by state law, and Republicans saw it as an opportunity to gain the governorship. Republicans nominated Waterville, Maine Mayor Paul LePage, who defeated Independent candidate Eliot Cutler and Democratic state Senate President Libby Mitchell with a 38% plurarly. 

Michigan
Democratic Governor Jennifer Granholm suffered in her job approval ratings as the Michigan economy, heavily dependent of the auto industry, continued to falter throughout the 2000s. She was legally barred from seeking a third-term under state law. The Republican nominee, former President and COO of Gateway, Inc. Rick Snyder, easily defeated Democrat Lansing Mayor Virgil Bernero by a 58%-40% margin in the general election.

New Mexico
Democratic Governor Bill Richardson was nominated by President Obama to serve as Secretary of Commerce, however was forced to resign after it was exposed that his administration had a ""pay-to-play"" deal with a defense contractor. Richardson denied any wrongdoing. Although he was popular for most of his tenure, and handedly reelected in 2006, his approval ratings fell to 28% as the economy declined.[29] As he was term-limited in 2010, Lieutenant Governor Diane Denish won the Democratic Party nomination. The Republican nomination went to District Attorney Susana Martinez, and narrowly led in the polls throughout the campaign. She defeated Denish by a 54%-46% margin, becoming the first Hispanic woman elected governor in the United States. 

Ohio
Incumbent Democrat Ted Strickland faced sagging approval ratings and tough reelection prospects as Ohio lost jobs and population during his governorship. His Republican opponent, John Kasich – a former Congressman and Chairman of the House Budget Committee in the 1990s – campaigned on phasing out the state income tax, leasing the state's toll roads, cutting 15-20 percent of the state's higher education funds, and relaxing sentences on nonviolent offenders to cut down prison costs.[30] He defeated Strickland by a 49%-47% margin.

Oklahoma
Democratic Governor Brad Henry could not run for reelection because of term limits. Republicans nominated U.S. Representative Marry Fallin, who defeated Lieutenant Governor Jari Askins, becoming the first woman elected governor of Oklahoma.

Pennsylvania
Democratic Governor Ed Rendell was term limited in 2010. Democrats nominated Allegheny County Chief Executive Dan Onorato. Republicans nominated Attorney General Tom Corbett. 6th district Congressman Jim Gerlach was a Republican candidate, however dropped out in January and sought reelection instead. In the general election Corbett defeated Onorato by a 55%-45% margin.

Tennessee
Democratic Governor Phil Bredesen was term limited and unable to seek reelection. Tennessee, a conservative-leaning state, elected Knoxville Republican mayor Bill Haslam over Democrat Mike McWherter.

Democratic Holds
Arkansas
Centrist Democrat Mike Beebe enjoyed high approval ratings throughout his tenure as Governor. He was reelected by a 65%-34% margin against former Republican State Senate Jim Keet, despite Republicans making strong inroads in the traditionally Democratic supporting Arkansas during the 2010 election.

Colorado 
Despite Democratic success in Colorado during the 2006 and 2008 elections, incumbent Governor Bill Ritter announced his retirement after the prospects of a difficult reelection. His policies of higher taxes and unionization of state employees earned him criticism from the business community, and his approval ratings fell to 45%.[31] Former Congressman Scott McInnis was favored to win the Republican nomination, however fell in the polls after a controversy regarding plagiarizing an article, and was defeated by businessman and political newcomer Dan Maes, who also received criticism for misrepresenting his law enforcement background in the 1980s. Meanwhile, former Congressman Tom Tancredo entered the race in the American Constitution Party, and surged towards the end of the campaign. The turmoil made is easier for Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper to hold the Governors office for the Democrats, and was elected 50% of the vote, to Tancredo's 37% and Maes 11%.

Illinois
Democratic Governor Pat Quinn was installed as governor after the impeachment of Rod Blagojevich, and announced he would seek a full term. Quinn narrowly won the Democratic nomination against State Comptroller Dan Hynes. State Senator Bill Brady won the Republican nomination, defeating State Senator Kirk Dillard, and former State GOP chair Andrew McKenna. In the general election, Quinn pulled somewhat of an upset, winning reelection by a 47%-46% margin.  

Maryland
Democrat Martin O'Malley will likely run for a second term in 2010. O'Malley's approval ratings fell to 33% after a series of tax increases. The race was expected to be competitive with former Governor Robert Ehrlich seeking a rematch, however O'Malley was reelected by 14 percentage points.    

Massachusetts
Deval Patrick, although a Democratic Governor from a blue state, faced a difficult reelection after a disappointing performance as governor. The Republican nominee was health care executive Charlie Baker. Patrick was reelected with a 48% plurality, with Baker receiving 42% and Independent Paul Loscocco 8%.

New York
After Democratic Governor Eliot Spitzer resigned in disgrace when it was revealed that he was involved in a prostitution ring, Lieutenant Governor David Paterson took office. Governor Paterson's approval ratings plummeted to 21% [32] after his handling of the state budget crisis, his mismanagement of filling in the appointment of Hillary Clinton's vacant Senate seat, and a proposed number of tax increases. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani declined to seek the governorship and endorsed former Congressman Rick Lazio. 
President Barack Obama in Sept. 2009 contacted Paterson, asking him not to seek reelection in 2010 in that he cannot recover from his dismal political standing. Democrats nominated a stronger candidate, State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo. Republicans nominated Tea Party favorite and real estate developer Carl Paladino. Polls originally showed a tightening race, however a series of missteps resulted in Cuomo being handedly elected with over 60-percent of the vote.  

Oregon
Incumbent Governor Ted Kulongoski could not seek a third term. Democrats nominated John Kitzhaber, who served as governor from 1995 until 2003. He defeated former NBA player Chris Dudley in the general election by a 49%-48% margin.

Republican Holds
Alabama
Republican Governor Bob Riley is term-limited after two terms, and both parties faced a competitive primary. State Agriculture Commissioner Ron Sparks trounced 7th district Congressman Artur Davis for the Democratic nomination, while State Representative and physician Robert Bentley defeated former State Senator Bradley Byrne in the Republican runoff. Bentley led in the polls by twenty points throughout the campaign, and was elected by a 58%-42% margin. Republicans have won 6 out of the last 7 gubernatorial elections in Alabama, and John McCain won its 9 electoral votes by 60-percentage points.

Alaska
Sarah Palin, one-term Governor and former Vice-Presidential nominee, resigned on July 3, 2009 and Lieutenant Governor Sean Parnell inherited the governorship. Although Democrats nominated a formidable challenger, former State House Minority Leader Ethan Berkowitz, Parnell was elected to a full term by a 59%-38% margin.  

Arizona 
After Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano was nominated by President Obama to serve as Secretary of Homeland Security, Arizona Secretary of State Janice K. Brewer, a Republican, succeeded her. She announced that she would seek a full term.[33] In the beginning of 2010, Brewer was considered to be one of the most vulnerable Republican Governors up for reelection. However, her popularity rose after signing a controversial illegal immigration law, and was reelected against state Attorney General Terry Goddard by a 55%-42% margin.

Georgia
In 2002, Sonny Perdue became the first Republican elected Governor of Georgia since reconstruction, and was reelected in 2006. However, he was term-limited in 2010. With an open race, former Governor Roy Barnes handedly defeated Attorney General Thurbert Baker in the Democratic primary, while Republicans narrowly nominated Congressman Nathan Deal over Secretary of State Karen Handel. Deal defeated Barnes by a 53%-43% margin+.

Guam
Guam Governor Felix P. Camacho, a Republican, was term limited in 2010. The Governors office stayed in Republican hands with the election of State Senator Eddie Calvo. 

Idaho
Butch Otter, governor of one of the most conservative states in the nation, was reelected by a 59%-33% margin.

Nebraska
Republican Governor Dave Heineman, who was easily reelected with 73% of the vote in 2006, was easily won another term with 74% of the vote.

Nevada
Republican Governor Jim Gibbons was defeated in the primary by former State Attorney General Brian Sandovalby. Gibbons was vulnerable for his reelection after a series of scandals in his administration, a messy divorce and lawsuit, his failure to examine the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste site, and his handling of the budget, brought his approval ratings down. Clark County Commissioner Rory Reid — son of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid - won the Democratic nomination. In the general election, Sandovalby defeated Reid by a 53%-42% margin.   

South Carolina
Republican Governor Mark Sanford's possible presidential ambitions for 2012 ended after it was exposed he was having an extramarital affair with a woman from Argentine. Sanford would not resign, however was barred from seeking a third term because of term limits. Both parties prepared for an open race. State Representative Nikki Haley defeated Congressman Gresham Barrett in the Republican primary. State Senator Vincent Sheheen won the Democratic nomination. Haley defeated Sheheen bu a 51%-47% margin, becoming the first woman elected Governor of South Carolina, and the second Indian-American elected Governor, next to Bobby Jindal of Louisiana. 

South Dakota
Two-term Republican Governor Mike Rounds could not run for a third-term because of term limits. Republicans nominated Lieutenant Governor Dennis Daugaard and Democrats nominated state Senate Minority Leader Scott Heidepriem. Daugaard defeated Heidepriem by a 62%-38% margin. 

Texas 
Former Lieutenant Governor under George W. Bush and now Governor, Rick Perry was elected for an unprecedented third consecutive term. Perry alienated some citizens with his support of the Trans-Texas Corridor and social conservatives with an executive order mandating vaccine for school girls. Still, he defeated Senior Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison for the Republican nomination, after attacking her as a Washington insider and big spender. The Democratic nominee was former Houston Mayor Bill White.  

Utah
Lieutenant Governor Gary Herbert, Republican, inherited the governorship after Governor Jon Huntsman, Jr. resigned to serve as U.S Ambassador to China. In a state that has not elected a Democrat Governor since 1980, Herbert was elected to a full term.

It is canonical in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and Eritrean Orthodox Church. Enoch was read by many early Christians, and Jude quotes the book in Jude 1:14-15 
""And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these men, saying, Behold, YHWH cometh with ten thousands of his saints, To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him."" (1 Enoch 1:9)
Major Events from the Book of Enoch are also quoted in Genesis 6:1-4
""Now it came about, when men began to multiply on the face of the land, and daughters were born to them, that the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful and they took wives for themselves, whomever they chose. Then YHWH said, ""My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, because he also is flesh nevertheless his days shall be one hundred and twenty years.""

19th Amendment,https://www.conservapedia.com/19th_Amendment,"

 “

 The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.
Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.


 ”



This amendment was ratified in 1920, as advocates (""suffragettes"") cited women's support of World War I to persuade President Woodrow Wilson to change his position from opposing this amendment to supporting it.  Women could already vote in many areas of the country, but this amendment guaranteed the right, in violation of the principle of states' rights and in support of individual civil rights, a phenomenon further seen in civil rights legislation after the civil rights movement.
Opposition to this amendment, especially in the South, was very strong. Long after the Civil War, many southerners believed feminism had emerged as an offshoot of abolitionism. They also strongly believed that the suffragists challenged a precept deeply rooted in religion, law, and custom: the belief that women should be subordinate to men.[1]

2010 Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion,https://www.conservapedia.com/2010_Deepwater_Horizon_drilling_rig_explosion," President Obama directed the United States Coast Guard to dump toxic disperants into the Gulf of Mexico despite known health hazards to humans and wildlife. [3]The Gulf of Mexico oil spill began on 20 April 2010 when the Deepwater Horizon offshore oil drilling rig operated by BP (known as British Petroleum until 2000) exploded and sank.[1] Oil began leaking at a rate eventually estimated at 2.5 million gallons per day, resulting in massive environmental degradation.[2] The federal government reported that 206 million gallons of crude oil leaked before the spill was stopped on July 15.[3] The blowout killed eleven workers. Despite the known toxicity of the dispersant Corexit, the Obama administration dumped millions of gallons of the hazardous chemical into the Gulf of Mexico with C-130 aircraft provided by the U.S. Coast Guard[4] and the Air Force.[5]
On 31 March 2010 President Obama announced a plan for exploitation of offshore oil reserves during a speech at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington, D.C.[6] The President's actions have been labeled, ""a decision to endanger our coastal ecosystems with the risk of catastrophic oil spills.""[7] Defending the decision, the President remarked,



 “

 oil rigs today generally don’t cause spills. They are technologically very advanced.""[8][9]

 ”


Since taking office the Obama administration approved 346 oil drilling plans without securing permits required by law from the federal agency that assesses environmental impacts.[10] President Barack Obama has been widely criticized for an unprepared and bungled response, most notably from former supporters.

As of 15 July  2010 BP announced that the gushing well had been successfully capped. As of 4 August the government reported that only 26% of the originally leaked oil could be located in the Gulf.[11]

The Obama plan
 Map of expanded areas of offshore oil drilling authorized by President Obama on 31 March 2010.[12]Source: United States Department of Interior.
Obama called for expanded development and production throughout the Gulf of Mexico. The Department of Interior's Minerals Management Service (MMS) estimates that the Gulf of Mexico contains 36-41.5 billion barrels of  oil and 161-207 trillion cubic feet of natural gas resources. According a DOI press release, Obama's plan would ""expand oil and gas development and exploration"" while ""protecting fisheries, tourism, and places off U.S. coasts that are not appropriate for development.""[13]
The Associated Press has reported on the role ex-government regulators play in lobbying and influence; the chief of staff of the MSS's Gulf of Mexico region once stated that deep water drilling had ""few or no regulations or standards.""[14] Two years later the senior official left his job in the MMS to work for BP.[15] During President Obama's first year in office, as BP's regulatory compliance and environmental manager, the ex-MMS official lobbied the U.S. Ocean Policy Task Force to ""carefully weigh policies that may establish exclusionary zones"" or ""disrupt the MMS leasing program,"" according to a statement posted at whitehouse.gov.[16] He further stated that BP wanted access to off-limit areas such as the eastern Gulf of Mexico[17] which President Obama approved in March 2010.
Total U.S. offshore crude oil production in 2009 was 1.7 million barrels a day, of which 1.6 million barrels a day came from the U.S. section of the Gulf of Mexico.[18]
According to the New York Times, President Obama ""said several times during his presidential campaign that he supported expanded offshore drilling. He noted in his State of the Union address[19] in January [2010] that weaning the country from imported oil would require “tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development.”[20][21]
When questioned about the Obama regulators ""cozy relationship"" with oil companies the president responded, ""absolutely I take responsibility for that.""[22]

Obama administration asks Court to allow BP drilling in the Gulf of Mexico
Less than four months after President Barack Obama took office a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. found that the U.S. Government was unprepared for a major spill at sea, relying on an ""irrational"" environmental analysis of the risks of offshore drilling. The Obama administration urged the court to revisit the decision. In its arguments to the court, the Obama administration said that the loss of royalties on the oil, estimated at almost $10 billion, ""may have significant financial consequences for the federal government."" 
Among the existing leases was the Lease Sale #206. That deal included BP's acquisition, for $34 million, of the acreage encompassing the Deep Water Horizons well.
A day after the administration's petition, the industry's main lobbying group, the American Petroleum Institute, made its own case echoing the government's arguments. ""The significance of [Gulf of Mexico] activities under the five-year program cannot be overstated,"" the API argued.
Secretary Ken Salazar expressed confidence that problems within the Minerals Management Service that led to poor oversight of offshore drilling were resolved. In September 2009, in testimony before the House Natural Resources Committee, Salazar listed steps he had taken to make sure problems ""don't occur in the future.""
In Senate hearings held in mid-November 2009, Obama MMS Deputy Director Walter Cruickshank assured the Committee panel fears of containing a catastrophic blowout were misplaced, saying the U.S. had ""what we believe is the most aggressive oil spill contingency planning...in the world.""[23]

Approval of BP's response plan
The Obama administration accepted and approved BP's regional oil spill response plan for the Gulf of Mexico dated 30 June 2009[24] and covered all the company’s operations in the Gulf. The plan lists 

“Sea Lions, Seals, Sea Otters [and] Walruses” as “Sensitive Biological Resources” in the Gulf, suggesting that portions were cribbed from previous Arctic exploratory planning;
 Gives a web site for a Japanese home shopping site as the link to one of its “primary equipment providers for BP in the Gulf of Mexico Region [for] rapid deployment of spill response resources on a 24 hour, 7 days a week basis;” and
 Directs its media spokespeople to never make “promises that property, ecology, or anything else will be restored to normal.”[25]
The government approved plan made no mention about tracking sub-surface oil plumes from deepwater blowouts or preventing disease (viruses, bacteria, etc.) transmission to captured animals in rehabilitation facilities.

British Petroleum
During the first 100 days of the Obama administration, the Minerals Management Service (MMS) of the Department of the Interior granted a “categorical exclusion” from a detailed environmental impact statement required under law[26] to BP's Deepwater Horizon drilling operation, according to the Washington Post.[27] BP's exploration plan received in the Administration's MMS field office on 23 March 2009 states ""no mitigation measures other than those required by regulation and BP policy will be employed to avoid, diminish or eliminate potential impacts on environmental resources."" It declared any spill would have only ""sub-lethal"" effects on fish and marine mammals but it was ""unlikely that an accidental oil spill would occur from the proposed activities.""[28]
As Senator, and while running for president, Barack Obama received a total of $77,051 from BP[29] and has taken more money from BP's Political Action Committee and individuals connected with BP over the past 20 years than any other candidate, according to FEC disclosure records.[30] Likewise, the independent watchdog Center for Responsive Politics noted, ""the “top recipient of BP-related donations during the 2008 cycle was President Barack Obama himself.”[31][32]

 Obama approved drilling permits for BP without the statutory requirement to file an environmental impact assessment,[33] the handling of spills in a worst-case scenario,[34] and fostered a cozy relationship between government and the oil industry.[35] No other candidate took more money from BP in the past two decades than Obama received in only six years.[36]
Talk show personality Ed Schultz of MSNBC reiterated a call for campaign finance reform as a result of Barack Obama's ties to BP and the government's response.[37]
Transocean, owner of the Deepwater Horizons drilling rig leased to BP, was the recipient of the Obama Mineral Management Service's, Safety Award for Excellence.[38][39] On 30 April 2010 Transocean's stock fell after President Obama’s chief strategist, David Axelrod, made comments nine days into the disaster and the government raised estimates to more than fives times of what had previously been reported about how much oil was leaking into the Gulf of Mexico.[40]
It has been reported in the financial press that among owners of BP[41] are 

New Jersey Division of Investment (51 million shares)
California Public Employees Retirement System (36 million shares)
Pennsylvania Public School Employees Retirement System (7.1 million shares)
Teachers Retirement System of Alabama (4.5 million shares)
Employees Retirement System of Texas (4.1 million shares)
Ohio Public Employees Retirement System (1.1 million shares)
Illinois State Board of Investment (1.1 million shares)[42]
Indiana Public Employees' Retirement Fund (0.7 million shares)
Washington State Investment Board (1.2 million shares)
United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (21.9 million shares). 
BP was found wilfully negligent during the Bush administration in a Texas refinery explosion incident, and was assessed $108 million in fines - the highest workplace safety fines in U.S. history.[43]

Nalco and Corexit
 Dermatitis is one immediate health concern[44] of the Obama administration's decision to use toxic substances to disperse the visibility of the spill.  [4] Residents, cleanup workers, and tourists alike may be affected. [5]
Nalco of Naperville, Illinois formed a joint venture with Exxon Chemical in 1994 and the company's current leadership includes several executives from BP. Nalco reported it sold in excess of $40 million to BP of its dispersant, Corexit, shortly after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster.
Of 18 dispersants approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 12 were found to be more effective on southern Louisiana crude than Corexit, EPA data show.[45] Two of the 12 were found to be 100 percent effective on Gulf of Mexico crude, whereas two Corexit products rated only 56 percent and 63 percent effective.[46] The toxicity of the other 12 was shown to be in some cases 10 or 20 times less than Corexit, according to the EPA.[47] ""It's a chemical that the oil industry makes to sell to itself, basically,"" said Richard Charter, a senior policy adviser for Defenders of Wildlife.[48]
Corexit was found to be one of the most toxic dispersal agents ever developed.[49] With seasonal warming of water temperature the toxicity grows.  Corexit is banned in the United Kingdom due to environmental concerns.[50] The Obama EPA gave BP the green light to apply Corexit to the spill.[51]  At the Congressional hearing investigating the Gulf oil spill disaster, Democratic Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York raised the prospect of ""thousands and thousands of people getting sick or dying"" as a result of the administration's sanctioned use of the dispersant.[52] Critics allege use of dispersants like Corexit are largely for cosmetic purposes. Nalco has been a frequent contributor to the campaign of Sen. Mary Landrieu[53] of Louisiana.[54]

Deepwater Horizon
 Fire boat response crews battle the blazing remnants of the off shore oil rig Deepwater Horizon, April 21, 2010 (U.S. Coast Guard)
On Earth Day 2010, a BP-leased oil drilling rig sank to the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico two days after it exploded, creating what has been described as the ""worst environmental disaster in US history.""[55] Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar told CNN ""It potentially is catastrophic,"" and ""I think we have to prepare for the worst.""[56][57]
Congressional investigators think they have identified the rigs blowout preventer as the cause of the explosion.[58] The blowout preventer was leaking hydraulic fluid, had a dead battery,[59] and was inspected by the Obama Minerals Management Service (MMS) only two weeks before to the explosion[60] which killed 11 people. Amy Goodman, a leftist radio talk show host, has suggested those responsible should be prosecuted for manslaughter.[61]
Blowout preventers are meant to shut off the well, and the last line of defense is a set of shear rams which cut the pipe and seal off the well.[62] The MMS, the Obama administration agency that regulates offshore drilling along with the Coast Guard, is supposed to require  proof that shear rams are powerful enough to shut the well. Michael Saucier, MMS's regional supervisor testified before Congress that the MMS did not require BP to file a ""scenario for potential blowout.""[63] The MMS certified that BP ""has the capacity to respond, to the maximum extent practicable, to a worst-case discharge, or a substantial threat of such a discharge.""[64]
A May 2010 Inspector General's report revealed at least two MMS regulatory inspectors admitted to being under the influence of the illegal drug methamphetamine while on the job.[65][66]

Environmental disaster
 Projections of the flow of the spill over the summer of 2010. [6]
On 29 April 2010 oil began washing ashore in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana; four weeks later local leaders still were begging President Obama for federal assistance in responding to the disaster which was overtaking hundreds of miles of shoreline.[67]
Crude oil has washed into marshes, estuaries and onto beaches in Mississippi and Alabama. Wildlife has been killed and efforts are underway to save oil-coated
birds. Without capping the well Florida's Everglades may be turned into a ""dead zone."" Scientists expect currents to carry the oil slick to the eastern seaboard of the United States, fouling beaches and estuaries like the Chesapeake Bay and fishing grounds of the Grand Banks off Newfoundland.

Silverfish
Most scientists agree that Corexit 9500 will have a much larger biological effect when it reaches coastal areas teeming with wildlife.[68]  Many species are being threatened at a crucial time in their life cycle.[69] In testing done by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency the dispersant Corexit 9500 was found to be extremely lethal to silverfish, a benchmark organism in toxicity testing.[70]

Gulf menhaden
Gulf menhaden are a species harvested mostly for fish meal and fish oil. Menhaden could be badly affected
by the spill.

Coral, oyster and shrimp
Corals, oyster and shrimp likewise are critically affected. Richard Charter, a foremost expert on marine biology and oil spills who is a senior policy advisor for Marine Programmes for Defenders of Wildlife and is chairman of the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary Advisory Council has said, “There is a chemical toxicity to the dispersant compound that in many ways is worse than oil,” which ""in so doing you may be more seriously damaging the ecosystem offshore.”[71] Shrimp were found to be extremely vulnerable to the lethal effects of the chemical dispersant Corexit 9500 used by Obama administration disaster relief agencies and BP in testing done by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).[72]

Brown pelican
 Dead birds and sea turtles.
The Louisiana state bird, the Brown Pelican, was removed from protection under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 2009. The Obama administration approved BP's Deepwater Horizon drilling rig without the proper environmental impact assessment (EIA) required by law. The disaster occurred just as breeding season commenced.

Other bird species
Other species endangered by the oil spill are American oystercatcher and Wilson's plover.

Sea turtles
As several species of sea turtles move through the Gulf during their spring nesting season, they need to surface to breathe.

Toxic oil spill rain
A report prepared by the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources warned that the leaking crude oil into  the Gulf of Mexico is about to become the worst environmental catastrophe in all of human history, threatening the entire eastern half of North America with “total destruction.” Russian scientists based the assessment on the use of millions of gallons of the government approved chemical dispersant Corexit. 
The Russian scientists outlined that Corexit, with its 2.61ppm toxicity level,  combined with the seasonal warming of Gulf of Mexico waters, the molecules will be able to “phase transition” from their present liquid to a gaseous state allowing them to be absorbed into clouds and released as “toxic rain” upon all of Eastern North America.
The scientists warned should a Hurricane Katrina like storm form in the Gulf while tens of millions of gallons of Corexit are floating on or near the surface, the resulting “toxic rain” falling upon the North American continent could “theoretically” destroy all microbial life to any depth it reaches resulting in an “unimaginable environmental catastrophe” destroying all kinds of life forms.[73]

The response
Initially Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Coast Guard reported on 23 April 2010 there was no leak from the sunken oil rig.[74] The next day the Obama administration officially estimated a leak from the sunken well at 1000 barrels per day.[75] The Associated Press reported it took nine days after the explosion and the tragic loss of 11 workers lives before Obama made public commenta and acknowledged the disaster[76] and appointed a national incident commander.[77]
BP's stock fell[78] on news of the ""the worsening oil spill. "" Administration estimates were raised to 5000 barrels per day.[79]

U.S. Government dumps toxic dispersants into the Gulf of Mexico
 After President Obama's approval of the Deepwater Horizon's drilling rig permit and regulatory failures costing 11 workers their lives, the flow of oil into the Gulf of Mexico continued unabated for 86 days.
Wired Science reports the Obama administration disaster-relief agencies are using a toxic chemical to disperse oil in the Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster. Use of dispersants are said to be a public relations strategy.[80] Secretary Janet Napolitano of the Department of Homeland Security acknowledged[81] the U.S government was dumping toxic chemicals from C-130 cargo aircraft onto the spill.[82] Jackie Savitz of the ocean-conservation group Oceana stated the use of dispersants is only slightly less horrendous than the Gulf oil spill itself. ""You're basically pouring chemicals into the ocean, which is never a good thing.""[83] According to a 2009 Environmental Protection Agency report dispersants have not been used in the United State prior to the Obama administration's approval at BP'S request ""because of possible long-term environmental effects, difficulties with timely and effective application, disagreement among scientists and research data about their environmental effects, effectiveness, and toxicity concerns"" and the effects ""are still unknown.""[84] Residents in areas close to the oil spill have reported odors and symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, nausea, eye irritation, and respiratory problems.[85]

Disregard for worker safety
 Cleanup workers exposed to the Obama adminsitration's decision to use known toxic substances to disperse the spill. Critics allege dispersants are ineffective and largely for cosmetic purposes.
The Guardian (uk) has reported the controversy over Corexit exposes the Obama administration to criticism that its scientific agencies have been too accommodating to BP's strategy. In addition to the use of Corexit, the Obama Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) came under fire for withholding test results on the toxicity of the water close to shore.[86]
The dispersant 2-BE is known to cause heath dangers to clean up workers[87] and wildlife alike.[88] 2-BE has been documented to cause the breakdown of red blood cells, leading to blood in  urine and feces, and can damage the kidneys, liver, spleen and bone marrow of humans – effects not included on the information sheet for workers.[89] The dispersant Corexit 9500 is associated with headaches, vomiting and reproductive problems as sides effects to clean-up workers.[90] Lawrence Duffy of the University of Alaska claims dispersants ""are more a public relations measure than a preventive one. It has an effect on our psychology because we don't see the oil slick,""[91] though oil particles continue to do damage.[92]

Government mismanagement of relief efforts
Three weeks into the disaster National Public Radio reported the Obama administration's official figures were still grossly underestimated[93] and after the first month it was finally admitted the spill was nearly three times larger than earlier thought.[94]
Federal officials did not begin burning the leaking oil off the surface of the water until one full week after the rig collapsed.[95] Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal criticized President Obama for his slow response.[96] The New York Times castigated the White House for delays and not moving quick enough, calling the evidence ""damning"" and declaring the Gulf oil spill a ""huge disaster whose consequences might have been minimized with swifter action"" from the Obama administration.[97] One month into the spill, Democratic stalwarts James Carville,[98] Chris Matthews,[99] and Donna Brazile[100] criticized the inept and bungled response to the spreading catastrophe.

The White House lacked any type of plan to combat the disaster. House Democratic Majority Leader Steny Hoyer publicly admitted that the Obama Administration was ill-prepared to deal with the situation.[103]  While the disaster steadily grew, Obama did not discuss the crisis at length until he appeared at a photo op at Venice, Louisiana on 3 May 2010.[104]   He would order a moratorium on all future deep sea oil platforms until they determine the problems associated with the current situation. As to be expected, Obama tries to remove himself from blame saying ""the system failed"", this despite the fact the he heads the system. Then he pointed fingers of blame at oil companies while taking an indirect jab at the Bush administration.[105]



 “

 For too long, for a decade or more, there has been a cozy relationship between the oil companies and the federal agency that permits them to drill. It seems as if permits were too often issued based on little more than assurances of safety from the oil companies. That cannot and will not happen anymore.

 ”


White House spokesman Robert Gibbs did his best to put a good spin on the disaster claiming the response was ""comprehensive and fast.""  Meanwhile, the Democrat-led Congress ordered public hearings from oil executives. President Obama blamed others saying the answers from oil executives were a ""ridiculous spectacle,"" ""You had executives of BP and Transocean and Halliburton falling over each other to point the finger of blame at somebody else."" [106] As the disaster progressed and questions arose over the government's misreporting and withholding[107] of information from the public about the true dimensions of the calamity, the Associated Press noted, 



 “

 First [Obama] was going to make BP pay for the Gulf oil mess. Then he declared himself in charge. Now he's trying to find out 'whose ass to kick' and making clear he'd fire BP's chief if only he could.[108]

Revitalizing cap and trade energy tax
Main article: Cap and trade
President Obama has been roundly criticized by Democrats and Republicans alike for attempting to use the national tragedy to revitalized his failed Cap and Trade energy proposals. The Obama proposal, widely perceived as a job-killer tax increase, has stalled in the U.S. Senate. California Senator Dianne Feinstein has stated the climate bill ""isn't going to stop the oil leak.""[109]
Environmentalists want the President to push the program. Fred Krupp of the Environmental Defense Fund calls the opportunity ""a political moment"" to pass a carbon tax estimated to cost the average U.S. household $4300 per year.[110]
Joel Benenson, who conducted polling for Obama’s presidential campaign, thinks the tax increase could pass, but wary Senate Democrats say otherwise. “There’s not a great call for it"" said West Virginia Democratic Senator Jay Rockefeller. “It’s unrelated” to the immediate crisis in the Gulf noted Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat from Nebraska.[111]


Assistance of foreign governments
Nearly two-months after the disaster took place, the Obama administration decides to utilize the assistance offered by 17 countries, the U.N and the European Union.[112] International aid offers already accepted include two skimmers and 2.6 miles (4.2 kilometers) of boom from Mexico, three sets of sweeping arm systems from the Netherlands and 1.86 miles (3.0 kilometers) of boom from Canada, the State Department said. The State Department noted that it has assisted BP in directly sourcing equipment and technical experts from around the world, including from Algeria, Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Latvia, Norway, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom.[113]

Public relations offensive
Faced with declining poll numbers and a public relations calamity, President Obama took to the airwaves nearly 60 days into the spill. A New York Times Op-ed commented,



 “

 All we got from President Obama was a vague call for some sort of new energy policy. Plus a Gulf Coast Restoration Plan, an oil spill study commission, a reminder that the secretary of energy won a Nobel Prize in physics and 17 references to God, prayer, blessings or faith.[114][115]

 ”


Former speechwriter for President Jimmy Carter, Chris Matthews, chided the President after his address to the nation,



 “

 Ludicrous that he keeps saying [Secretary of Energy] Chu has a Nobel prize. I'll barf if he does it one more time.[116]

 ”


Misrepresentation of evidence
Drilling moratorium based on junk science
The Washington Post reported in November 2010 the oil spill that damaged the Gulf of Mexico's reefs and wetlands also threatens to stain the Obama administration's reputation for relying on science to guide policy. The Department of Interior's concluded that the White House edited a drilling safety report in a way that made it falsely appear that scientists and experts backed the administration's six-month moratorium on new deep-water drilling. The editing changes by the White House resulted ""in the implication that the moratorium recommendation had been peer reviewed."" But it hadn't been. Outside scientists were asked only to review new safety measures for offshore drilling.[117]
In October 2010 the Presidential Oil Spill Commission said that the White House Office of Management and Budget delayed publication of a scientific report that forecast how much oil could reach the gulf's shores. The report said that President Obama's energy adviser and Socialist International operative Carol Browner,[118] mischaracterized on national TV a government analysis about where the oil went, saying it showed most of the oil was ""gone."" It also said Browner and the head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Jane Lubchenco, contributed to the public's perception that the report was more exact than it was.
Academics, environmentalists and federal investigators have accused the administration since the April 2010 spill of downplaying scientific findings, misrepresenting data and misconstruing the opinions of experts it solicited.[119]

Economic impacts
 Oil slick map as of May 30, 2010.
The economic impact of the Gulf of Mexico oil drilling disaster will be large and devastating to several key industries, including fishing, tourism, and transportation.[120]
The top commercial species in terms of value are shrimp ($367 million), menhaden ($64 million), oysters ($59 million), and blue crab ($38 million).[121] As of 25 May 2010, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) closed 54,096 square miles to commercial and recreational fishing.[122] These areas are some of the richest fishing grounds in the Gulf of Mexico for major commercial species such as white shrimp, blue crab, and oysters.

Employment in fishing
The most immediate economic impact of the oil spill has been on the Gulf fishing[123] industry. The number of jobs at stake, which includes seafood processing and related wholesale and retail, is over 200,000 with related economic activity of $5.5 billion.[124]
Dockside sales in Louisiana are approximately $660 million.[125] Loses to the Louisiana fishing could  be as high as $2.5 billion.[126]

Employment in tourism
The tourist industry employs 620,000 people who earn over $9 billion in wages in the Gulf of Mexico region. Analysts say Florida alone could lose $3 billion in tourism.[127]
In 2008, recreational anglers took 25.4 million fishing trips and spent over $12 billion on equipment and trips in the Gulf region.[128] Some of the most popular recreational species include snappers, several types of drum, sheepshead, and Spanish mackerel. Recreational fisheries support businesses such as charters, bait and tackle, and services such as restaurants and hotels. 
In 2000, 21.9 million people visited Gulf beaches and accounted for 177.2 million beach days.[129]

Transportation
The Offshore Marine Service Association (OMSA),[130] the national trade association for U.S. flag vessels in the energy sector, criticized the Obama administration's moratorium on offshore drilling projects. 100,000 jobs were immediately affected by the president's decision as companies began cancelling contracts to carry supplies, forcing layoffs. ""The industry has struggled to climb out of a severe economic downturn. The moratorium threatens any hope of recovery and creates the potential for economic hardship that could last a decade or longer,"" remarked OMSA President Ken Wells.
OMSA estimates that for every mariner who works on board a vessel, there are nine other Americans working in shore-side jobs that support vessel operations. Beyond the vessel crew, the negative consequences of the moratorium could impact everyone from service technicians supporting everything from diesel engines to the air condition systems to the local grocer who supplies food for the boat's galley.
Offshore vessels are a major part of the tax base in many coastal communities. Gulf Coast state and local government revenues will also decrease due to lower income tax and sales tax collections.
Disruption of shipping traffic in and out of the Port of New Orleans will impact barge, container, and tanker traffic in the Mississippi Delta and along the Mississippi River.  Prices of all types of commodities would affected.

Insurance industry
BP, the operator on the oil drilling lease with a 65% stake, insured itself, rather than buying coverage from insurance companies. Industry analysts estimate total costs related to the oil spill cleanup and damages could exceed $14 billion.[131]

Lost revenue to state and local governments
Louisiana
A Greater New Orleans study indicates the Obama administration's moratorium could cost Louisiana as many as 22,000 jobs and more than $782 million in revenues.
With the average deepwater rig employing 230 workers with an average salary of $98,000, the study puts the tax revenue impact at $151 million if drilling were to resume within 18 months. Greater New Orleans President and CEO Michael Hecht says it’s difficult to be optimistic based on President Obama’s Oval Office address on 15 June 2010. President Obama's action “has the potential to turn an ecological tragedy into an economic calamity,” Hecht said.[132] The study foresees in a worse case scenario the loss of more than 22,000 jobs, 3,450 of them directly tied to the operating rigs and 18,945 with indirect ties such as catering firms and other companies that serve U.S energy producers.
Fearing that the drilling moratorium ""could exacerbate, rather than alleviate, the impacts of this spill upon both our economy and our environment,"" U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu wrote to President Obama on 11 June 2010.[133] Landrieu stated, 



 “

 more than 300,000 Louisianians are employed either directly or indirectly by the oil and gas industry. ..The immediate impacts to the economy are devastating enough: idling the 33 rigs currently permitted to drill in the deepwater Gulf would immediately impact employment for roughly 38,000 crewmen, deck hands, engineers, welders, ROV operators, caterers, helicopter pilots, and others who operate and service these vessels. That's like closing 12 large motor vehicle assembly plants in one state, all at once.

 ”


Lost state and local tax revenues will accrue at a rate between $8 million and $15 million a month. Federal royalty losses will be substantial and a significant drop in tolls collected for the Louisiana Highway 1 bridge at Leeville, the main artery to the Port Fourchon energy port is projected as well.

Texas
The Texas state comptroller’s office reported collection of $2.3 billion in oil and natural gas production taxes in fiscal year 2009 and $4.1 billion in 2008. The tax revenue is used to repair roads and fund schools, among other state services. Although no official analysis of President Obama's decision to place a moratorium on offshore production has been compiled yet, the Texas comptroller’s office said it’s unclear how much of an impact the president's decision will have on state services. Experts warn the president's decision could threaten tens of thousands of jobs in the Houston area.[134]

Alabama
Manufacturing jobs in Alabama are at risk as a result of President Obama's actions, as no new orders for equipment are coming in.[135]

Increased dependency on foreign oil
New Jersey Democrat Senator Robert Menendez proposed a ban on new offshore drilling permits and submitted a bill that would retroactively raise the financial liability of BP from $75 million to $10 billion.[136] Oklahoma Republican Senator James Inhofe successfully killed the bill saying it would reduce competition and shut down smaller independent oil companies in favor of larger companies.

Too big to fail
An oil industry trade publication[137] reports President Obama and senior White House staff, as well as Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, are working with BP on legislation that would raise the cap on liability for damage claims from those affected by the oil disaster from $75 million to $10 billion. However the disaster has the real potential of costing nearly $1 trillion. Critics point out that in the deal between Obama and BP, $10 billion is a drop in the bucket for a trillion dollar disaster. Talk is noted in government circles, including FEMA, of the need to nationalize BP in order to compensate those who will ultimately be affected by the worst oil disaster in the history of the world, and BP would, if its assets were nationalized, be credited with almost a trillion dollars for compensation purposes.[138][139]
After Obama charged Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate the disaster, BP establish a $20 billion extrajudicial fund managed by an Obama appointee.[140] Former CNN news writer and radio talk show host Mike Malloy suggested Holder is beholden to corporatist interests.[141]

Criticism of the Obama administration's handling of the disaster
 Memorial service for the 11 workers killed in the explosion.Reuters [8]
Former top adviser to President Bill Clinton, James Carville, turned visibly emotional in an interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC's Good Morning America over President Barack Obama's ""lackadaisical"" response to the Gulf oil spill disaster. 



 “

 The political stupidity is unbelievable. ... The President of the United States  could have come down here. He could have been involved with the families of these 11 people...... He could have implemented a plan in anticipation of this... He could be commandeering tankers and making BP bring tankers in and clean this up.... He could be deploying people to the coast. He could be with the corps of engineers and the Coast Guard with these people in Plaquemines Parish, doing something about these regulations. These people are crying. They're begging for something down here. And it just looks like he's not involved in this! Man, you have got to get down here and take control of this! Put somebody in charge of this and get this thing moving! We're about to die down here![142][143][144]

 ”


Carville also said in a separate interview on CNN with Anderson Cooper,



 “

 They are risking everything by this ‘go along with BP’ strategy they have. They seem, like, lackadaisical on this...they seem like they’re inconvenienced by this, this is some giant thing getting in their way and somehow or another, if you let BP handle it, it’ll all go away. It’s not going away. It’s growing out there. It is a disaster of the first magnitude...the government thinks that they are partnering with BP. I think they actually believe that BP has some kind of a good motivation here. That’s one of the, sort of, whole flaws is they're naïve.[145][146]

 ”


Obama acknowledged the criticism days later in a televised press conference:



 “

 Where I was wrong was in my belief that the oil companies had their act together when it came to worst-case scenarios.[147]

 ”


 Day 12 of the Disaster: Obama enjoys an evening of levity and banter with the Washington Press Corps at the White House Correspondent's Dinner.
MSNBC talk show host Chris Matthews[148] said on Jay Leno's Tonight Show,



 “

 The president scares me. He's been acting a little like a Vatican Observer here. When is he actually going to do something? And I worry. I know he doesn't want to take ownership of it. I know politics. He said the minute he says, 'I'm in charge,' he takes the blame.[149]

 ”


Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential campaign manager in 2008 questioned if Democratic primary voters had 



 “

 underestimated the value of experience and crisis management as important attributes for their president.[150]

 ”


Donna Brazile, who managed the presidential campaign of Democratic candidate Al Gore in 2000 said on ABC's This Week,



 “

 One of the problems I have with the administration is that they're not tough enough. They are waiting for BP to say, ‘oh, we've got a new plan to stop the oil leak.’ They need to stop it, contain it, clean it up, and try to help us conserve our coastal wetlands.[151]

 ”


Dick Morris, an intimate adviser to President Bill Clinton observed,



 “

 these failings show that Obama is in over his head. But to the left, which bleeds for each drop of water in the gulf and cries over every turtle or shrimp or sea bird, it is an unpardonable sin...Obama's incompetence and inexperience is causing liberals to see him as arrogant, aloof, removed, conceited, suspicious of outside advice and even lazy...these character defects will haunt the president until 2012 and beyond.[152]

 ”


David Gergen worked in the Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Clinton White House remarked,



 “

 If our government had fought WWII like the way we’re fighting the oil spill, there’s a good chance many of us would be speaking German today.[153]

 ”


Republican Chairman Michael Steele criticized the president for golfing while the oil crisis worsened.[154]



 “

 Until this problem is fixed, no more golf outings.

 ”


Peggy Noonan, a speech writer for President's Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, summed up public perceptions with,



 “

 The president, in my view, continues to govern in a way that suggests he is chronically detached from the central and immediate concerns of his countrymen.... he has not, almost from the day he was inaugurated, been in sync with the center....The American people have spent at least two years worrying that high government spending would, in the end, undo the republic. They saw the dollars gushing night and day...And now we have a videotape metaphor for all the public’s fears: the well gushing black oil into the Gulf of Mexico ...His philosophy is that it is appropriate for the federal government to occupy a more burly, significant and powerful place in America—confronting its problems of need, injustice, inequality. ... Then the oil spill came and government could not do the job, could not meet the need ...Katrina illustrate[d] that even though the federal government in our time has continually taken on new missions and responsibilities, the more it took on, the less it seemed capable of performing even its most essential jobs. Conservatives got this point—they know it without being told—but liberals and progressives did not. They thought Katrina was the result only of George W. Bush’s incompetence and conservatives’ failure to “believe in government.” But Mr. Obama was supposed to be competent....It’s not good to have a president in this position—weakened, polarizing and lacking broad public support—less than halfway through his term. That it is his fault is no comfort.[155]

 ”


New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd wrote,



 “

 Obama and top aides who believe in his divinity make a mistake to dismiss complaints of his aloofness as Washington white noise. He treats the press as a nuisance rather than examining his own inability to encapsulate Americans’ feelings.[156]

 ”


Actor Robert Redford demanded action from the Obama administration. The liberal special interest group Natural Resources Defense Council has Redford in a new ad decrying the lackluster response.[157] Redford made an appearance on MSNBC and said there is no one manning this ship,



 “

 In this case, we don’t need a disaster manager, we need a leader.

 ”


Liberal Hollywood director James Cameron says;



 “

 Over the last few weeks I've watched, as we all have, with growing horror and heartache, watching what's happening in the Gulf and thinking those morons don't know what they're doing.[158]

 ”


Obnoxious Hollywood liberal Rosie O'Donnell said, ""We broke the womb of freaking mother Earth.""  [159] In addition, O'Donnell accused BP of



 “

 willful homicide, willful mass murder"" and demanded BP be nationalized immediately: ""I say seize their assets. Right now. Seize their assets today. Take over the company.

 ”


Brad Pitt, appears in a Spike Lee film denouncing the oil spill and his desire to see BP executives get the death penalty.[160]


Foreign reaction
Relations between allies the U.K. and U.S. are now at historic lows thanks to Barack Obama's mishandling of the oil spill. Britain had been repeatedly mocked by Obama prior to the spill[161][162][163] but now find themselves subjected to endless propaganda. Prominent foreign dignitaries have expressed the public's growing frustration with the administration's posturing and hunt for scapegoats. The mayor of London, Boris Johnson, who supported Obama in 2008, decried ""anti-British rhetoric, buck-passing and name-calling"" while Lord Tebbit branded Mr Obama's conduct “despicable” and the president's rhetoric 



 “

 a crude, bigoted, xenophobic display of partisan political Presidential petulance.""[164][165]

 ”


The atmosphere Obama created in Britain is so toxic that the British press has labelled Barack Obama the most unpopular man in England.[166]

2012 Presidential Election,https://www.conservapedia.com/2012_Presidential_Election,"The Presidential Election 2012 was held on Tuesday, November 6, 2012.  By relying on extensive early voting driven by the Democrat political machine—which totaled more than 40% of the vote -- Barack Obama defeated Mitt Romney despite losing nearly 10 million votes from 2008, carrying fewer states and a smaller proportion of both the electoral vote and the popular vote than he had before.  Thus, Obama's ""victory"" was smaller in magnitude by four different measures than in 2008.
Obama was leading in the polls by a substantial margin until the first presidential debate, which Romney won by the widest margin ever recorded by Gallup polling.  Afterward Romney surpassed Obama and was leading by 49-48% in both the Rasmussen and Gallup polls on Election Day.
As Conservapedia anticipated, this election was similar to the election of 1948, when the RINO Thomas Dewey was unable to attract grassroots voters despite the unpopularity of Harry Truman and the deteriorating economy.  A handful of swing states selected the winner in both instances.



Issue or Factor

Mitt Romney

Barack Obama

Comment


Social issues

Romney has downplayed social issues, but supports defunding Planned Parenthood and would likely nominate more conservative judges.

Obama is vocally pro-abortion, pro-same-sex marriage, and pro-homosexual agenda.

As with Tom Dewey's loss in 1948, Romney's running away from social issues could cost him the election.


Economic issues

Romney favors free enterprise, low taxes, and personal responsibility.

Obama says he inherited the crisis from Republicans.

The advantage here is Romney's.


Leadership

Romney was head of Bain Capital, was Governor of Massachusetts and led the 2002 Olympics.

Obama took advantage of  Hurricane Sandy to create an impression that he was a competent leader, but, a week after the storm, its effects are still being felt.

Both candidates have proven leadership skills, but Obama's response to Hurricane Sandy is being celebrated by the liberal press.


Likability

Romney's likability rating stands at only 31%, and has been lower.

Obama's likability rating is at 48%.

Advantage to Obama.


Debates

Romney is a good debater.

Obama struggles without a teleprompter, but will benefit from liberal moderators.

Advantage to Romney.


VPs

Paul Ryan has youth, energy, and likability, but is part of the Big Government Republican leadership in Congress, which has an ultra-low approval rating; Romney has been criticized for not using Ryan more effectively in the campaign.[1]

Joe Biden is a gaffe-prone goofball, but is protected by the liberal media.

Toss-up here, or maybe a slight edge to Ryan.


Fundraising

Mitt did not turn out to be as strong a fundraiser as expected, nor were the Super PACs effective on his side; some of their comments to the press, like Karl Rove criticizing Todd Akin, were actually hurtful.

Limousine liberals have donated millions to Obama's reelection, and once again the Dems outspend the Republicans.

Advantage to Obama.


Gaffes/staying on message

47% of American don't pay income tax and won't vote for me[2][3]/London Olympics not ready comment[4]

""You didn't build that""

Obama has a media covering up his gaffes any way they can, but Romney has better control of his message. Advantage to Romney.

Following the 2012 Republican Primaries the Republican National Convention nominated the RINO Mitt Romney for president and Paul Ryan for vice president, and their strategy appears to be to duck and avoid social issues as much as possible.  The selection and Paul Ryan as VP and polling during the first half of the convention showed only a slight bounce in voter support for Romney.

History
No incumbent has won reelection in the past 70 years with unemployment above 7.2%; reported unemployment is at 7.9% (and real unemployment much higher).[5]

Campaign strategy
Both campaigns have focused on key battleground states: Florida, Ohio, Virginia.[6] A CNN summary of poll of likely voters taken just before the first debate had Obama leading Romney in Florida, 47% to 46%, in Virginia 48% to 46% and in Ohio 52% to 43%.[6]
Romney made a last-minute effort in Pennsylvania, including both ads and personal appearances, but Obama ultimately won Pennsylvania's electoral votes.  The October 25 Rasmussen poll in Pennsylania had the state 51% for Obama and 46% for Romney, but the last minute effort did not move enough voters to change the outcome.[7]

Debates
The Commission on Presidential Debates is sponsoring four debates.[9] Although many candidates will appear on the ballot in some states, the Commission is limiting participation in the debates to just candidates that appear on enough states to be mathematically eligible to win the presidency. Candidates also must gain at least 15% support in five national polls as of the date of determination, to be some time after Labor Day 2012.[10] The debates are:

Wednesday October 3: The first presidential debate took place at the University of Denver in Denver, Colorado,[11] moderated by Jim Lehrer[12]
Thursday October 11: The vice-presidential debate took place at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky,[11] moderated by Martha Raddatz of ABC News[12]
Tuesday October 16: The second presidential debate (with a town-hall meeting format) took place at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York.[11] moderated by Candy Crowley of CNN.[12][13]
Monday October 22: The third and final presidential debate on foreign policy took place at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Florida,[11] moderated by Bob Schieffer of CBS News.[12]
An independent presidential debate, sponsored by the Free and Equal Elections Foundation and moderated by former CNN host Larry King, took place on October 23, 2012, at the Hilton Hotel in Chicago, Illinois. President Obama and Governor Romney declined invitations, while Johnson, Goode, Stein and Anderson participated.[14] A second independent debate took place on October 30 in Washington, D.C.[15]

Minor parties
With record-low support for either major party candidate, this could be a year when minor parties do unusually well.

Constitution Party[16]

Virgil Goode[17]

Popular ex-Congressman from Virginia who had previously won election as a Democrat, Independent, and Republican. Joined the Constitution Party in 2010. Opposes illegal immigration and calls for a reduction in legal immigration as well. Won the Constitution Party nomination for president in April on the first ballot.


Green Party[18]

Jill Stein[19]

Defeated Roseanne Barr for the Green Party nomination. Criticizes Obama for allegedly perpetuating the policies of the Bush administration. Supports the Occupy Wall Street protests.

10 Commandments for drivers,https://www.conservapedia.com/10_Commandments_for_drivers,"The Vatican has issued a set of ""Ten Commandments"" for drivers of vehicles, a document titled ""Guidelines for the Pastoral Care of the Road."" Saying motor vehicles can be an ""occasion of sin."" The 59-page instruction was issued in a 2007 warning by the Pontifical Council for Migrants and Travelers. We are called to be good stewards of the road. The document said drivers need to remember that even when there is no one sitting next to them, they are never alone.
Reasons were backed up by statistics. In the 20th century, about 35 million people lost their lives in road accidents, and 1.5 billion people were injured. In the year 2000 alone, traffic deaths reached nearly 1.3 million. Plus, 90 percent of the accidents were due to human error. [1]

10 Commandments for drivers
1. You shall not kill.
2. The road shall be for you a means of communion between people and not of mortal harm.
3. Courtesy, uprightness and prudence will help you deal with unforeseen events.
4. Be charitable and help your neighbor in need, especially victims of accidents.
5. Cars shall not be for you an expression of power and domination and an occasion of sin.
6. Charitably convince the young and not so young not to drive when they are not in a fitting condition to do so.
7. Support the families of accident victims.
8. Bring guilty motorists and their victims together, at the appropriate time, so that they can undergo the liberating experience of forgiveness.
9. On the road, protect the more vulnerable party.
10. Feel responsible toward others.

The so-called ""City""-class gunboat was several ironclad warships constructed between August 1861 and January 1862 by private contractor James B. Eads for use on the Mississippi River and its tributaries.  The first armored warships to see action during the American Civil War, they would play an integral role in the Western Theater of operations.

2.4 USS Pittsburgh
2.5 USS Mound City
2.6 USS Cincinnati
2.7 USS Louisville




Description
As the Civil War began it was realized early-on that control of the Mississippi was vital to winning the war.  The chief vessel on the river was the paddle-wheel steamer, which was a large passenger-and freight carrying craft designed with a low-water displacement, ideal for the shallow depths of the river.  Eads, a retired engineer who made his fortune salvaging sunken ships, took on the task of building a fleet of seven ships based on a design by Samuel M. Pook.  The low, wide casemated design of the vessels led to the derisive name of ""Pook's Turtles.""  All were completed within a span of six months at an average cost of $101,800 each.  
Originally intended to be named for Union military leaders, Eads was overruled in that respect by the commander of the Western Flotilla, Rear Admiral Andrew H. Foote, who named them after cities and towns along the banks of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers.  Thus, although each vessel was unique in its own regard, they became collectively known as the ""City""-class.
All ships of the ""City""-class were paddle-wheel steamers (the exception was Mound City, which had a screw propeller); their construction on the ways began as typical riverboats.  From the waterline up they were covered with a box-shaped casemate enclosing up to twelve Dahlgren smoothbore guns arranged in broadside fashion, with three poking out of the bow.  Above the casemate stood the conning tower in front, a smaller, rounded casemate at the rear to protect the paddle wheels, and in the center were twin stacks, which had painted bands near the top in a color particular to the vessel, so as to be readily identifiable in battle.

Gunboats
USS Carondelet
 USS Carondelet
Carondelet, an ironclad river gunboat, was built in 1861 by James B. Eads and Company, St. Louis, Mo., under contract to the War Department; commissioned 15 January at Cairo, Illinois, naval Captain H. Walke in command, and reported to Western Gunboat Flotilla (Army), commanded by naval Flag Officer Andrew H. Foote.
Between January and October 1862 Carondelet operated almost constantly on river patrol and in the capture of Forts Henry and Donelson in February; the passing of Island No. 10 and the attack on and spiking of the shore batteries below New Madrid, Missouri in April; the lengthy series of operations against Plum Point Bend, Fort Pillow, and Memphis from April through June, and the engagement with CSS Arkansas on 15 July, during which Carondelet was heavily damaged and suffered 35 casualties.
Transferred to Navy Department control with the other ships of her flotilla on 1 October 1862, Carondelet continued the rapid pace of her operations, taking part in the unsuccessful Steele's Bayou Expedition in March 1863. One of those to pass the Vicksburg and Warrenton batteries in April 1863, Carondelet took part on 29 Aprilin the five and one-half hour engagement with the batteries at Grand Gulf. She remained on duty off Vicksburg, hurling fire at the city in its long siege from May to July. Without her and her sisters and other naval forces, the great operations on the rivers would not have been possible and northern victory might not have been won. From 7 March to 15 May 1864, she sailed with the Red River Expedition, and during operations in support of Army movements ashore, took part in the Bell's Mill engagement of December 1864. For the remainder of the war, Carondelet patrolled in the Cumberland River. She was decommissioned at Mound City, Illinois, 20 June 1865, and sold there 29 November 1865.

USS St. Louis / Baron De Kalb
St. Louis, a stern wheel casemate gunboat was built by Eads in Carondelet, Missouri for the War Department, and launched on 12 October 1861 and joined the Western Gunboat Fleet.
During 1862 St. Louis, under the command of Lieutenant L. Paulding, was attached to Rear Admiral Foote's squadron and participated in the capture of Fort Henry on the Tennessee River (6 February 1862). She served as flagship for the squadron when it assisted the Union Army at the capture of Fort Donelson on the Cumberland River (14-16 February 1862). Between April and June 1862, she operated against Fort Pillow, Tennessee. St. Louis was renamed Baron De Kalb 8 September 1862, and in October 1862 she was transferred to the Navy Department. During 21–28 December she took part in the Yazoo Expedition and participated in the action at Drumgould's Bluff (28 December).
During 1863 Baron De Kalb took part in the capture of Arkansas Post (10-11 January); expedition up the White River (12-14 January); Yazoo Pass Expedition (20 February-5 April); action at Fort Pemberton (11-13 March); action at Haines' Bluff (29 April-2 May, 18 May); action at Yazoo City, Mississippi. (20-23 May); and the Yazoo River Expedition (24-31 May). On 13 July 1963 Baron De Kalb was sunk by a torpedo in the Yazoo River, one mile below Yazoo City.

USS Cairo
Cairo, an ironclad river gunboat, was built in 1861 by Eads and Company, Mound City, Illinois, under an Army contract; and commissioned as an Army ship 25 January 1862, naval Lieutenant James M. Prichett in command.
Cairo served with the Army's Western Gunboat Fleet, commanded by Flag Officer Foote on the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers and their tributaries until transferred to the Navy 1 October 1862 with the other river gunboats. Active in the occupation of Clarksville, Tennessee, 17 February 1862, and of Nashville, 25 February, Cairo stood down the river 12 April escorting mortar boats to begin the lengthy operations against Fort Pillow. An engagement with Confederate gunboats at Plum Point Bend on 11 May marked a series of blockading and bombardment activities which culminated in the abandonment of the Fort by its defenders on 4 June.
Two days later, 6 June 1862, Cairo joined in the triumph of seven Union ships and a tug over eight Confederate gunboats off Memphis, an action in which five of the opposing gunboats were sunk or run ashore, two seriously damaged, and only one managed to escape. That night Union forces occupied the city. Cairo returned to patrol on the Mississippi until 21 November when she joined the Yazoo Expedition. On 12 December 1862, while clearing mines from the river preparatory to the attack on Haines Bluff, Mississippi, Cairo struck an electrically-operated torpedo and sank, the first vessel in history to be sunk by that method.  Her wreck was recovered in 1965, but was badly damaged during the salvage efforts. It has subsequently been partially restored and is on exhibit at Vicksburg, Mississippi.

USS Pittsburgh
The first Pittsburgh (often spelled Pittsburg), a sidewheel, ironclad gunboat, was built under War Department contract by James B. Eads, St. Louis, Mo. in 1861; and commissioned in January 1862, Lt. Egbert Thompson in command.
Joining Flag Officer Andrew H. Foote's Western Gunboat Flotilla in river patrol duty, Pittsburgh attacked Fort Donelson 14 February 1862, and was damaged by counter-fire. The support from the gunboats contributed greatly to the capture of the strategic fort two days later.
Repaired, she attacked Island No. 10 on 3 April, then ran its batteries by dark 7 April being lashed by a heavy thunderstorm as well as the island's 73 guns. This daring feat made it possible for her and Carondelet to demolish batteries below New Madrid that same day, clearing the way for the Army to cross the Mississippi.
Pittsburgh gave continued service in the lengthy series of operations which wrested control of the lower Mississippi from the Confederacy. Her flotilla, previously under Army control, came under naval command 1 October 1862. Highlights of her service were the operations against Plum Point Bend, Fort Pillow and Memphis in April, May and June 1862; the Steele's Bayou Expedition of March 1863; and the passing of the Vicksburg batteries 16 April 1863. She led the attack on the batteries at Grand Gulf 29 April, and was heavily damaged during the five-and-a-half hour engagement which secured Union control of an important stretch of the river, making it possible for Grant to cross the river and attack Vicksburg from the rear. The strong Confederate river fortress surrendered 4 July allowing President Abraham Lincoln at last to report, “The Father of Waters flows unvexed to the sea.”
Patrol and bombardment missions on the Mississippi were interrupted the following year when Pittsburgh joined in the Red River Expedition from March to May 1864. At the close of the war, she decommissioned at Mound City, and was sold there 29 November 1865.

USS Mound City
 USS Mound City
Ironclad screw steamer Mound City, built at St. Louis, Mo., 7 August 1861 by James B. Eads, joined the War Department's flotilla on the western rivers in 1862, Commander A. H. Kilty in command.
Departing Cairo in March, Mound City operated off Island No. 10, the key to the Mississippi, and New Madrid. Pope's army took New Madrid on the 13th, thus removing the strong Confederate network of communications and eliminating a major obstacle to Union control of the upper Mississippi. After the surrender of Island No. 10 on 7 April, Mound City seized Confederate ship Red Rover, damaged by mortar fire. Sent to Cairo, Red Rover was subsequently converted to the Navy's first hospital ship.
Union capture of Fort Pillow 1 April did not entirely eliminate the Confederate resistance; eight Confederate gunboats made a spirited attack on Union gun‑boats and mortars at Plum Point Bend 10 May. Colonel Lovell rammed Mound City, forcing her ashore to avoid sinking. Meanwhile, Union ships bombarded Fort Pillow daily, reducing Confederate will to fight. Speeding to aid rammed and sinking Cincinnati off Ship Island, Mound City was rammed by General Van Dorn, completely wrenching off Mound City’s bow. Her bow replaced at Mound City, the steamer ran up White River in June, engaging Confederate batteries at St. Charles, Arkansas; the complete Union victory at St. Charles gave the Union control of White River, but was costly to Mound City as one shot completely disabled her. In danger of sinking, she was towed from beneath the batteries by Conestoga.
The Union forces met strong southern opposition throughout the summer and abandoned Vicksburg 6 August when Mound City formed part of the White River expedition, escorting transport White Cloud. Union forces regrouped at Helena, from which Mound City departed 16 August with 6 other Union ships and two regiments 2d Brigade, 3d Division, Army of the Southwest on the Yazoo River expedition. The Army‑Navy expedition captured steamer Fairplay 20 miles above Vicksburg, where the ships were unable to proceed due to shallow water.
Meanwhile, McClernand was formulating his plans for the assault on Vicksburg. From October 1862 through March 1863, Mound City was with Pittsburgh, Carondelet, and Louisville as part of the Grand Gulf venture. Passing the upper batteries of Grand Gulf 12 October, the ships completely silenced the lower fort. Mound City, Carondelet, Signal, and Marmora steamed to the mouth of Yazoo River 25 November to prevent southern blockade of it, remaining here on guard duty through March.
Mound City formed part of the Yazoo Pass Expedition via Steele's Bayou 14 March as Union ships attempted to strike the rear defenses of Vicksburg. Returning to more direct action against Vicksburg, Mound City’s bold passage of the batteries 14 April dampened the enthusiasm of Confederate sympathizers along the shore, contributing to early Union seizure of Grand Gulf and the eventual fall of Vicksburg. On the 27th, Mound City joined 7 other Union gunboats in attacks on Grand Gulf.
After attacking Warrenton, Mississippi, 10 May and destroying a battery, she guarded the river from Grand Gulf depot to Hard Times. She returned to Vicksburg 18 June for a 3‑day expedition to Cole's Creek, destroying six or seven small boats. After shelling the batteries at Vicksburg 3 July, she steamed to Lake Providence, Ga., 7 August when she fired on and dispersed Confederate cavalry, thereafter guarding this part of the river.
Off Davis plantation in January 1864, she endeavored to raise Indianola, sunk in Red River in 1862. Seizing tug Rawlins off Natchez 2 March, Mound City joined 17 other ships and Sherman's troops in the Red River Expedition 16 March through 22 May in an effort to enter Texas via Alexandria, Louisiana, to counter the threat from Maximilian. Shallow water proved an obstacle as Mound City and Carondelet grounded near the wing dams across Red River 10 May. Hauled across the upper falls above the obstructions by throngs of straining soldiers, the ships were able to get free. Mound City spent the remainder of the year guarding Indianola.
She joined the expedition to Black River in May 1865, turning back from Baldwin's Perry on learning of an imminent attack. After the end of the conflict, she returned to Mound City for dismantling but was sold there at public auction to Frank Bennet 9 November 1865.

USS Cincinnati
The first Cincinnati, a stern-wheel casemate gunboat, was built in 1861 under a War Department contract by James Eads, St. Louis, Mo., and commissioned at Mound City, 16 January 1862, naval Lieutenant G. M. Bache in command.
Assigned to duty with the Army in the Western Gunboat Flotilla under naval Flag Officer Foote, Cincinnati participated in the attack and capture of Fort Henry (6 February 1862); the operations against Island No. 10 (12 March-7 April 1862); the engagement with the Confederate gunboat fleet at Plum Point Bend and the bombardment of Fort Pillow (10 May 1862). This important series of operations was aimed at splitting the Confederacy. During the last engagement Cincinnati, the lead vessel, was repeatedly struck by enemy rams and sunk.
Raised and returned to service, Cincinnati was transferred to the Navy Department 1 October 1862 with other vessels of the Western Gunboat Flotilla. She participated in the Army-Navy operation against Port of Arkansas and installations on the White River in January 1863, then was ordered to the Yazoo River where she took part in Steele's Bayou Expedition (14-27 March 1863). Joining the attack on the Vicksburg batteries (27 May 1863), Cincinnati came under heavy fire and was sunk for the second time, suffering 40 casualties.
Raised again in August 1863 Cincinnati returned to patrol duty on the Mississippi River and its tributaries until February 1865 when she was transferred to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron. She patrolled off Mobile Bay and in the Mississippi Sounds until placed out of commission 4 August 1865 at Algiers, La. She was sold at New Orleans 28 March 1866.

USS Louisville
Louisville was built at St. Louis, Mo., by J. B. Eads in 1861, under contract with the War Department; was accepted 15 January 1862; and commissioned 16 January 1862, Comdr. Benjamin H. Dove in command.
Part of the War Department's flotilla on the western rivers, Louisville assisted the Army in the capture of Fort Donelson on the Cumberland River 14 to 16 February 1862. From 1 to 5 March, she aided in the occupation of Columbus, Ky., the “Gibraltar of the West.” Departing Cairo, Ill., 14 March, she served in the capture of Island No. 10 and New Madrid, Mo., through 7 April, and helped to prevent southern ships from ascending the river.
In May, Louisville was ordered to Fort Pillow and participated in the Battle of Memphis on 6 June. Commanded by Rear Adm. Charles H. Davis, her squadron captured and sank the Confederate Mississippi flotilla. On 15 June, she attacked the upper batteries at Vicksburg, before shifting efforts to the White River, departing Helena, Ark., 5 August. Escorting Benton and Bragg to the mouth of the river, she met little resistance. On 1 October, she was transferred to the Navy.
After escorting transport Meteor, disembarking troops at Bledsoe's and Hamblen's landings 21 October, Louisville returned to Helena to join the gunboat fleet, Mississippi Squadron.
She joined Baron De Kalb, Cincinnati, Lexington, Signal, New Era, Romeo, Rattler, and Glide later in the month on an expedition up the White River in support of General Sherman's army. Louisville captured the steamer Evansville near Island No. 36 on 1 November.
Louisville aided in the capture of Fort Hindman, Arkansas Post, 4 to 11 January 1863, and formed part of the expedition through Steele's Bayou, 14 to 28 January. She was ordered to the Yazoo River the 31st and moved to stop Confederates felling trees across the bayou on 21 March. She then turned her attention to the batteries on the river, running past those at Vicksburg on 16 April, and engaging the lower ones on the 29th. She joined Pittsburgh, Mound City, and Carondolet on that date, silencing the guns of the fort on Grand Gulf and helping to establish the siege which forced Vicksburg's surrender 4 July 1863.
From 12 March to 22 May 1864, Louisville joined in the expedition up the Red River, La. On 2 June she engaged Confederate batteries 7 miles below Columbia, Ark., silencing the guns. She landed Union troops at Sunnyside 6 June and anchored off Shipwith's Landing the 20th, to learn that Confederates were traveling upriver with a heavy force, and had crossed Cypress Creek and Bartholomew's Bayou 20 June with cavalry, infantry, and artillery. On learning that Parson's brigade was 10 miles back of Gaines’ Landing, providing reinforcements, Louisville departed immediately for that point, and helped break up the Confederate attack.
Louisville continued service on the Mississippi until decommissioning 21 July 1865. She was sold at public auction at Mound City 29 November 1865.

1966 Midterm Elections,https://www.conservapedia.com/1966_Midterm_Elections,"In the midterm election of 1966, the Republican Party gained 47 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and three seats in the U.S. Senate from the Democratic Party. Republicans also gained eight governorships and 557 state legislative seats.
Following President Lyndon B. Johnson's landslide presidential victory in 1964, Democrats had a supermajority in both chambers. Johnson launched the War on Poverty, which included the passage of Medicare and Medicaid and a flood of other liberal legislation. However, public opposition to the Great Society, lack of success in Vietnam and race riots resulted Johnson's popularity to decline. 
Although Democrats retained a clear majority after the election, Johnson lost the liberal mandate and proposed no new major reforms in 1967. Republicans made significant gains in the south for the first time since Reconstruction, with one-third of southern House seats controlled by Republicans. 
Future Republican U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan was elected Governor of California and George H.W. Bush was elected to Congress in Texas. Richard M. Nixon actively campaigned for Republican candidates, which helped propel him to the Presidency.

2010 FIFA World Cup,https://www.conservapedia.com/2010_FIFA_World_Cup,"The 2010 FIFA World Cup was an international Soccer tournament held in South Africa and won by Spain.[1]
Bidding contests for FIFA World Cups are extremely competitive.  After Germany was awarded the 2006 tournament, Sepp Blatter, president of FIFA made a personal pledge to ensure that the following tournament would be held in Africa, a continent which had never previously hosted the World Cup but which was central to FIFA's aim of growing the sport globally.
Four bids were submitted, by Egypt, Libya & Tunisia, Morocco and South Africa.  Libya and Tunisia withdrew their bid, and in 2004 South Africa beat Morocco and Egypt to be declared the 2010 host.
In order to host the tournament, South Africa has built five new stadiums, and upgraded four others.

Competing Nations
32 national teams competed in the 2010 World Cup.  South Africa, as hosts, were guaranteed a spot.  Each regional confederation ran a qualifying tournament to determine which of its member nations would attend the finals in South Africa, with the qualifiers being:
Africa: Algeria, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa (hosts)
Asia: Australia, Japan, North Korea, South Korea
Europe: Denmark, England, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland
North America: Honduras, Mexico, United States
South America: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay
Oceania: New Zealand

Outcome
The 2010 World Cup saw three European teams in the first three places: it was won by Spain, with the Netherlands as runner-ups and Germany in the third place. Uruguay was the South American team which had the best result, ending up in the fourth place.
Diego Forlán was proclaimed the best player of the competition; Thomas Müller, David Villa, Wesley Sneijder and Diego Forlan were tied as top-scorers, with 5 goals each. Müller was awarded the Golden Boot because of his three assists.

1066 and All That,https://www.conservapedia.com/1066_and_All_That,"1066 and All That, by W. C. Sellar and E. J. Yeatman, is a classic work of humor that pretends to be a history of England. It was first published in 1930 and has been so popular that it has stayed in print ever since. Its full title is:

1066 and All That: A Memorable History of England, comprising all the parts you can remember, including 103 Good Things, 5 Bad Kings and 2 Genuine Dates.
People who are studying English history appreciate its muddled, tongue-in-cheek humor. According to Sellar and Yeatman, for example, what they call the ""Magna Charter"" said

That no one was to be put to death, save for some reason—(except the Common People);
That everyone should be free—(except the Common People);
That everything should be of the same weight and measure throughout the Realm—(except the Common People)
and concludes that ""Magna Charter was therefore the chief cause of Democracy in England, and thus a Good Thing for everyone (except the Common People).""[1]
1066 is a reference to the year the Battle of Hastings was fought, a date that all English schoolchildren memorize, like 1776 in the United States; it is one of Sellar and Yeatman's ""2 Genuine Dates,""
the other being 55 B.C. when Julius Caesar led the first Roman invasion of Britain.
Its impact since 1930 has been enormous. It has been a successful stage show, and has also been serialised on radio; its title has passed into the language as a phrase in its own right. Sellar and Yeatman were aiming to produce a work far more complex than just a parody of history, however - they were mocking the simplistic and didactic manner in which English history was then taught to children. The title is drawn from the general observation that for all the emphasis on memorizing dates that made up so much of history teaching, few people remembered more than two: 1066 and 55 BC. (and the day and month of the Gunpowder Plot, ""though not, of course, the year"").[2]

1776,https://www.conservapedia.com/1776,"1776 was a musical based on America's struggle for independence. John Adams is a central character, and the play was written by Sherman Edwards, a songwriter and musician who had briefly taught high school history after his military service during World War II.
The stage musical was written in 1969 and adapted to film in 1972.
President Richard Nixon saw a production of the musical in 1970, and successfully persuaded producer Jack L. Warner, a friend of his, to remove the number ""Cool, Cool Considerate Men"" from the film version. Nixon disliked the song, which shows the conservatives of the 1770s as ""power-hungry wheedlers focused on maintaining wealth."" The negative was supposed to be destroyed as well, but it was secretly preserved by the editor.[1] Years later, the footage was restored and included in the ""director's cut"" for release on DVD.

Establishment
During the war with Prussia and Austria, the duke of brunswick issued his Brunswick Manifesto which threatened harm to the citizens of Paris, if the monarchy was harmed. This served as a catalyst to the anger boiling in Paris, and on 10/August/1789, the Palace of Tuileries was stormed, and the Swiss guard massacred. Soon after, in September, the counter-revolutionaries in the city prisons were all killed, in the September Massacre.[2]

The Department of Public Safety
The department was formed on April 6, 1793, with Maximillien Robespierre put at the head. It was tasked with dealing with the daily riots, the constant food shortages, and the threats of the right wing monarchists. This department was soon the de facto government. Under the rule of the department, the Declaration on the Rights of the Man and the Citizen. During this time, the Guillotine became known the national razor.[3]

End of the Republic
The Directory of France was overthrown in a coup d'état on 18/oct/1799. Napoleon Bonaparte was a conspirator in the coup. With the declaration of the Consul, and Bonaparte at the head, the republic in essence came to an end.

The Libyan War started as the Benghazi rebellion, a series of protests in extremist dominated eastern Libya on February 16, 2011 after the toppling of secular regimes in Tunisia and Egypt. The scale of violence contrasted markedly with the domestic uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt. The Islamist terror group, the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group with its elements of Ansar al-Shariah, the local branch of Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Al-Qaeda in North Africa), vowed to do everything in its power against the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi with assistance provided by Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and several NATO allies.[2][3][4] After being successful, the same group murdered the U.S. Ambassador and burnt down the U.S. Embassy killing all inside.

Libya before the 2011 uprising
 Satellite view is showing irrigated farming projects at Al Khufrah Oasis in south-east Libya. Part of the ""Great Man Made River Project"" ($33 billion), where water is drawn from vast underground aquifers. This water is transported about 800 km (500 mi) to the coastal cities of Libya by means of the world's largest underground network of pipes.
In 1951 Libya was officially the poorest country in the world,[5] but by the time of the 2011 uprising, Libyans' living standards were considered the highest in Africa. The GDP per Capita was more than double that of Egypt, and above that of Russia. All people had access to doctors, hospitals, clinics and medicines, completely free of charge; but more than the advances in housing, agricultural, industry, health care, education, was the advance in direct popular democracy.[6] Condoleezza Rice praised Libya for its ""excellent co-operation"" in the US-led war on terror.[7] As Wikileaks showed in the Clinton emails, Gaddafi was overthrown to prevent the adoption of gold backed currency.[8][9]
The living standards of Libyans improved significantly since the 1970s, ranking the country among the highest in Africa. Urbanization, developmental projects, and high oil revenues enabled the Gaddafi regime to elevate the people's living standards. The social and economic status of women and children has particularly improved under the secular ruler. Various subsidized or free services (health, education, housing, and basic foodstuffs) ensured basic necessities. The low percentage of people without access to safe water (3 percent), health services (0 percent) and sanitation (2 percent), and a relatively high life expectancy (70.2 years) in 1998 indicated improved living standards. Adequate health care and subsidized foodstuffs sharply reduced infant mortality, from 105 per 1,000 live births in 1970 to 20 per 1,000 live births in 1998. The Gaddafi regime also subsidizes education, which was government supported, co-educational and compulsory between the ages of 6 and 15. The expansion of educational facilities elevated the literacy rate (78.1 in 1998). There now are universities in Tripoli, Benghazi, Marsa el-Brega, Misurata, Sebha, and Tobruk.[10]
Nobel Peace Prize recipient Nelson Mandela warned of the machinations of outside influences in a speech recognizing Gaddafi and his leadership in Africa:



 “

 In a world where the strong may seek to impose upon the more vulnerable; and where particular nations or groups of nations may still seek to decide the fate of the planet - in such a world respect for multilateralism, moderation of public discourse and a patient search for compromise become even more imperative to save the world from debilitating conflict and enduring inequality. When we dismissed criticism of our friendship with yourself, My Brother Leader, and of the relationship between South Africa and Libya, it was precisely in defence of those values.[11]

 ”

 Benghazi shopping center.
By 2011 the Libyan people seemed to be thriving with Gaddafi as leader. A delegation of medical professionals from Russia, Ukraine and Belarus wrote in an appeal to ""Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin that after becoming acquainted with Libyan life, it was their view that in few nations did people live in such comfort"". Libya then was not a highly polarized society divided between extremes of wealth and poverty.
On February 24, 2011, no threat was seen to Libya's Seat on top U.N. Human Rights Body. A European Union draft resolution “strongly condemned” human rights violations sparked by opponents to the government, rather than condemning Gaddafi or the regime for committing them. [6]
The ""United Nations Development Program (UNDP) confirms that the country had excellent prospects for achieving United Nations development goals by 2015. NATO's war will have already dashed those hopes. A collapse like the one in Iraq now threatens the country. [7]

Outside assistance to Islamist rebels
Journalist David Wood reported, 



 “

 Eastern Libya has been described by U.S. diplomats as a breeding ground for Islamist extremism. In diplomatic cables released by Wikileaks, the region’s young men were said to have ""nothing to lose"" by resorting to violence. Sermons in the local mosques are ""laced with phraseology urging worshippers to support jihad,"" one diplomat reported.[12]

 ”


Wood added,



 “

 extremist elements make up only a portion of the resistance to Gaddafi and have been present in every popular uprising in the region stretching from the Iranian revolution to the Egyptian people’s overthrow of Hosni Mubarak.[13]

 ”

 Tripoli, 2009.
Abdel-Hakim al-Hasidi, the Libyan rebel leader, has said jihadists who fought against American troops in Iraq served on the front lines.[14][15]
An international coalition intervened in what many described as an ""illegal war""[16] led by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), whose own leaders have openly questioned what the value, purpose, and reason for existence of NATO is.[17][18][19]
It was reported on February 24, 2011, that an emergency meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) on Libya would take no action, or make no recommendation to the UN General Assembly, to remove Libya from its seat on the UN Human Rights Council, despite alleged human rights abuses.[20]  The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) then voted on March 17, 2011, to pass Security Council resolution 1973 proposed by France, along with its British and Lebanese partners, initiating the use of military force in Libya.  China, Russia, India and Brazil (the so-called BRIC nations) all abstained from the vote. The Obama administration called for Gaddafi to step aside, and has provided assistance to the insurgent tribes. US Congressional leaders were not consulted,[21] nor did the United States Congress ever authorize any use of force in Libya.
Military and intelligence experts in France, Britain, and the United States warned about uncertainties, but were overruled by political leaders. The result was a set of decisions focusing on short term considerations and gambling on the outcome. French, British, and US leaders did not fully coordinate, but according to Anthony Cordesman, it became clear,



 “

 they sought and got international cover from the UN by claiming a no fly zone could protect civilians when their real objective was to use force as a catalyst to drive Gaddafi out of power.

 ”


Sarkozy, Cameron, and Obama seem to have assumed that a largely unknown, divided, and fractured group of insurgents could win through sheer political momentum, and could then be turned into a successful government. Within the first month it was obvious a ""weak, divided, poorly led, and badly equipped and supplied set of rebel tribes can only hang on with the present level of air support"" that was provided.
The assault on Libya set off a frenzy of speculations about the real motive behind the war in the oil-rich country, with many analysts saying that under the guise of protecting civilians, as enshrined in the UNSC Resolution 1973, Washington and its Western allies are basically after the North African country's vast oil reserves.[22]
Stephen Lendman: Libya assault planned months ahead; See interview: in Youtube.

Petrodollars and oil
According to a Russian article titled Bombing of Libya - Punishment for Qaddafi for His Attempt to Refuse US Dollar, Gaddafi initiated a movement to refuse the dollar and the Euro as payment for Libya's oil, and called on Arab and African nations to use a new currency, the gold dinar. Gaddafi proposed establishing a united African continent, with its 200 million people using this single currency.  The initiative was viewed negatively in the United States and the European Union, with French president Nicolas Sarkozy calling Libya a threat to the financial security of mankind. But Gaddafi continued his push for the creation of a united Africa. As early September 9, 1999, the first steps towards the formation of the African Union were taken by the Heads of State of the Organisation of African Unity.[23]
In the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008 forcing the United States into recession, both China and Russia called for the dollar's role in the global financial system to be diluted. Both China and the USSR abstained from UNSCR 1973.
Bloomberg News reported in September 2010 that China and Russia planned to start trading in each other's currency as the world's second-biggest energy consumer and the largest energy supplier seek to diminish the dollar's role in global trade.  Bhanu Baweja commented 



 “

 Given the risk to the dollar and U.S. assets from their fiscal position they want to reduce their dependence on the dollar as an invoicing currency....It makes sense for two large economies to exclude a third, overly dominant economy from their trading equation.[24]

 ”


The African Union
An observer spelled out one of Gaddafi's motivations for proposing an African Union:



 “

 It began in 1992, when 45 African nations established RASCOM (Regional African Satellite Communication Organization) so that Africa would have its own satellite and slash communication costs in the continent. This was a time when phone calls to and from Africa were the most expensive in the world because of the annual US$500 million fee pocketed by Europe for the use of its satellites like Intelsat for phone conversations, including those within the same country.
An African satellite only cost a one-time payment of $400 million and the continent no longer had to pay a $500 million annual lease. Which banker wouldn't finance such a project? But the problem remained – how can slaves, seeking to free themselves from their master’s exploitation ask the master’s help to achieve that freedom? Not surprisingly, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the USA, Europe only made vague promises for 14 years. Gaddafi put an end to these futile pleas to the western ‘benefactors’ with their exorbitant interest rates. The Libyan guide put $300 million on the table; the African Development Bank added $50 million more and the West African Development Bank a further $27 million – and that’s how Africa got its first communications satellite on 26 December 2007.[25]


 ”


Libyan Central Bank
In an article posted on the Market Oracle, Eric Encina observed:



 “

 One seldom mentioned fact by western politicians and media pundits: the Central Bank of Libya is 100% State Owned.... Currently, the Libyan government creates its own money, the Libyan Dinar, through the facilities of its own central bank. Few can argue that Libya is a sovereign nation with its own great resources, able to sustain its own economic destiny. One major problem for globalist banking cartels is that in order to do business with Libya, they must go through the Libyan Central Bank and its national currency, a place where they have absolutely zero dominion or power-broking ability. Hence, taking down the Central Bank of Libya (CBL) may not appear in the speeches of Obama, Cameron and Sarkozy but this is certainly at the top of the globalist agenda for absorbing Libya into its hive of compliant nations.[26]

 ”


Ellen Brown adds,



 “

 Libya not only has oil. According to the IMF, its central bank has nearly 144 tons of gold in its vaults. With that sort of asset base, who needs the BIS (Bank of International Settlements), the IMF and their rules.[27]

 ”


Gaddafi's proposal to introduce a gold dinar for Africa contravenes IMF rules and is designed to bypass them.

U.S. State Dept Report on Religious freedom (2009)
The U.S. State Department's International Religious Freedom Report for 2009 said this of religious freedom's under Gaddafi's regime:[28]

a basis for some degree of religious freedom is provided in the Great Green Charter on Human Rights of the Jamahiriya Era, and the Government generally respects the right to observe one's religion freely in practice. The Government tolerates most minority religions but strongly opposes militant forms of Islam, which it views as a security threat... The World Islamic Call Society (WICS) is the official conduit for the state-approved form of Islam....WICS serves as the religious arm of Qadhafi's foreign policy... There were no reports of forced religious conversion...prominent representatives from the Government and society made new efforts to promote religious coexistence and harmony. ...minority religious communities achieved several symbolic milestones within the context of the country's increasing openness to the international community. ...There were no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious affiliation, belief, or practice.
In 2001 Gaddafi's Islamic Call Society provided the Anglican Church of Christ the King with a church building on the downtown square in Tripoli.[29]

Italian Friendship treaty
""We signed a friendship treaty with Libya, that includes a non-aggression clause, but when the counterpart no longer exists — in this case the Libyan state — the treaty cannot be applied”, said Italy’s foreign minister, Franco Frattini on February 26, 2011, ten days after the uprising began.  



 “

 Italy’s treaty with Libya, signed by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in August 2008, calls on Italy to pay Libya $5 billion over 20 years in reparations for its colonial past there. In return, Libya pledged to help block the flow of illegal immigrants to Italy and grant favorable treatment for Italian companies seeking to do business in Libya.[30]

 ”


French aid to rebels
A report from Congressman Dennis Kucinich corroborated the claim of Franco Bechis[31] in Italy that ""plans to spark the Benghazi rebellion were initiated by French intelligence services in November 2010.""[32]
On March 10, 2011, France became the first and only country to recognize the Libyan Transitional National Council “as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people.”[33] ""France recognizes states, not parties"", said a senior official on March 9. After a meeting arranged by Bernard-Henri Lévy the next morning, on March 10, two representatives of the Libyan opposition emerged from President Sarkozys office at the Elysée Palace to announce that ""France recognizes the Libyan Transitional National Council as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people"".[34][35]
On March 19, two days after passage of UN Security Council Resolution 1973,[36] French President Nicolas Sarkozy convened an emergency meeting of allied and Arab leaders in Paris which endorsed the immediate deployment of military aircraft to attack Gaddafi forces defending Benghazi and establish a no-fly zone. Before the end of the meeting, French fighter planes were attacking armored vehicles and tanks outside Benghazi. Some participants at the Paris meeting were critical of the French government, both for insisting on convening the meeting before agreeing to endorse air strikes, and then for launching air strikes before the meeting was over.[37] French officials claim that meeting participants were informed of the operation beforehand.  The strikes had clearly been planned and coordinated with the United States and some other NATO forces.[38]
National Public Radio (NPR) reported Sarkozy enjoyed a ""burst of public support""[39] while the London Guardian wrote Sarkozy's actions may save him from ""electoral humiliation.""[40] Several analysts speculate Sarkozy used the crisis to propel France into a  Superpower role, usurping the global leadership of the United States abrogated by President Obama.[41] Columnist Jim Hoagland of the Washington Post observes, 



 “

 France is a country that has a past being involved in world affairs, wanting to count in world affairs, and being willing to pay its way for defense forces and to use those forces abroad. So, France plays a natural role in that. At a time when governments are slashing defense spending and reducing troops, France still wants to occupy an important role in world affairs....the reason you're seeing France taking on such a much larger role is that other countries, including the United States, are not willing to do it anymore. And Sarkozy is trying to fill that vacuum.[42]

 ”


Sarkozy's approval rating stood at 30% prior to the intervention.

Legality of French actions
On May 29 two French lawyers, Roland Dumas and Jacques Vergès, announced plans to initiate legal proceedings against President Nicolas Sarkozy for crimes against humanity over the NATO led campaign in Libya. Dumas (who also served as a foreign minister under President François Mitterrand) said that the NATO mission, which was meant to protect civilians, is in fact killing them.[43] On July 4 a French lawyer, Marcel Ceccaldi, called for investigation of the International Criminal Court on NATO ""war crimes"". [8]

Security Council Res. 1973 and NATO
UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1973 of March 17, 2011 followed on the heels of Gaddafi's public announcement on March 2 he may throw western oil companies out of Libya, and his invitation on March 14 to Chinese, Russian, and Indian firms to produce Libyan oil in their place.[44] China, Russia, India and Brazil all abstained on UNSC Resolution 1973.
Despite France taking the lead role in the intervention, the Congressional Research Service reports, ""Only the United States and NATO possess the command and control capabilities necessary for coalition operations enforcing the no-fly zone over Libya."" France only recently rejoined the NATO alliance, in 2008, after a 40-year absence. The Congressional Research Service, which analyzes information and prepares reports for members of Congress, also states,



 “

 In spite of statements underscoring NATO unity on steps announced to date, the initial planning and operational phases were also marked by significant levels of discord within Europe and NATO on the aims and future direction of the mission. A key point of contention was reportedly the amount of flexibility that NATO forces would be granted to protect civilians and civilian areas, as called for in paragraph 4 of UNSCR 1973. Reports indicate that French officials insisted on maintaining the ability to strike ground forces that threatened civilian areas, while their Turkish counterparts vocally opposed any targeting of ground forces. Adding to the strain within NATO, NATO ally Germany abstained from UNSCR 1973 and, opposed to any potential combat operation, on March 23, withdrew its naval assets in the Mediterranean from NATO command. Throughout the first week of operations, other European allies contributing to the mission, including Italy and Norway, expressed increasing frustration with the lack of agreement within NATO, with Norway refusing to deploy its fighter jets unless under they were under NATO command and control.[45]

 ”


Of NATO's 28 members, 14 are said to be ""actively participating,"" but only 6 provided military support. By June Norway announced its intention to quit the coalition[46] and French and British leaders expressed concerns over being able to meet the costs of a war they dragged the United States into.[47] Of the 22-country Arab League, whose appeal prompted the United Nations to vote on intervention, only Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are involved. Of the 192 members of the UN General Assembly, who all have a legal ""responsibility to protect"" civilians attacked by their own governments, only Sweden has responded.[48] After the authorization and commitment of NATO and U.S. forces, Secretary Gates announced,



 “

 The mightiest military alliance in history is only 11 weeks into an operation against a poorly armed regime in a sparsely populated country, yet many allies are beginning to run short of munitions, requiring the U.S., once more, to make up the difference.

 ”


and warned



 “

 The blunt reality is that there will be dwindling appetite and patience in the U.S. Congress—and in the American body politic writ large—to expend increasingly precious funds on behalf of nations that are apparently unwilling to devote the necessary resources or make the necessary changes to be serious and capable partners in their own defense.[49]

Exceeding UN mandate
Resolution 1973 authorized strict limitations, according to international law, on NATO as the organization with  responsibility for the implementation of the resolution. Particularly, it provides only for a naval blockade enforcing the arms embargo, and enforcement of a no-fly zone. On March 29, 2011, Russian envoy Dmitry Rogozin commented after a meeting with NATO officials in Brussels, Belgium, that Russia expressed deep concern over the interpretation of the Security Council's resolution, as some countries have effectively turned it into an approval for ground operations.



 “

 Moscow has many questions about how the UN Security Council’s resolution is being carried out...First of all, there are reports that civilians have been killed in the air strikes. This is odd if you consider the message of the resolution, which says that the foreign forces’ actions should protect civilians. So it’s hard to comprehend how you can protect civilians by killing them....we demanded that the UN Security Council be fully informed about the actions of the alliance in Libya at all times...  We have reports of air strikes against convoys far from the front line. This is a far cry from the UN Security Council resolution.[50]

 ”


NATO planes and ships have been striking cities and military installations in Libya since mid-March, 2011. Allied military officials have spoken in recent weeks of the need for escalation to help protect Libyan civilians and have called for Gaddafi to step down. Libyan officials have said that NATO is picking sides in a civil war and complained that strikes on Gaddafi's Tripoli compound are attempts to assassinate the leader of a sovereign country. NATO launched its largest airstrike against Moammar Gaddafi's regime on May 24, 2011, with at least 15 massive explosions rocking the Libyan capital. [9]


On May 15, two months into the NATO bombing campaign against loyal Gaddafi’s forces, Britain’s top military commander said that the Libyan leader could remain “clinging to power” unless NATO broadened its bombing targets to include the country’s infrastructure.[51]


The French and the British described plans for a wargames exercise for an attack on Libya last November, in the end they used those military assets that had been mobilized for the real thing 3 months ago. We know that NATO doesn't just go and bomb a country over night, these things are planned far in advance, and in this case there is conclusive evidence that there have been plans for this for many many years.[52]
On Jun 18, Prime minister of Libya Al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi accused NATO of a ""new level of aggression"" over the past 72 hours in which he said the military alliance intentionally targeted civilian buildings, including a hotel and a university. ""It has become clear to us that NATO has moved on to deliberately hitting civilian buildings. ... This is a crime against humanity,"" he told reporters in the capital. Libya's Health Ministry released new casualty figures that put the number of civilians killed in NATO air strikes through to June 7 at 856.[53]

Italy called for a suspension of hostilities in Libya on June 22 in the latest sign of dissent within NATO as the civilian death toll mounts and Muammar Gaddafi shows no signs of quitting power. [10]

African response to outside intervention
NATO's Libyan intervention has proven fractious in black Africa; in March Nigeria's Foreign Minister Odein Ajumogobia commented, ""The contradictions between principle and national interest ... have enabled the international community to impose a no-fly zone over Libya ostensibly to protect innocent civilians from slaughter, but to watch seemingly helplessly (in Ivory Coast) as ...men, women and children are slaughtered in equally, even if less egregious, violence.""[54]
Amr Moussa, the outgoing head of the Arab League and a front runner to become president of a democratic Egypt, has voiced reservations about NATO's bombing campaign in Libya, calling for a ceasefire and talks on a political settlement while Muammar Gaddafi remains in power. [11]
The Arab League, which in March asked the United Nations Security Council to impose a no-fly zone over Libya to protect civilians, condemned the loss of life in bombing incidents.
""When the Arab League agreed on the idea of having a no-fly zone over Libya it was to protect civilians but when civilians get killed this has to be condemned with the harshest of statements,"" said Deputy Secretary-General Ahmed Ben Helli.
The Libyan leader says the Western-led military campaign is an act of colonial aggression designed to steal Libya's oil. [12]

United States intervention
Frozen assets
President Obama moved swiftly to support French plans to frustrate Gaddafi's proposal for an African Union with his unilateral declaration of a national emergency in order to freeze all of the Bank of Libya's $30 billion of funds to which America had access. This was reported in the U.S. press as a freeze of the funds of ""Colonel Qaddafi, his children and family, and senior members of the Libyan government.[55]  The second section of Obama’s decree explicitly targeted ""All property and interests… of the Government of Libya, its agencies, instrumentalities, and controlled entities, and the Central Bank of Libya.[56] The consequences of the $30-billion freeze for Africa, as well as for Libya, have been spelled out by an African observer:

 Treaty of Tripoli, Libya was one of the first nations to recognize the US in 1796.


 “

 The US$30 billion frozen by Mr Obama belong to the Libyan Central Bank and had been earmarked as the Libyan contribution to three key projects which would add the finishing touches to the African federation – the African Investment Bank in Syrte, Libya, the establishment in 2011 of the African Monetary Fund to be based in Yaounde with a US$42 billion capital fund and the Abuja-based African Central Bank in Nigeria which when it starts printing African money will ring the death knell for the CFA franc through which Paris has been able to maintain its hold on some African countries for the last fifty years. It is easy to understand the French wrath against Gaddafi.

 ”


No-fly zone
On March 21, 2011, President Obama publicly announced U.S. military forces commenced no fly-zone operations in Libya two days earlier, on March 19, ""to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe"" and cited UN Resolutions as giving him the authority to do so. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates warned establishment of a no-fly zone meant attacking Libaya.[57] Officials as National Security Advisor Tom Donilon and Deputy National Security Advisor Denis McDonough also opposed to attacking Libya; but Hillary Clinton, tossing her ""smart power"" doctrine to the wind,  ""won the bureaucratic battle to use Department of Defense resources to achieve what's essentially the State Department's objective... and Obama let it happen"".[58] The Charter of the United Nations, in Article 2(4), prohibits the “threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence” of a member state, and many observers have wondered whether the establishment of a no-fly zone would constitute a violation of this prohibition. The Congressional Research Services advised that a no-fly zone imposed against a state that has not carried out an attack on its neighbors may consider the imposition of a no-fly zone an “armed attack.” CRS warned that even if no-fly zone operations in a given state do not constitute an “armed attack"",



 “

 that state, and other members of the international community, might consider them a violation of the prohibition of the “threat or use of force,” as well as of the customary duty of non-intervention in the affairs of other sovereign states.

 ”


NATO's Supreme Allied Commander James Stavridis told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee days before President Obama publicly admitted to intervention that U.S. intelligence knew of al Qaeda and Hezbollah elements among the Libyan insurgents.[59]

Organizing the Libyan Islamic Fighters Group
 Ostensibly Obama's justification for the Libyan War was ""to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe"". Within two years of Obama's action, trafficking in Black African slaves became an important part of the economy of the new Libya Obama created.
A document published by the U.S. West Point Military Academy's Combating Terrorism Center  reveals that jihadi rebels, unhappy with the Gaddafi regime, exited Libya to join the Islamic insurgency in Iraq in numbers greater than any other country. The captured Sinjar documents[60] include background information on foreign jihadists who migrated to Iraq to kill American soldiers,[61] many of those jihadi rebels coming from among the very people Obama pledged to protect in the name of ""humanitarianism"". David Wood wrote: ""Almost one in five foreign fighters arriving in Iraq came from eastern Libya, from the towns of Surt, Misurata and Darnah. On a per capita basis, that’s more than twice as many than came from any other Arabic-speaking country, amounting to what the counter terrorism center called a Libyan 'surge' of young men eager to kill Americans."" The report notes 82% of Libyan jihadi rebels volunteered as suicide bombers, well above the 56% of all foreign insurgents in Iraq.
The report reminded that Benghazi has long been associated with Islamic militancy in Libya, in particular for an uprising by Islamist organizations in the mid‐1990s. One group—the Libyan Fighting Group (jamaʹah al‐libiyah al‐muqatilah)—claimed to have Afghan veterans in its ranks. The Libyan uprisings became extraordinarily violent. The West Point study noted Gaddafi had taken measures to mitigate the threat from rebel jihadi groups, and amnestied some Muslim Brotherhood activists in the hope that they would moderate the views of more violent Islamist activists.
The Combating Terrorism Center document concludes,



 “

 The Syrian [ Assad regime] and Libyan [Gaddafi] governments share the United States’ concerns about violent salafi‐jihadi ideology and the violence perpetrated by its adherents. These governments [Syria, Gaddafi, and the US] like others in the Middle East, fear violence inside their borders and would much rather radical elements go to Iraq rather than cause unrest at home. U.S. and Coalition efforts to stem the flow of fighters into Iraq will be enhanced if they address the entire logistical chain that supports the movement of these individuals—beginning in their home countries – rather than just their Syrian entry points.

 ”


This set off a fierce debate in the Obama administration over the wisdom of arming terrorists.[62] It is now known sometime prior to March 31, 2011,[63] Obama signed a Presidential Finding authorizing support for what came to be known as Libyan Islamic Fighting Group which included elements of al Qaeda.[64] Direct arms support would violate the arms embargo imposed by UN Security Council Resolution 1970 on February 26, 2011.[64]
Public opinion initially was divided on support for President Obama's actions, within 30 days however, opposition rose 15%[65] as the reality of the intervention set in.

Amb. Stevens appointed US liaison to jihadis
Giving in to Hillary's pressure, on Friday March 8, 2011, President Obama told reporters he would appoint an official to maintain contact with the ""Libyan opposition"". The number two official at the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli, Christopher Stevens[66]  was tasked with helping to coordinate assistance to the ""rebels"", whose top military commander, Abdelhakim Belhadj, was the leader of the Al Qaeda affiliate, the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG).[67] Hillary Clinton attended a meeting in Paris with Stevens and representatives of the ""Libyan opposition"", as did U.S. Ambassador Gene Cretz, who has also had contacts with the ""opposition"". Clinton discussed what she persuaded the Obama administration to do to help the jihadis, and that they would do more than just provide humanitarian aid.

Bypassing Congress
Under the War Powers Act of 1973 the U.S President has limited authority to use military force without Congressional authorization when there is an imminent national security threat.
The War Powers Act specifically states that the President's power to introduce forces into hostilities or imminent hostilities can only be exercised pursuant to (1) a declaration of war; (2) specific statutory authorization; or (3) a national emergency created by an attack on the United States or its forces. The War Powers Act requires the President in every possible instance to consult with Congress before introducing American Armed Forces into hostilities or imminent hostilities unless there has been a declaration of war or other specific Congressional authorization. 
None of these prerequisites have been met, however, and President Obama made clear that he ordered the use of force for other reasons.  Members of Congress of both parties have expressed concern the President may have violated the law in doing so.[68]
The Washington Post reported on May 20, 2011 President Obama missed the legal deadline set in the 1973 law that required him to obtain Congressional approval for U.S. military operations in Libya. Under the Nixon-era War Powers Resolution, the president must obtain Congressional authorization of military action within 60 days, or else begin withdrawing forces.[69] Sen. Richard Lugar of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations warned President Obama, 




 “

 U.S. military operations in Libya have assumed a different character than you suggested when you announced the decision to initiate them.  In your March 21 letter to the Congress, you indicated that these operations would be limited in their nature, duration, and scope, and focused on protecting civilians and civilian populated areas from attack.  Two months into these operations, your Administration is unable to specify what limits will apply to the duration of the operations, and the coalition in which we are participating appears to have expanded its objectives to weakening the Gaddafi regime’s hold on power through strikes on leadership targets and, potentially, infrastructure targets.[70][71]

 ”


The evidence is President Obama's war in Libya is illegal and unconstitutional. Columnist George Will laid out the case in, “Is Obama Above the Law?” The war is a violation of the War Powers Act, which says the president can go to war without Congressional approval only if there is an imminent threat to the U.S. and there is a 60-day deadline for the withdrawal of forces. [13]
The law states that “The constitutional powers of the President as Commander-in-Chief to introduce United States Armed Forces into hostilities, or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances, are exercised only pursuant to
(1) a declaration of war,
(2) specific statutory authorization, or
(3) a national emergency created by attack upon the United States , its territories or possessions, or its armed forces.”
Since there was no declaration of war or statutory authorization for the Libya action, there has to be a national emergency created by an attack on the U.S. There was none in the Libya case.[72] A bipartisan group of legislators have begun action against what they perceive to be President Obama's unconstitutional misuse of power.[73]
According to Rep. Dennis Kucinich:

 It is unconstitutional, violating Article 1, Section 8 of the US Constitution which gives the power of declaring war to the Congress.
 It is illegal, as the War Powers Resolution was exploited out of context in order to declare war.
 American public opinion is against it, as 6 Americans out of 10 oppose the war.
 It distracts the President from more immediate concerns, such as the dire state of the economy.
 It costs funds that should be used for other purposes.
 Although the war was declared by Britain and France, America is paying more than other NATO allies.
 Civilians are being killed by the same powers that are supposed to protect them.
 The U.N. Resolution that authorized limited military action did not allow for regime change
 Public support of the war is eroding even in other allied countries.
 The situation is a stalemate that ought to be solved by political, not military means.
See more at: 10 Reasons to Oppose the War in Libya.
Kucinich's bill to oppose intervention in Libya was supported by 87 conservative House Republicans.
Rep. Ron Paul said ""Why did the US intervene in a civil war in a country that has neither attacked us nor poses a threat? We are told this was another humanitarian intervention, like Clinton’s 1999 war against Serbia. But as civilian victims of the US-led coalition bombing continue to add up, it is getting difficult to determine whether the problem we are creating on the ground is worse than the one we were trying to solve."" [14]
""Michael Scheuer, former head of the CIA’s Bin Laden unit, explained in a recent article that there is plausible reason to believe the rebels are current or former Islamist mujahedin, eager to engage in jihad. Indeed, Gaddafi has fought against Libyan Islamists for years and is seen by them as a bitter enemy. Astoundingly, it may well be that we are assisting al Qaeda in this new war! Ibidem""

Role of China
In the first decade of the Twenty-first century China quietly has overtaken the United States to become Africa's largest trading partner, particularly in oil, which accounts for 73 percent of all African exports.  According to the Chinese government's first white paper on its economic and trade cooperation with Africa, China's trade with Africa has soared to $114.81 billion in the first 11 months of 2010. China uses about 8 million barrels per day (bpd), a demand that is projected to rise to 11.3 million bpd by 2015 and now receives 28 percent of its oil imports from Africa. China's top oil suppliers are Saudi Arabia, Iran, Angola, Russia, Oman and Sudan. Saudi Arabia is China's top oil supplier (1.1 million bpd.) China is also buying oil from Chad, Gabon and Nigeria as well. China's top African oil suppliers are Angola, Sudan and Nigeria. The International Monetary Fund reports, oil now accounts for 99 percent of Sudanese exports, with China absorbing for 65 percent of them. Energy is Angola's sole export hard currency earner, with China now accounting for 35 percent of Angolan exports.[74]

Competition for resources
After hostilities began China evacuated over 36,000 of its energy and construction workers and shut down operations of Chinese companies with over $18.8 billion of Chinese investments in Libya.[75] China alone is expected to invest on a scale of $50 billion a year in Libya and Africa by 2015, a figure - funded by America's trade deficit with China - which the Western powers and NATO cannot match.[76] China, Libya's largest Asian oil customer, called for an immediate ceasefire.
Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former Assistant Secretary of US Treasury in the Reagan administration observed the joint French, British, and US coalition's objective is



 “

 to eliminate China from the Mediterranean. China has extensive energy investments and construction investments in Libya. They are looking to Africa as a future energy source. The US is countering this by organizing the United States African Command (USAC), which Qaddafi refused to join. So that's the second reason for the Americans to want Qaddafi out.

 ”


Roberts observes 



 “

  the protests in Libya are different from the ones in Egypt or Yemen or Bahrain or Tunisia and the difference is that this is an armed rebellion...these protests originated in the eastern part of Libya where the oil is - they did not originate in the capital city. And we have heard from the beginning credible reports that the CIA is involved in the protests, and there have been a large number of press reports that the CIA has sent back to Libya its Libyan asset[77] to head up the Libyan rebellion... China has 50 major investment projects in eastern Libya.[78]

 ”


Whatever Washington's ulterior motives, there is no doubt that NATO's military operations in Libya are harming China's fiscal interests. According to information from China's Ministry of Trade, by March, when the military operation began, there were 75 major Chinese companies operating in Libya, and they had concluded $18 billion in contracts. Because of the NATO operations in Libya, the Chinese companies are expecting gigantic losses.[79]

Formation of the National Transitional Council
The National Transitional Council of the Libyan Republic announced its official establishment in early March 2011 in the city of Benghazi. The stated goal was to the overthrow of Mu’ammar Gaddafi.[80] It has been recognized by France, Qatar, Italy, Kuwait, Maldives and Gambia. They have proceeded to form a transitional government for the post-Gaddafi era. Before forming a government, they robbed about $505 million from the Central Bank of Libya in Benghazi.

 “

 The top leaders of the “revolutionary” masses in Benghazi are two recent defectors of what the Left dubs Gaddafi’s “murderous regime”, Mustafa Abdul Jalil a former Justice minister (who prosecuted dissenters up to the day before the armed uprising), Mahmoud Jebril a top Gaddafite neo-liberal prominent in inviting multi-nationals to take over the oil fields (FT, March 23, 2011, p. 7) and Ali Aziz al-Eisawa, Gaddafi’s former ambassador to India who jumped ship when it looked like the uprising would succeed. These self-appointed leaders of the “rebels” are staunch backers of Euro-US military intervention just as they previously were long-term backers of Gaddafi’s dictatorship and promoters of MNC takeovers of oil and gas fields. The heads of the “rebels” military council is Omar Hariri and General Abdul Fattah Younis former head of the Ministry of Interior, both with long histories (since 1969) of repressing any democratic movements.[81]

 ”


Jihadi Death Squads
Insurgent jihadis created a wanted list and placed suspects under round-the-clock surveillance. Secret militia units raid houses without court warrants and often interrogate suspects for hours. Those released have to sign a document stating their loyalty to the revolution. As many as 30 civilians are being held at various jihadi rebel military bases around Benghazi without due process of law, said human rights activists, judges and prosecutors. In recent weeks, at least seven former members of the internal security police have turned up dead, their bodies riddled with bullets. Although it is not known who killed them, many suspect that they died at the hands of jihadi rebel-affiliated death squads. [15]
On May, 26, the deputy leader of Libya's rebel administration said it could take up to two years to organize elections, backtracking on promises of a six-month transition to democracy. [16]
Libyan rebels have also been reported to have committed violence against African migrant workers.[82][83] Similar reports have also emerged of violence against black Libyan.[84]

Misuse of outside humanitarian assistance
In May, 2011, NATO and Arab countries agreed in Rome to set up a fund to manage donations to help areas controlled by the jihadi rebels; they announced a financial mechanism to assist the opposition in Libya. This would include a partial unfreezing of Libyan assets in banks that would go into a temporary fund managed by the U.N. Sanctions Committee. And it would be intended to help the jihadi rebels with their immediate needs to cover food, medicine and hospital costs;[85] The insurgents would gain access to a special $3 billion (£1.8 billion) trust fund established by its Western backers to finance the breakaway regions fighting against Gaddafi on the outskirts of Benghazi. Modern urbanization and equipments may be clearly seen there.

 Tripoli, NATO bombing.
Outside intervention escalates the conflict
UN Security Council Resolution 1973, passed in March 2011, does not authorise participating members to support the anti-Gaddafi tribes, to defend armed groups, or to oust Gaddafi. Nor does it authorise a ground invasion or military occupation. Strategic analyst Anthony Cordesman notes the similarities between Libya and Iraq and the loose uncoordinated coalitions ""failure to plan for the decisive and lasting use of force, failure to plan for the civil side of military operations and to support stability operations, and focus on short term goals without a realistic plan for a successful strategic and post-conflict  outcome."" Cordesman notes,



 “

 the lives and futures of some 6.6 million Libyans are at stake. The Franco-Anglo-American gamble now seems far too likely to fail at their expense. Moreover, it seems likely to  drag the other nations that support the operation into their failure -- along with part of the reputation of NATO and credibility of the UN.... gambling on Qaddafi caving in has created a far more serious humanitarian crisis for the Libyan people than would ever have occurred if the Coalition had acted decisively from the start ...The humanitarian cost of humanitarian restraint is all too clear: Hundreds of Libyan and foreign workers have been killed...hundreds of thousands lack jobs, security, and safe conditions of life....an enduring war of attrition will turn a minor humanitarian crisis into a major one ...This kind of operation cannot be “surgical’ – if “surgical” now means minimizing bloodshed regardless of whether the patient dies. Hard, and sometimes brutal, choices need to be made between limited civilian casualties and collateral damage during the decisive use of force and an open-ended war of attrition that will produce far higher cumulative civilian casualties and collateral damage.[86]

 ”


Cordesman notes mission creep and boots on the ground ultimately lead to nation building:



 “

 France, Britain, and the US now have a special obligation to both finish what they started in military terms, and deal with the aftermath. A post-conflict Libya will need extensive help in building a workable political  system, in rebuilding the capability to govern, in both rebuilding the existing economy and correcting for decades of Qaddafi’s reckless and constantly shifting eccentricities.

 ”


On April 19, 2011, one month after Sarkozy, Cameron, and Obama asked the UN Security Council for authorization for a limited use of force, the UK Guardian reported,



 “

 Britain is now publicly doing what it expressly said it would not do when the no-fly intervention began: putting boots on the ground in Libya. France is taking similar action. Given that the rebel tribes have convincingly demonstrated their inability to win on their own, given the sizable negatives for David Cameron and Nicolas Sarkozy of an open-ended, inconclusive conflict, and given Barack Obama's flat refusal to do any more, the question now is: how many more British and French boots will follow, sooner or later, in the advisers' fateful footsteps?....By encouraging and assisting rebel resistance, as George Bush Snr did with the Shias of southern Iraq in 1991, Britain and France risk worsening the plight of the Libyan civilians they are primarily pledged to defend. The UN and concerned aid agencies all agree the humanitarian situation is growing steadily worse, the longer the conflict continues. .[48]

 ”


Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, in particular, has been scathing about Western intervention in Libya, comparing the Resolution 1973 to “a medieval call to the crusades” and saying “the so-called civilized community, with all its might, pounces on a small country, and ruins infrastructure that has been built over generations.” Mr. Putin returned to the subject of Libya repeatedly, despite acknowledging that foreign policy decisions were not within his portfolio as prime minister. [17]
By August the New York Times reported Christian churches were openly praying to protect Gaddafi as NATO bombs fell.[87]

Manufacturing Consent
""On how the western media makes the case for war. Our consent has been manufactured by the criminalization of Gaddafi and his government, and the Libyan people cannot believe it when I tell them what is said about him in the west. And if only you could see how they live, they are far more free than us in England in many ways, this does not fit in with the oppressive image of Gaddafi portrayed in the west.
So for example, I have had Libyans coming up to me asking me about a report in the popular French newspaper Le Figaro that came out about 3 days ago saying 10,000 people have been killed in Tripoli over the past 3 months by government forces. They are astonished, because this is complete and utter lies. "" Letter from Libya to a close friend.

Gaddafi's murder and aftermath
 Architects of the humanitarian catastrophe in Libya - Samantha Power (top) Susan Rice (left) and Hillary Clinton (right). President Obama initially billed US intervention ""to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe,"" however after Gaddafi's murder the Black-African slave trade re-emerged in open slave markets in Libya. NATO was used to give cover for the Obama administration's direct involvement.
Libyan rebel fighting groups with support from NATO airstrikes, overtook the capital of Tripoli and toppled the government of Libya causing Gaddafi to flee into hiding.  This victory finally peaked the interests of the liberal media, who remained silent, even as the President violated the War Powers Act. 
October 2011, the last enclave of government/tribal resistance fell in Gaddafi's hometown of Sirte. Ghaddafi was captured and brutally and sadistically murdered.[88] The jihadis were immediately recognized by the U.S. and the U.N. as the legitimate government. It remains to be seen how much of the billions of dollars held in foreign banks by the former regime will be released to the new government. It will be a year or longer before Libya can resume exporting oil at its pre-war capacity. 
The situation in a post-Gaddafi Libya is uncertain. Fears that the nation will be end up an Islamic state were proven true when Mustafa Abdul-Jalil, chairman of the National Transitional Council, announced in late October that Sharia will be the source for all legislation in Libya and that all laws conflicting with Sharia are null and void.[89] Abdel Rahim al-Kib, the country's interim prime minister, echoed Jalil's words a couple of days later.[90] Around the same time these statements were made an Al Qaeda flag was flown above the Benghazi courthouse, and reports were surfacing that the Libyan jihadis imposed Sharia law in some parts of the country even earlier.[89]
U.S. intelligence says as many as 20,000 advanced Russian surface-to-air missiles are missing and could end up in terror groups' arsenals.[91] Already some of those missiles reached the hands of Hamas in the Gaza Strip.[92] Al Qaeda is very active in the region and the conflict. No one is sure how to rid the country of this terrorist element.

Ambassador Stevens murdered
For a more detailed treatment, see Benghazi Attack.
A March 29, 2011 article in the Washington Post included these paragraphs:



 “

 ""It’s almost a certitude that at least part” of the Libyan opposition includes members of al-Qaeda, said Bruce Riedel, a former senior CIA analyst and adviser to President Obama. Riedel said that anti-Gaddafi elements in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi have had “very close associations with al-Qaeda” dating back years....I would hope that we now have a good sense of the opposition in Libya and can say that this is 2 percent, not 20 percent,” Riedel said. “If we don’t, then we are running the risk of helping to bring to power a regime that could be very dangerous.[93]

 ”


With several U.S.embassies besieged on the anniversary of the September 11 attacks, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney declared authorities had no reason to believe the attack on the sovereign territory of the United States consulate in Benghazi less than two months before the 2012 Presidential election, was a terrorist attack. Ambassador Christopher Stevens was brutally and hideously murdered,[94]  as were several other Americans. Stevens was appointed by Obama as the chief liaison to give money and aid for Stevens own killers.



 “

 The unrest that we’ve seen around the region has been in reaction to a video that Muslims, many Muslims, find offensive,

 ”


became the official White House line. President Obama went on the Comedy Channel to say the deaths of Americans was ""not optimal"".[95] When pressed by reporters, who pointed out evidence that the violence in Benghazi was a terrorist attack, Press Secretary Carney argued “the unrest around the region has been in response to this video.”
On September 16, 2012 Ambassador Susan Rice showed up on all five major Sunday morning talk shows to push the administration's spin linking the Benghazi murders and a satirical video. Rice told longtime Democratic partisan George Stephanopoulos of ABC's This Week, the attack was “a spontaneous – not a premeditated – response to what had transpired in Cairo” – referring to a demonstration in which a mob breached the embassy compound wall and tore down an American flag. Rice repeated the false claims throughout her morning talk-show appearances on all networks.[96]
Around a week after the attack Obama finally ordered an investigation. The leading suspected jihadis in the murders and terrorist attack were the local Benghazi branch of Ansar al-Shariah, known to have ties to al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM).[97] A commander of the terrorist group boasted jovially over drinks with reporters for the New York Times in Benghazi[98] as President Obama's investigators failed to interview him.[99]

Barack Hussein Obama's ""Mission Accomplished""
Obama launched the war in Libya giving the reason for the need to avoid a ""humanitarian"" catastrophe. Not that Gaddafi's gone, lawlessness, brutality, and religious intolerance has increased. ""Thousands of people, including women and children, are being illegally detained by rebel militias in Libya,"" and ""up to 7,000 new ""enemies of the state"", ""disappeared"" in a dysfunctional system, without recourse to law. [18] A church bombing by the end of 2012 left two dead,[100] and in February 2013 four foreign nationals were arrested for distributing Bible pamphlets. They may face the death penalty.[101]


We all thought Libya had moved on – it has, but into lawlessness and ruin. Libya has plunged unnoticed into its worst political and economic crisis since the defeat of Gaddafi. (Thanks to Obama and Hillary). [19]

Two more Americans were killed, along with 35 others, after being taken hostage by rebel jihadists in Mali shortly after the Libyan upheaval.[102]
Hillary Clinton testified before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the wake of the Benghazi murders that occurred under her stewardship, that weapons and fighters equipped by the Obama administration made their way into Mali and Algeria:



 “

 There is no doubt that the Algerian terrorists had weapons from Libya. There is no doubt that the Malian remnants of AQIM [Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb] have weapons from Libya.[103]

 ”


President Vladimir Putin of Russia observed, ""Upheaval in Libya, accompanied by the uncontrolled proliferation of arms, contributed to the deterioration of the situation in Mali. Terrorist attacks in Algeria that took away the lives of innocent people – including those from foreign countries – became the consequences of such tragic developments.""[104]

1972 presidential election,https://www.conservapedia.com/1972_presidential_election,"Republican President Richard Nixon was deeply involved in the strategy of Détente, the plan to end Cold War when he came up for reelection in 1972.  He was unanimously renominated by the Republican party for reelection as president.

Democratic primaries
Hubert Humphrey accused George McGovern of violating campaign spending limits they had agreed upon. McGovern accused Richard Nixon of failing to ""wage an effective war on drugs and narcotics gangsters"" and suggested ""the Federal Communications Commission should intervene against television and radio commercials suggesting that certain drugs are the answer to emotional or behavioral problems.""[1]

Democratic nomination
The Democratic party was deeply split after their near-collapse in 1968 and in 1972 the leftwing faction won out, then self-destructed. The nominee after a nasty primary battle was South Dakota Senator George McGovern, and initially his running mate was Thomas Eagleton. Eagleton had a secret history of mental illness (complete with electric shock treatments to his brain) that was revealed after he accepted the nomination. Although McGovern said he was ""1000% behind Eagleton,"" the insanity issue threatened to destroy the credibility of McGovern's crusade and Eagleton was forced off the ticket. Numerous leading Democrats publicly rejected the VP nomination until finally a Daley-supporter and Kennedy in-law, Sargent Shriver, accepted. Polls showed Nixon winning a huge landslide, as indeed happened. 

General election
The McGovern camp counted on the vote of young people disaffected by the Vietnam War to boost their support as the voting age was dropped from 21 down to 18.  Their turnout stayed low.
Nixon ridiculed McGovern as the far left-candidate of ""acid, abortion and amnesty"" (""acid"" meant illegal drugs; abortion was now an issue; McGovern favored amnesty for draft dodgers.)  Instead Nixon promised that peace was at hand, and indeed peace was reached with the Vietnam war ending in January, 1973. It seemed as well that Nixon's détente policy was ending the Cold War.  Peace and prosperity against a confused opponent leading a bitterly divided Democratic party.
Nixon was running a nonpartisan campaign separate from the Republican Party in the hopes of winning over many Democrats and independents.  He was fearful that this new approach would be sabotaged by the Democrats, so he authorized ""dirty tricks"" to discover what the Democrats were planning. His operatives broke into the Democratic National Headquarters at the Watergate Hotel, and were caught. Nixon desperately tried to cover up the crime and divert suspicion away from him, and he was successful for a while. 
The voters overwhelmingly chose Nixon with the numerically highest popular vote margin in history (though Warren G. Harding won a slightly higher percentage margin in 1920).

1860 presidential election,https://www.conservapedia.com/1860_presidential_election," 1860 Presidential election results
The 1860 election was hotly divided between North and South over the issue of slavery.  The Republican party, hated in the South, nominated Abraham Lincoln.  The south was divided in its choice for a candidate, deadlocking the Democratic National Convention by their insistence that the platform advocate allowing slavery in every territory.  They also refused to accept Stephen A. Douglas, who had formerly said that a territory could prohibit slavery by refusing to pass legislation protecting it.[1]  As a result, the Democratic party split:  the Northern Democrats nominated Stephen A. Douglas and the Southern Democrats nominated Vice-President John C. Breckinridge.  A few former Whigs, calling themselves the Constitutional Union Party, also nominated a Presidential candidate with the sole platform of preserving the Union.  Lincoln was not even on the ballot in most Southern states.  The results showed:

2010 Ecological Disaster,https://www.conservapedia.com/2010_Ecological_Disaster," President Obama directed the United States Coast Guard to dump toxic disperants into the Gulf of Mexico despite known health hazards to humans and wildlife. [3]The Gulf of Mexico oil spill began on 20 April 2010 when the Deepwater Horizon offshore oil drilling rig operated by BP (known as British Petroleum until 2000) exploded and sank.[1] Oil began leaking at a rate eventually estimated at 2.5 million gallons per day, resulting in massive environmental degradation.[2] The federal government reported that 206 million gallons of crude oil leaked before the spill was stopped on July 15.[3] The blowout killed eleven workers. Despite the known toxicity of the dispersant Corexit, the Obama administration dumped millions of gallons of the hazardous chemical into the Gulf of Mexico with C-130 aircraft provided by the U.S. Coast Guard[4] and the Air Force.[5]
On 31 March 2010 President Obama announced a plan for exploitation of offshore oil reserves during a speech at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington, D.C.[6] The President's actions have been labeled, ""a decision to endanger our coastal ecosystems with the risk of catastrophic oil spills.""[7] Defending the decision, the President remarked,



 “

 oil rigs today generally don’t cause spills. They are technologically very advanced.""[8][9]

 ”


Since taking office the Obama administration approved 346 oil drilling plans without securing permits required by law from the federal agency that assesses environmental impacts.[10] President Barack Obama has been widely criticized for an unprepared and bungled response, most notably from former supporters.

As of 15 July  2010 BP announced that the gushing well had been successfully capped. As of 4 August the government reported that only 26% of the originally leaked oil could be located in the Gulf.[11]

The Obama plan
 Map of expanded areas of offshore oil drilling authorized by President Obama on 31 March 2010.[12]Source: United States Department of Interior.
Obama called for expanded development and production throughout the Gulf of Mexico. The Department of Interior's Minerals Management Service (MMS) estimates that the Gulf of Mexico contains 36-41.5 billion barrels of  oil and 161-207 trillion cubic feet of natural gas resources. According a DOI press release, Obama's plan would ""expand oil and gas development and exploration"" while ""protecting fisheries, tourism, and places off U.S. coasts that are not appropriate for development.""[13]
The Associated Press has reported on the role ex-government regulators play in lobbying and influence; the chief of staff of the MSS's Gulf of Mexico region once stated that deep water drilling had ""few or no regulations or standards.""[14] Two years later the senior official left his job in the MMS to work for BP.[15] During President Obama's first year in office, as BP's regulatory compliance and environmental manager, the ex-MMS official lobbied the U.S. Ocean Policy Task Force to ""carefully weigh policies that may establish exclusionary zones"" or ""disrupt the MMS leasing program,"" according to a statement posted at whitehouse.gov.[16] He further stated that BP wanted access to off-limit areas such as the eastern Gulf of Mexico[17] which President Obama approved in March 2010.
Total U.S. offshore crude oil production in 2009 was 1.7 million barrels a day, of which 1.6 million barrels a day came from the U.S. section of the Gulf of Mexico.[18]
According to the New York Times, President Obama ""said several times during his presidential campaign that he supported expanded offshore drilling. He noted in his State of the Union address[19] in January [2010] that weaning the country from imported oil would require “tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development.”[20][21]
When questioned about the Obama regulators ""cozy relationship"" with oil companies the president responded, ""absolutely I take responsibility for that.""[22]

Obama administration asks Court to allow BP drilling in the Gulf of Mexico
Less than four months after President Barack Obama took office a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. found that the U.S. Government was unprepared for a major spill at sea, relying on an ""irrational"" environmental analysis of the risks of offshore drilling. The Obama administration urged the court to revisit the decision. In its arguments to the court, the Obama administration said that the loss of royalties on the oil, estimated at almost $10 billion, ""may have significant financial consequences for the federal government."" 
Among the existing leases was the Lease Sale #206. That deal included BP's acquisition, for $34 million, of the acreage encompassing the Deep Water Horizons well.
A day after the administration's petition, the industry's main lobbying group, the American Petroleum Institute, made its own case echoing the government's arguments. ""The significance of [Gulf of Mexico] activities under the five-year program cannot be overstated,"" the API argued.
Secretary Ken Salazar expressed confidence that problems within the Minerals Management Service that led to poor oversight of offshore drilling were resolved. In September 2009, in testimony before the House Natural Resources Committee, Salazar listed steps he had taken to make sure problems ""don't occur in the future.""
In Senate hearings held in mid-November 2009, Obama MMS Deputy Director Walter Cruickshank assured the Committee panel fears of containing a catastrophic blowout were misplaced, saying the U.S. had ""what we believe is the most aggressive oil spill contingency planning...in the world.""[23]

Approval of BP's response plan
The Obama administration accepted and approved BP's regional oil spill response plan for the Gulf of Mexico dated 30 June 2009[24] and covered all the company’s operations in the Gulf. The plan lists 

“Sea Lions, Seals, Sea Otters [and] Walruses” as “Sensitive Biological Resources” in the Gulf, suggesting that portions were cribbed from previous Arctic exploratory planning;
 Gives a web site for a Japanese home shopping site as the link to one of its “primary equipment providers for BP in the Gulf of Mexico Region [for] rapid deployment of spill response resources on a 24 hour, 7 days a week basis;” and
 Directs its media spokespeople to never make “promises that property, ecology, or anything else will be restored to normal.”[25]
The government approved plan made no mention about tracking sub-surface oil plumes from deepwater blowouts or preventing disease (viruses, bacteria, etc.) transmission to captured animals in rehabilitation facilities.

British Petroleum
During the first 100 days of the Obama administration, the Minerals Management Service (MMS) of the Department of the Interior granted a “categorical exclusion” from a detailed environmental impact statement required under law[26] to BP's Deepwater Horizon drilling operation, according to the Washington Post.[27] BP's exploration plan received in the Administration's MMS field office on 23 March 2009 states ""no mitigation measures other than those required by regulation and BP policy will be employed to avoid, diminish or eliminate potential impacts on environmental resources."" It declared any spill would have only ""sub-lethal"" effects on fish and marine mammals but it was ""unlikely that an accidental oil spill would occur from the proposed activities.""[28]
As Senator, and while running for president, Barack Obama received a total of $77,051 from BP[29] and has taken more money from BP's Political Action Committee and individuals connected with BP over the past 20 years than any other candidate, according to FEC disclosure records.[30] Likewise, the independent watchdog Center for Responsive Politics noted, ""the “top recipient of BP-related donations during the 2008 cycle was President Barack Obama himself.”[31][32]

 Obama approved drilling permits for BP without the statutory requirement to file an environmental impact assessment,[33] the handling of spills in a worst-case scenario,[34] and fostered a cozy relationship between government and the oil industry.[35] No other candidate took more money from BP in the past two decades than Obama received in only six years.[36]
Talk show personality Ed Schultz of MSNBC reiterated a call for campaign finance reform as a result of Barack Obama's ties to BP and the government's response.[37]
Transocean, owner of the Deepwater Horizons drilling rig leased to BP, was the recipient of the Obama Mineral Management Service's, Safety Award for Excellence.[38][39] On 30 April 2010 Transocean's stock fell after President Obama’s chief strategist, David Axelrod, made comments nine days into the disaster and the government raised estimates to more than fives times of what had previously been reported about how much oil was leaking into the Gulf of Mexico.[40]
It has been reported in the financial press that among owners of BP[41] are 

New Jersey Division of Investment (51 million shares)
California Public Employees Retirement System (36 million shares)
Pennsylvania Public School Employees Retirement System (7.1 million shares)
Teachers Retirement System of Alabama (4.5 million shares)
Employees Retirement System of Texas (4.1 million shares)
Ohio Public Employees Retirement System (1.1 million shares)
Illinois State Board of Investment (1.1 million shares)[42]
Indiana Public Employees' Retirement Fund (0.7 million shares)
Washington State Investment Board (1.2 million shares)
United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (21.9 million shares). 
BP was found wilfully negligent during the Bush administration in a Texas refinery explosion incident, and was assessed $108 million in fines - the highest workplace safety fines in U.S. history.[43]

Nalco and Corexit
 Dermatitis is one immediate health concern[44] of the Obama administration's decision to use toxic substances to disperse the visibility of the spill.  [4] Residents, cleanup workers, and tourists alike may be affected. [5]
Nalco of Naperville, Illinois formed a joint venture with Exxon Chemical in 1994 and the company's current leadership includes several executives from BP. Nalco reported it sold in excess of $40 million to BP of its dispersant, Corexit, shortly after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster.
Of 18 dispersants approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 12 were found to be more effective on southern Louisiana crude than Corexit, EPA data show.[45] Two of the 12 were found to be 100 percent effective on Gulf of Mexico crude, whereas two Corexit products rated only 56 percent and 63 percent effective.[46] The toxicity of the other 12 was shown to be in some cases 10 or 20 times less than Corexit, according to the EPA.[47] ""It's a chemical that the oil industry makes to sell to itself, basically,"" said Richard Charter, a senior policy adviser for Defenders of Wildlife.[48]
Corexit was found to be one of the most toxic dispersal agents ever developed.[49] With seasonal warming of water temperature the toxicity grows.  Corexit is banned in the United Kingdom due to environmental concerns.[50] The Obama EPA gave BP the green light to apply Corexit to the spill.[51]  At the Congressional hearing investigating the Gulf oil spill disaster, Democratic Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York raised the prospect of ""thousands and thousands of people getting sick or dying"" as a result of the administration's sanctioned use of the dispersant.[52] Critics allege use of dispersants like Corexit are largely for cosmetic purposes. Nalco has been a frequent contributor to the campaign of Sen. Mary Landrieu[53] of Louisiana.[54]

Deepwater Horizon
 Fire boat response crews battle the blazing remnants of the off shore oil rig Deepwater Horizon, April 21, 2010 (U.S. Coast Guard)
On Earth Day 2010, a BP-leased oil drilling rig sank to the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico two days after it exploded, creating what has been described as the ""worst environmental disaster in US history.""[55] Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar told CNN ""It potentially is catastrophic,"" and ""I think we have to prepare for the worst.""[56][57]
Congressional investigators think they have identified the rigs blowout preventer as the cause of the explosion.[58] The blowout preventer was leaking hydraulic fluid, had a dead battery,[59] and was inspected by the Obama Minerals Management Service (MMS) only two weeks before to the explosion[60] which killed 11 people. Amy Goodman, a leftist radio talk show host, has suggested those responsible should be prosecuted for manslaughter.[61]
Blowout preventers are meant to shut off the well, and the last line of defense is a set of shear rams which cut the pipe and seal off the well.[62] The MMS, the Obama administration agency that regulates offshore drilling along with the Coast Guard, is supposed to require  proof that shear rams are powerful enough to shut the well. Michael Saucier, MMS's regional supervisor testified before Congress that the MMS did not require BP to file a ""scenario for potential blowout.""[63] The MMS certified that BP ""has the capacity to respond, to the maximum extent practicable, to a worst-case discharge, or a substantial threat of such a discharge.""[64]
A May 2010 Inspector General's report revealed at least two MMS regulatory inspectors admitted to being under the influence of the illegal drug methamphetamine while on the job.[65][66]

Environmental disaster
 Projections of the flow of the spill over the summer of 2010. [6]
On 29 April 2010 oil began washing ashore in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana; four weeks later local leaders still were begging President Obama for federal assistance in responding to the disaster which was overtaking hundreds of miles of shoreline.[67]
Crude oil has washed into marshes, estuaries and onto beaches in Mississippi and Alabama. Wildlife has been killed and efforts are underway to save oil-coated
birds. Without capping the well Florida's Everglades may be turned into a ""dead zone."" Scientists expect currents to carry the oil slick to the eastern seaboard of the United States, fouling beaches and estuaries like the Chesapeake Bay and fishing grounds of the Grand Banks off Newfoundland.

Silverfish
Most scientists agree that Corexit 9500 will have a much larger biological effect when it reaches coastal areas teeming with wildlife.[68]  Many species are being threatened at a crucial time in their life cycle.[69] In testing done by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency the dispersant Corexit 9500 was found to be extremely lethal to silverfish, a benchmark organism in toxicity testing.[70]

Gulf menhaden
Gulf menhaden are a species harvested mostly for fish meal and fish oil. Menhaden could be badly affected
by the spill.

Coral, oyster and shrimp
Corals, oyster and shrimp likewise are critically affected. Richard Charter, a foremost expert on marine biology and oil spills who is a senior policy advisor for Marine Programmes for Defenders of Wildlife and is chairman of the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary Advisory Council has said, “There is a chemical toxicity to the dispersant compound that in many ways is worse than oil,” which ""in so doing you may be more seriously damaging the ecosystem offshore.”[71] Shrimp were found to be extremely vulnerable to the lethal effects of the chemical dispersant Corexit 9500 used by Obama administration disaster relief agencies and BP in testing done by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).[72]

Brown pelican
 Dead birds and sea turtles.
The Louisiana state bird, the Brown Pelican, was removed from protection under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 2009. The Obama administration approved BP's Deepwater Horizon drilling rig without the proper environmental impact assessment (EIA) required by law. The disaster occurred just as breeding season commenced.

Other bird species
Other species endangered by the oil spill are American oystercatcher and Wilson's plover.

Sea turtles
As several species of sea turtles move through the Gulf during their spring nesting season, they need to surface to breathe.

Toxic oil spill rain
A report prepared by the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources warned that the leaking crude oil into  the Gulf of Mexico is about to become the worst environmental catastrophe in all of human history, threatening the entire eastern half of North America with “total destruction.” Russian scientists based the assessment on the use of millions of gallons of the government approved chemical dispersant Corexit. 
The Russian scientists outlined that Corexit, with its 2.61ppm toxicity level,  combined with the seasonal warming of Gulf of Mexico waters, the molecules will be able to “phase transition” from their present liquid to a gaseous state allowing them to be absorbed into clouds and released as “toxic rain” upon all of Eastern North America.
The scientists warned should a Hurricane Katrina like storm form in the Gulf while tens of millions of gallons of Corexit are floating on or near the surface, the resulting “toxic rain” falling upon the North American continent could “theoretically” destroy all microbial life to any depth it reaches resulting in an “unimaginable environmental catastrophe” destroying all kinds of life forms.[73]

The response
Initially Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Coast Guard reported on 23 April 2010 there was no leak from the sunken oil rig.[74] The next day the Obama administration officially estimated a leak from the sunken well at 1000 barrels per day.[75] The Associated Press reported it took nine days after the explosion and the tragic loss of 11 workers lives before Obama made public commenta and acknowledged the disaster[76] and appointed a national incident commander.[77]
BP's stock fell[78] on news of the ""the worsening oil spill. "" Administration estimates were raised to 5000 barrels per day.[79]

U.S. Government dumps toxic dispersants into the Gulf of Mexico
 After President Obama's approval of the Deepwater Horizon's drilling rig permit and regulatory failures costing 11 workers their lives, the flow of oil into the Gulf of Mexico continued unabated for 86 days.
Wired Science reports the Obama administration disaster-relief agencies are using a toxic chemical to disperse oil in the Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster. Use of dispersants are said to be a public relations strategy.[80] Secretary Janet Napolitano of the Department of Homeland Security acknowledged[81] the U.S government was dumping toxic chemicals from C-130 cargo aircraft onto the spill.[82] Jackie Savitz of the ocean-conservation group Oceana stated the use of dispersants is only slightly less horrendous than the Gulf oil spill itself. ""You're basically pouring chemicals into the ocean, which is never a good thing.""[83] According to a 2009 Environmental Protection Agency report dispersants have not been used in the United State prior to the Obama administration's approval at BP'S request ""because of possible long-term environmental effects, difficulties with timely and effective application, disagreement among scientists and research data about their environmental effects, effectiveness, and toxicity concerns"" and the effects ""are still unknown.""[84] Residents in areas close to the oil spill have reported odors and symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, nausea, eye irritation, and respiratory problems.[85]

Disregard for worker safety
 Cleanup workers exposed to the Obama adminsitration's decision to use known toxic substances to disperse the spill. Critics allege dispersants are ineffective and largely for cosmetic purposes.
The Guardian (uk) has reported the controversy over Corexit exposes the Obama administration to criticism that its scientific agencies have been too accommodating to BP's strategy. In addition to the use of Corexit, the Obama Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) came under fire for withholding test results on the toxicity of the water close to shore.[86]
The dispersant 2-BE is known to cause heath dangers to clean up workers[87] and wildlife alike.[88] 2-BE has been documented to cause the breakdown of red blood cells, leading to blood in  urine and feces, and can damage the kidneys, liver, spleen and bone marrow of humans – effects not included on the information sheet for workers.[89] The dispersant Corexit 9500 is associated with headaches, vomiting and reproductive problems as sides effects to clean-up workers.[90] Lawrence Duffy of the University of Alaska claims dispersants ""are more a public relations measure than a preventive one. It has an effect on our psychology because we don't see the oil slick,""[91] though oil particles continue to do damage.[92]

Government mismanagement of relief efforts
Three weeks into the disaster National Public Radio reported the Obama administration's official figures were still grossly underestimated[93] and after the first month it was finally admitted the spill was nearly three times larger than earlier thought.[94]
Federal officials did not begin burning the leaking oil off the surface of the water until one full week after the rig collapsed.[95] Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal criticized President Obama for his slow response.[96] The New York Times castigated the White House for delays and not moving quick enough, calling the evidence ""damning"" and declaring the Gulf oil spill a ""huge disaster whose consequences might have been minimized with swifter action"" from the Obama administration.[97] One month into the spill, Democratic stalwarts James Carville,[98] Chris Matthews,[99] and Donna Brazile[100] criticized the inept and bungled response to the spreading catastrophe.

The White House lacked any type of plan to combat the disaster. House Democratic Majority Leader Steny Hoyer publicly admitted that the Obama Administration was ill-prepared to deal with the situation.[103]  While the disaster steadily grew, Obama did not discuss the crisis at length until he appeared at a photo op at Venice, Louisiana on 3 May 2010.[104]   He would order a moratorium on all future deep sea oil platforms until they determine the problems associated with the current situation. As to be expected, Obama tries to remove himself from blame saying ""the system failed"", this despite the fact the he heads the system. Then he pointed fingers of blame at oil companies while taking an indirect jab at the Bush administration.[105]



 “

 For too long, for a decade or more, there has been a cozy relationship between the oil companies and the federal agency that permits them to drill. It seems as if permits were too often issued based on little more than assurances of safety from the oil companies. That cannot and will not happen anymore.

 ”


White House spokesman Robert Gibbs did his best to put a good spin on the disaster claiming the response was ""comprehensive and fast.""  Meanwhile, the Democrat-led Congress ordered public hearings from oil executives. President Obama blamed others saying the answers from oil executives were a ""ridiculous spectacle,"" ""You had executives of BP and Transocean and Halliburton falling over each other to point the finger of blame at somebody else."" [106] As the disaster progressed and questions arose over the government's misreporting and withholding[107] of information from the public about the true dimensions of the calamity, the Associated Press noted, 



 “

 First [Obama] was going to make BP pay for the Gulf oil mess. Then he declared himself in charge. Now he's trying to find out 'whose ass to kick' and making clear he'd fire BP's chief if only he could.[108]

Revitalizing cap and trade energy tax
Main article: Cap and trade
President Obama has been roundly criticized by Democrats and Republicans alike for attempting to use the national tragedy to revitalized his failed Cap and Trade energy proposals. The Obama proposal, widely perceived as a job-killer tax increase, has stalled in the U.S. Senate. California Senator Dianne Feinstein has stated the climate bill ""isn't going to stop the oil leak.""[109]
Environmentalists want the President to push the program. Fred Krupp of the Environmental Defense Fund calls the opportunity ""a political moment"" to pass a carbon tax estimated to cost the average U.S. household $4300 per year.[110]
Joel Benenson, who conducted polling for Obama’s presidential campaign, thinks the tax increase could pass, but wary Senate Democrats say otherwise. “There’s not a great call for it"" said West Virginia Democratic Senator Jay Rockefeller. “It’s unrelated” to the immediate crisis in the Gulf noted Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat from Nebraska.[111]


Assistance of foreign governments
Nearly two-months after the disaster took place, the Obama administration decides to utilize the assistance offered by 17 countries, the U.N and the European Union.[112] International aid offers already accepted include two skimmers and 2.6 miles (4.2 kilometers) of boom from Mexico, three sets of sweeping arm systems from the Netherlands and 1.86 miles (3.0 kilometers) of boom from Canada, the State Department said. The State Department noted that it has assisted BP in directly sourcing equipment and technical experts from around the world, including from Algeria, Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Latvia, Norway, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom.[113]

Public relations offensive
Faced with declining poll numbers and a public relations calamity, President Obama took to the airwaves nearly 60 days into the spill. A New York Times Op-ed commented,



 “

 All we got from President Obama was a vague call for some sort of new energy policy. Plus a Gulf Coast Restoration Plan, an oil spill study commission, a reminder that the secretary of energy won a Nobel Prize in physics and 17 references to God, prayer, blessings or faith.[114][115]

 ”


Former speechwriter for President Jimmy Carter, Chris Matthews, chided the President after his address to the nation,



 “

 Ludicrous that he keeps saying [Secretary of Energy] Chu has a Nobel prize. I'll barf if he does it one more time.[116]

 ”


Misrepresentation of evidence
Drilling moratorium based on junk science
The Washington Post reported in November 2010 the oil spill that damaged the Gulf of Mexico's reefs and wetlands also threatens to stain the Obama administration's reputation for relying on science to guide policy. The Department of Interior's concluded that the White House edited a drilling safety report in a way that made it falsely appear that scientists and experts backed the administration's six-month moratorium on new deep-water drilling. The editing changes by the White House resulted ""in the implication that the moratorium recommendation had been peer reviewed."" But it hadn't been. Outside scientists were asked only to review new safety measures for offshore drilling.[117]
In October 2010 the Presidential Oil Spill Commission said that the White House Office of Management and Budget delayed publication of a scientific report that forecast how much oil could reach the gulf's shores. The report said that President Obama's energy adviser and Socialist International operative Carol Browner,[118] mischaracterized on national TV a government analysis about where the oil went, saying it showed most of the oil was ""gone."" It also said Browner and the head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Jane Lubchenco, contributed to the public's perception that the report was more exact than it was.
Academics, environmentalists and federal investigators have accused the administration since the April 2010 spill of downplaying scientific findings, misrepresenting data and misconstruing the opinions of experts it solicited.[119]

Economic impacts
 Oil slick map as of May 30, 2010.
The economic impact of the Gulf of Mexico oil drilling disaster will be large and devastating to several key industries, including fishing, tourism, and transportation.[120]
The top commercial species in terms of value are shrimp ($367 million), menhaden ($64 million), oysters ($59 million), and blue crab ($38 million).[121] As of 25 May 2010, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) closed 54,096 square miles to commercial and recreational fishing.[122] These areas are some of the richest fishing grounds in the Gulf of Mexico for major commercial species such as white shrimp, blue crab, and oysters.

Employment in fishing
The most immediate economic impact of the oil spill has been on the Gulf fishing[123] industry. The number of jobs at stake, which includes seafood processing and related wholesale and retail, is over 200,000 with related economic activity of $5.5 billion.[124]
Dockside sales in Louisiana are approximately $660 million.[125] Loses to the Louisiana fishing could  be as high as $2.5 billion.[126]

Employment in tourism
The tourist industry employs 620,000 people who earn over $9 billion in wages in the Gulf of Mexico region. Analysts say Florida alone could lose $3 billion in tourism.[127]
In 2008, recreational anglers took 25.4 million fishing trips and spent over $12 billion on equipment and trips in the Gulf region.[128] Some of the most popular recreational species include snappers, several types of drum, sheepshead, and Spanish mackerel. Recreational fisheries support businesses such as charters, bait and tackle, and services such as restaurants and hotels. 
In 2000, 21.9 million people visited Gulf beaches and accounted for 177.2 million beach days.[129]

Transportation
The Offshore Marine Service Association (OMSA),[130] the national trade association for U.S. flag vessels in the energy sector, criticized the Obama administration's moratorium on offshore drilling projects. 100,000 jobs were immediately affected by the president's decision as companies began cancelling contracts to carry supplies, forcing layoffs. ""The industry has struggled to climb out of a severe economic downturn. The moratorium threatens any hope of recovery and creates the potential for economic hardship that could last a decade or longer,"" remarked OMSA President Ken Wells.
OMSA estimates that for every mariner who works on board a vessel, there are nine other Americans working in shore-side jobs that support vessel operations. Beyond the vessel crew, the negative consequences of the moratorium could impact everyone from service technicians supporting everything from diesel engines to the air condition systems to the local grocer who supplies food for the boat's galley.
Offshore vessels are a major part of the tax base in many coastal communities. Gulf Coast state and local government revenues will also decrease due to lower income tax and sales tax collections.
Disruption of shipping traffic in and out of the Port of New Orleans will impact barge, container, and tanker traffic in the Mississippi Delta and along the Mississippi River.  Prices of all types of commodities would affected.

Insurance industry
BP, the operator on the oil drilling lease with a 65% stake, insured itself, rather than buying coverage from insurance companies. Industry analysts estimate total costs related to the oil spill cleanup and damages could exceed $14 billion.[131]

Lost revenue to state and local governments
Louisiana
A Greater New Orleans study indicates the Obama administration's moratorium could cost Louisiana as many as 22,000 jobs and more than $782 million in revenues.
With the average deepwater rig employing 230 workers with an average salary of $98,000, the study puts the tax revenue impact at $151 million if drilling were to resume within 18 months. Greater New Orleans President and CEO Michael Hecht says it’s difficult to be optimistic based on President Obama’s Oval Office address on 15 June 2010. President Obama's action “has the potential to turn an ecological tragedy into an economic calamity,” Hecht said.[132] The study foresees in a worse case scenario the loss of more than 22,000 jobs, 3,450 of them directly tied to the operating rigs and 18,945 with indirect ties such as catering firms and other companies that serve U.S energy producers.
Fearing that the drilling moratorium ""could exacerbate, rather than alleviate, the impacts of this spill upon both our economy and our environment,"" U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu wrote to President Obama on 11 June 2010.[133] Landrieu stated, 



 “

 more than 300,000 Louisianians are employed either directly or indirectly by the oil and gas industry. ..The immediate impacts to the economy are devastating enough: idling the 33 rigs currently permitted to drill in the deepwater Gulf would immediately impact employment for roughly 38,000 crewmen, deck hands, engineers, welders, ROV operators, caterers, helicopter pilots, and others who operate and service these vessels. That's like closing 12 large motor vehicle assembly plants in one state, all at once.

 ”


Lost state and local tax revenues will accrue at a rate between $8 million and $15 million a month. Federal royalty losses will be substantial and a significant drop in tolls collected for the Louisiana Highway 1 bridge at Leeville, the main artery to the Port Fourchon energy port is projected as well.

Texas
The Texas state comptroller’s office reported collection of $2.3 billion in oil and natural gas production taxes in fiscal year 2009 and $4.1 billion in 2008. The tax revenue is used to repair roads and fund schools, among other state services. Although no official analysis of President Obama's decision to place a moratorium on offshore production has been compiled yet, the Texas comptroller’s office said it’s unclear how much of an impact the president's decision will have on state services. Experts warn the president's decision could threaten tens of thousands of jobs in the Houston area.[134]

Alabama
Manufacturing jobs in Alabama are at risk as a result of President Obama's actions, as no new orders for equipment are coming in.[135]

Increased dependency on foreign oil
New Jersey Democrat Senator Robert Menendez proposed a ban on new offshore drilling permits and submitted a bill that would retroactively raise the financial liability of BP from $75 million to $10 billion.[136] Oklahoma Republican Senator James Inhofe successfully killed the bill saying it would reduce competition and shut down smaller independent oil companies in favor of larger companies.

Too big to fail
An oil industry trade publication[137] reports President Obama and senior White House staff, as well as Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, are working with BP on legislation that would raise the cap on liability for damage claims from those affected by the oil disaster from $75 million to $10 billion. However the disaster has the real potential of costing nearly $1 trillion. Critics point out that in the deal between Obama and BP, $10 billion is a drop in the bucket for a trillion dollar disaster. Talk is noted in government circles, including FEMA, of the need to nationalize BP in order to compensate those who will ultimately be affected by the worst oil disaster in the history of the world, and BP would, if its assets were nationalized, be credited with almost a trillion dollars for compensation purposes.[138][139]
After Obama charged Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate the disaster, BP establish a $20 billion extrajudicial fund managed by an Obama appointee.[140] Former CNN news writer and radio talk show host Mike Malloy suggested Holder is beholden to corporatist interests.[141]

Criticism of the Obama administration's handling of the disaster
 Memorial service for the 11 workers killed in the explosion.Reuters [8]
Former top adviser to President Bill Clinton, James Carville, turned visibly emotional in an interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC's Good Morning America over President Barack Obama's ""lackadaisical"" response to the Gulf oil spill disaster. 



 “

 The political stupidity is unbelievable. ... The President of the United States  could have come down here. He could have been involved with the families of these 11 people...... He could have implemented a plan in anticipation of this... He could be commandeering tankers and making BP bring tankers in and clean this up.... He could be deploying people to the coast. He could be with the corps of engineers and the Coast Guard with these people in Plaquemines Parish, doing something about these regulations. These people are crying. They're begging for something down here. And it just looks like he's not involved in this! Man, you have got to get down here and take control of this! Put somebody in charge of this and get this thing moving! We're about to die down here![142][143][144]

 ”


Carville also said in a separate interview on CNN with Anderson Cooper,



 “

 They are risking everything by this ‘go along with BP’ strategy they have. They seem, like, lackadaisical on this...they seem like they’re inconvenienced by this, this is some giant thing getting in their way and somehow or another, if you let BP handle it, it’ll all go away. It’s not going away. It’s growing out there. It is a disaster of the first magnitude...the government thinks that they are partnering with BP. I think they actually believe that BP has some kind of a good motivation here. That’s one of the, sort of, whole flaws is they're naïve.[145][146]

 ”


Obama acknowledged the criticism days later in a televised press conference:



 “

 Where I was wrong was in my belief that the oil companies had their act together when it came to worst-case scenarios.[147]

 ”


 Day 12 of the Disaster: Obama enjoys an evening of levity and banter with the Washington Press Corps at the White House Correspondent's Dinner.
MSNBC talk show host Chris Matthews[148] said on Jay Leno's Tonight Show,



 “

 The president scares me. He's been acting a little like a Vatican Observer here. When is he actually going to do something? And I worry. I know he doesn't want to take ownership of it. I know politics. He said the minute he says, 'I'm in charge,' he takes the blame.[149]

 ”


Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential campaign manager in 2008 questioned if Democratic primary voters had 



 “

 underestimated the value of experience and crisis management as important attributes for their president.[150]

 ”


Donna Brazile, who managed the presidential campaign of Democratic candidate Al Gore in 2000 said on ABC's This Week,



 “

 One of the problems I have with the administration is that they're not tough enough. They are waiting for BP to say, ‘oh, we've got a new plan to stop the oil leak.’ They need to stop it, contain it, clean it up, and try to help us conserve our coastal wetlands.[151]

 ”


Dick Morris, an intimate adviser to President Bill Clinton observed,



 “

 these failings show that Obama is in over his head. But to the left, which bleeds for each drop of water in the gulf and cries over every turtle or shrimp or sea bird, it is an unpardonable sin...Obama's incompetence and inexperience is causing liberals to see him as arrogant, aloof, removed, conceited, suspicious of outside advice and even lazy...these character defects will haunt the president until 2012 and beyond.[152]

 ”


David Gergen worked in the Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Clinton White House remarked,



 “

 If our government had fought WWII like the way we’re fighting the oil spill, there’s a good chance many of us would be speaking German today.[153]

 ”


Republican Chairman Michael Steele criticized the president for golfing while the oil crisis worsened.[154]



 “

 Until this problem is fixed, no more golf outings.

 ”


Peggy Noonan, a speech writer for President's Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, summed up public perceptions with,



 “

 The president, in my view, continues to govern in a way that suggests he is chronically detached from the central and immediate concerns of his countrymen.... he has not, almost from the day he was inaugurated, been in sync with the center....The American people have spent at least two years worrying that high government spending would, in the end, undo the republic. They saw the dollars gushing night and day...And now we have a videotape metaphor for all the public’s fears: the well gushing black oil into the Gulf of Mexico ...His philosophy is that it is appropriate for the federal government to occupy a more burly, significant and powerful place in America—confronting its problems of need, injustice, inequality. ... Then the oil spill came and government could not do the job, could not meet the need ...Katrina illustrate[d] that even though the federal government in our time has continually taken on new missions and responsibilities, the more it took on, the less it seemed capable of performing even its most essential jobs. Conservatives got this point—they know it without being told—but liberals and progressives did not. They thought Katrina was the result only of George W. Bush’s incompetence and conservatives’ failure to “believe in government.” But Mr. Obama was supposed to be competent....It’s not good to have a president in this position—weakened, polarizing and lacking broad public support—less than halfway through his term. That it is his fault is no comfort.[155]

 ”


New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd wrote,



 “

 Obama and top aides who believe in his divinity make a mistake to dismiss complaints of his aloofness as Washington white noise. He treats the press as a nuisance rather than examining his own inability to encapsulate Americans’ feelings.[156]

 ”


Actor Robert Redford demanded action from the Obama administration. The liberal special interest group Natural Resources Defense Council has Redford in a new ad decrying the lackluster response.[157] Redford made an appearance on MSNBC and said there is no one manning this ship,



 “

 In this case, we don’t need a disaster manager, we need a leader.

 ”


Liberal Hollywood director James Cameron says;



 “

 Over the last few weeks I've watched, as we all have, with growing horror and heartache, watching what's happening in the Gulf and thinking those morons don't know what they're doing.[158]

 ”


Obnoxious Hollywood liberal Rosie O'Donnell said, ""We broke the womb of freaking mother Earth.""  [159] In addition, O'Donnell accused BP of



 “

 willful homicide, willful mass murder"" and demanded BP be nationalized immediately: ""I say seize their assets. Right now. Seize their assets today. Take over the company.

 ”


Brad Pitt, appears in a Spike Lee film denouncing the oil spill and his desire to see BP executives get the death penalty.[160]


Foreign reaction
Relations between allies the U.K. and U.S. are now at historic lows thanks to Barack Obama's mishandling of the oil spill. Britain had been repeatedly mocked by Obama prior to the spill[161][162][163] but now find themselves subjected to endless propaganda. Prominent foreign dignitaries have expressed the public's growing frustration with the administration's posturing and hunt for scapegoats. The mayor of London, Boris Johnson, who supported Obama in 2008, decried ""anti-British rhetoric, buck-passing and name-calling"" while Lord Tebbit branded Mr Obama's conduct “despicable” and the president's rhetoric 



 “

 a crude, bigoted, xenophobic display of partisan political Presidential petulance.""[164][165]

 ”


The atmosphere Obama created in Britain is so toxic that the British press has labelled Barack Obama the most unpopular man in England.[166]

And if the House of Representatives shall not choose a President whenever the right of choice shall devolve upon them, before the fourth day of March next following, then the Vice-President shall act as President, as in the case of the death or other constitutional disability of the President.
The person having the greatest number of votes as Vice-President, shall be the Vice-President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed, and if no person have a majority, then from the two highest numbers on the list, the Senate shall choose the Vice-President; a quorum for the purpose shall consist of two-thirds of the whole number of Senators, and a majority of the whole number shall be necessary to a choice. But no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.


 ”


This amendment was ratified in 1804.  This amendment fixed a problem discovered in the Electoral College in the election of 1800, when the presidential candidate Thomas Jefferson received the same number of votes as the vice presidential candidate Aaron Burr, forcing the House of Representatives to select the President.  There would not be another amendment to the Constitution until after the Civil War.

1930 Midterm Elections,https://www.conservapedia.com/1930_Midterm_Elections,"In the midterm elections of 1930, the Democratic Party gained 49 seats from the Republican Party in the U.S. House of Representatives and gained 8 seats in the U.S. Senate. Democrats won the governorships of Ohio and Massachusetts, long-held Republican strongholds. Franklin D. Roosevelt was easily reelected Governor of New York, where as his victory in 1928 had been a close one. Following Herbert Hoover's sweeping presidential win in 1928, Republicans had controlled Congress since 1919. However, 1930 marked the first election since the 1929 stock market crash, and the Great Depression was in full swing, beginning a period of Democratic Party dominance in the United States. 
Although it appeared Republicans would maintain a narrow majority following the election, a series of special elections gave Democrats a bare one-seat majority in the House and Republicans a one-seat majority in the Senate. Several progressive Republicans gave the Democrats a working majority. Congressional disputes with Hoover played a part in Roosevelt's victory in the 1932 presidential election. Hoover vetoed a federal relief bill, while Roosevelt praised the 72nd Congress. In the 1932 elections, Democrats would go on to gain nearly 100 House seats, leading to the New Deal.

2010 Explosion on Deepwater Horizon drilling rig,https://www.conservapedia.com/2010_Explosion_on_Deepwater_Horizon_drilling_rig," President Obama directed the United States Coast Guard to dump toxic disperants into the Gulf of Mexico despite known health hazards to humans and wildlife. [3]The Gulf of Mexico oil spill began on 20 April 2010 when the Deepwater Horizon offshore oil drilling rig operated by BP (known as British Petroleum until 2000) exploded and sank.[1] Oil began leaking at a rate eventually estimated at 2.5 million gallons per day, resulting in massive environmental degradation.[2] The federal government reported that 206 million gallons of crude oil leaked before the spill was stopped on July 15.[3] The blowout killed eleven workers. Despite the known toxicity of the dispersant Corexit, the Obama administration dumped millions of gallons of the hazardous chemical into the Gulf of Mexico with C-130 aircraft provided by the U.S. Coast Guard[4] and the Air Force.[5]
On 31 March 2010 President Obama announced a plan for exploitation of offshore oil reserves during a speech at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington, D.C.[6] The President's actions have been labeled, ""a decision to endanger our coastal ecosystems with the risk of catastrophic oil spills.""[7] Defending the decision, the President remarked,



 “

 oil rigs today generally don’t cause spills. They are technologically very advanced.""[8][9]

 ”


Since taking office the Obama administration approved 346 oil drilling plans without securing permits required by law from the federal agency that assesses environmental impacts.[10] President Barack Obama has been widely criticized for an unprepared and bungled response, most notably from former supporters.

As of 15 July  2010 BP announced that the gushing well had been successfully capped. As of 4 August the government reported that only 26% of the originally leaked oil could be located in the Gulf.[11]

The Obama plan
 Map of expanded areas of offshore oil drilling authorized by President Obama on 31 March 2010.[12]Source: United States Department of Interior.
Obama called for expanded development and production throughout the Gulf of Mexico. The Department of Interior's Minerals Management Service (MMS) estimates that the Gulf of Mexico contains 36-41.5 billion barrels of  oil and 161-207 trillion cubic feet of natural gas resources. According a DOI press release, Obama's plan would ""expand oil and gas development and exploration"" while ""protecting fisheries, tourism, and places off U.S. coasts that are not appropriate for development.""[13]
The Associated Press has reported on the role ex-government regulators play in lobbying and influence; the chief of staff of the MSS's Gulf of Mexico region once stated that deep water drilling had ""few or no regulations or standards.""[14] Two years later the senior official left his job in the MMS to work for BP.[15] During President Obama's first year in office, as BP's regulatory compliance and environmental manager, the ex-MMS official lobbied the U.S. Ocean Policy Task Force to ""carefully weigh policies that may establish exclusionary zones"" or ""disrupt the MMS leasing program,"" according to a statement posted at whitehouse.gov.[16] He further stated that BP wanted access to off-limit areas such as the eastern Gulf of Mexico[17] which President Obama approved in March 2010.
Total U.S. offshore crude oil production in 2009 was 1.7 million barrels a day, of which 1.6 million barrels a day came from the U.S. section of the Gulf of Mexico.[18]
According to the New York Times, President Obama ""said several times during his presidential campaign that he supported expanded offshore drilling. He noted in his State of the Union address[19] in January [2010] that weaning the country from imported oil would require “tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development.”[20][21]
When questioned about the Obama regulators ""cozy relationship"" with oil companies the president responded, ""absolutely I take responsibility for that.""[22]

Obama administration asks Court to allow BP drilling in the Gulf of Mexico
Less than four months after President Barack Obama took office a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. found that the U.S. Government was unprepared for a major spill at sea, relying on an ""irrational"" environmental analysis of the risks of offshore drilling. The Obama administration urged the court to revisit the decision. In its arguments to the court, the Obama administration said that the loss of royalties on the oil, estimated at almost $10 billion, ""may have significant financial consequences for the federal government."" 
Among the existing leases was the Lease Sale #206. That deal included BP's acquisition, for $34 million, of the acreage encompassing the Deep Water Horizons well.
A day after the administration's petition, the industry's main lobbying group, the American Petroleum Institute, made its own case echoing the government's arguments. ""The significance of [Gulf of Mexico] activities under the five-year program cannot be overstated,"" the API argued.
Secretary Ken Salazar expressed confidence that problems within the Minerals Management Service that led to poor oversight of offshore drilling were resolved. In September 2009, in testimony before the House Natural Resources Committee, Salazar listed steps he had taken to make sure problems ""don't occur in the future.""
In Senate hearings held in mid-November 2009, Obama MMS Deputy Director Walter Cruickshank assured the Committee panel fears of containing a catastrophic blowout were misplaced, saying the U.S. had ""what we believe is the most aggressive oil spill contingency planning...in the world.""[23]

Approval of BP's response plan
The Obama administration accepted and approved BP's regional oil spill response plan for the Gulf of Mexico dated 30 June 2009[24] and covered all the company’s operations in the Gulf. The plan lists 

“Sea Lions, Seals, Sea Otters [and] Walruses” as “Sensitive Biological Resources” in the Gulf, suggesting that portions were cribbed from previous Arctic exploratory planning;
 Gives a web site for a Japanese home shopping site as the link to one of its “primary equipment providers for BP in the Gulf of Mexico Region [for] rapid deployment of spill response resources on a 24 hour, 7 days a week basis;” and
 Directs its media spokespeople to never make “promises that property, ecology, or anything else will be restored to normal.”[25]
The government approved plan made no mention about tracking sub-surface oil plumes from deepwater blowouts or preventing disease (viruses, bacteria, etc.) transmission to captured animals in rehabilitation facilities.

British Petroleum
During the first 100 days of the Obama administration, the Minerals Management Service (MMS) of the Department of the Interior granted a “categorical exclusion” from a detailed environmental impact statement required under law[26] to BP's Deepwater Horizon drilling operation, according to the Washington Post.[27] BP's exploration plan received in the Administration's MMS field office on 23 March 2009 states ""no mitigation measures other than those required by regulation and BP policy will be employed to avoid, diminish or eliminate potential impacts on environmental resources."" It declared any spill would have only ""sub-lethal"" effects on fish and marine mammals but it was ""unlikely that an accidental oil spill would occur from the proposed activities.""[28]
As Senator, and while running for president, Barack Obama received a total of $77,051 from BP[29] and has taken more money from BP's Political Action Committee and individuals connected with BP over the past 20 years than any other candidate, according to FEC disclosure records.[30] Likewise, the independent watchdog Center for Responsive Politics noted, ""the “top recipient of BP-related donations during the 2008 cycle was President Barack Obama himself.”[31][32]

 Obama approved drilling permits for BP without the statutory requirement to file an environmental impact assessment,[33] the handling of spills in a worst-case scenario,[34] and fostered a cozy relationship between government and the oil industry.[35] No other candidate took more money from BP in the past two decades than Obama received in only six years.[36]
Talk show personality Ed Schultz of MSNBC reiterated a call for campaign finance reform as a result of Barack Obama's ties to BP and the government's response.[37]
Transocean, owner of the Deepwater Horizons drilling rig leased to BP, was the recipient of the Obama Mineral Management Service's, Safety Award for Excellence.[38][39] On 30 April 2010 Transocean's stock fell after President Obama’s chief strategist, David Axelrod, made comments nine days into the disaster and the government raised estimates to more than fives times of what had previously been reported about how much oil was leaking into the Gulf of Mexico.[40]
It has been reported in the financial press that among owners of BP[41] are 

New Jersey Division of Investment (51 million shares)
California Public Employees Retirement System (36 million shares)
Pennsylvania Public School Employees Retirement System (7.1 million shares)
Teachers Retirement System of Alabama (4.5 million shares)
Employees Retirement System of Texas (4.1 million shares)
Ohio Public Employees Retirement System (1.1 million shares)
Illinois State Board of Investment (1.1 million shares)[42]
Indiana Public Employees' Retirement Fund (0.7 million shares)
Washington State Investment Board (1.2 million shares)
United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (21.9 million shares). 
BP was found wilfully negligent during the Bush administration in a Texas refinery explosion incident, and was assessed $108 million in fines - the highest workplace safety fines in U.S. history.[43]

Nalco and Corexit
 Dermatitis is one immediate health concern[44] of the Obama administration's decision to use toxic substances to disperse the visibility of the spill.  [4] Residents, cleanup workers, and tourists alike may be affected. [5]
Nalco of Naperville, Illinois formed a joint venture with Exxon Chemical in 1994 and the company's current leadership includes several executives from BP. Nalco reported it sold in excess of $40 million to BP of its dispersant, Corexit, shortly after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster.
Of 18 dispersants approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 12 were found to be more effective on southern Louisiana crude than Corexit, EPA data show.[45] Two of the 12 were found to be 100 percent effective on Gulf of Mexico crude, whereas two Corexit products rated only 56 percent and 63 percent effective.[46] The toxicity of the other 12 was shown to be in some cases 10 or 20 times less than Corexit, according to the EPA.[47] ""It's a chemical that the oil industry makes to sell to itself, basically,"" said Richard Charter, a senior policy adviser for Defenders of Wildlife.[48]
Corexit was found to be one of the most toxic dispersal agents ever developed.[49] With seasonal warming of water temperature the toxicity grows.  Corexit is banned in the United Kingdom due to environmental concerns.[50] The Obama EPA gave BP the green light to apply Corexit to the spill.[51]  At the Congressional hearing investigating the Gulf oil spill disaster, Democratic Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York raised the prospect of ""thousands and thousands of people getting sick or dying"" as a result of the administration's sanctioned use of the dispersant.[52] Critics allege use of dispersants like Corexit are largely for cosmetic purposes. Nalco has been a frequent contributor to the campaign of Sen. Mary Landrieu[53] of Louisiana.[54]

Deepwater Horizon
 Fire boat response crews battle the blazing remnants of the off shore oil rig Deepwater Horizon, April 21, 2010 (U.S. Coast Guard)
On Earth Day 2010, a BP-leased oil drilling rig sank to the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico two days after it exploded, creating what has been described as the ""worst environmental disaster in US history.""[55] Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar told CNN ""It potentially is catastrophic,"" and ""I think we have to prepare for the worst.""[56][57]
Congressional investigators think they have identified the rigs blowout preventer as the cause of the explosion.[58] The blowout preventer was leaking hydraulic fluid, had a dead battery,[59] and was inspected by the Obama Minerals Management Service (MMS) only two weeks before to the explosion[60] which killed 11 people. Amy Goodman, a leftist radio talk show host, has suggested those responsible should be prosecuted for manslaughter.[61]
Blowout preventers are meant to shut off the well, and the last line of defense is a set of shear rams which cut the pipe and seal off the well.[62] The MMS, the Obama administration agency that regulates offshore drilling along with the Coast Guard, is supposed to require  proof that shear rams are powerful enough to shut the well. Michael Saucier, MMS's regional supervisor testified before Congress that the MMS did not require BP to file a ""scenario for potential blowout.""[63] The MMS certified that BP ""has the capacity to respond, to the maximum extent practicable, to a worst-case discharge, or a substantial threat of such a discharge.""[64]
A May 2010 Inspector General's report revealed at least two MMS regulatory inspectors admitted to being under the influence of the illegal drug methamphetamine while on the job.[65][66]

Environmental disaster
 Projections of the flow of the spill over the summer of 2010. [6]
On 29 April 2010 oil began washing ashore in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana; four weeks later local leaders still were begging President Obama for federal assistance in responding to the disaster which was overtaking hundreds of miles of shoreline.[67]
Crude oil has washed into marshes, estuaries and onto beaches in Mississippi and Alabama. Wildlife has been killed and efforts are underway to save oil-coated
birds. Without capping the well Florida's Everglades may be turned into a ""dead zone."" Scientists expect currents to carry the oil slick to the eastern seaboard of the United States, fouling beaches and estuaries like the Chesapeake Bay and fishing grounds of the Grand Banks off Newfoundland.

Silverfish
Most scientists agree that Corexit 9500 will have a much larger biological effect when it reaches coastal areas teeming with wildlife.[68]  Many species are being threatened at a crucial time in their life cycle.[69] In testing done by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency the dispersant Corexit 9500 was found to be extremely lethal to silverfish, a benchmark organism in toxicity testing.[70]

Gulf menhaden
Gulf menhaden are a species harvested mostly for fish meal and fish oil. Menhaden could be badly affected
by the spill.

Coral, oyster and shrimp
Corals, oyster and shrimp likewise are critically affected. Richard Charter, a foremost expert on marine biology and oil spills who is a senior policy advisor for Marine Programmes for Defenders of Wildlife and is chairman of the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary Advisory Council has said, “There is a chemical toxicity to the dispersant compound that in many ways is worse than oil,” which ""in so doing you may be more seriously damaging the ecosystem offshore.”[71] Shrimp were found to be extremely vulnerable to the lethal effects of the chemical dispersant Corexit 9500 used by Obama administration disaster relief agencies and BP in testing done by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).[72]

Brown pelican
 Dead birds and sea turtles.
The Louisiana state bird, the Brown Pelican, was removed from protection under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 2009. The Obama administration approved BP's Deepwater Horizon drilling rig without the proper environmental impact assessment (EIA) required by law. The disaster occurred just as breeding season commenced.

Other bird species
Other species endangered by the oil spill are American oystercatcher and Wilson's plover.

Sea turtles
As several species of sea turtles move through the Gulf during their spring nesting season, they need to surface to breathe.

Toxic oil spill rain
A report prepared by the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources warned that the leaking crude oil into  the Gulf of Mexico is about to become the worst environmental catastrophe in all of human history, threatening the entire eastern half of North America with “total destruction.” Russian scientists based the assessment on the use of millions of gallons of the government approved chemical dispersant Corexit. 
The Russian scientists outlined that Corexit, with its 2.61ppm toxicity level,  combined with the seasonal warming of Gulf of Mexico waters, the molecules will be able to “phase transition” from their present liquid to a gaseous state allowing them to be absorbed into clouds and released as “toxic rain” upon all of Eastern North America.
The scientists warned should a Hurricane Katrina like storm form in the Gulf while tens of millions of gallons of Corexit are floating on or near the surface, the resulting “toxic rain” falling upon the North American continent could “theoretically” destroy all microbial life to any depth it reaches resulting in an “unimaginable environmental catastrophe” destroying all kinds of life forms.[73]

The response
Initially Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Coast Guard reported on 23 April 2010 there was no leak from the sunken oil rig.[74] The next day the Obama administration officially estimated a leak from the sunken well at 1000 barrels per day.[75] The Associated Press reported it took nine days after the explosion and the tragic loss of 11 workers lives before Obama made public commenta and acknowledged the disaster[76] and appointed a national incident commander.[77]
BP's stock fell[78] on news of the ""the worsening oil spill. "" Administration estimates were raised to 5000 barrels per day.[79]

U.S. Government dumps toxic dispersants into the Gulf of Mexico
 After President Obama's approval of the Deepwater Horizon's drilling rig permit and regulatory failures costing 11 workers their lives, the flow of oil into the Gulf of Mexico continued unabated for 86 days.
Wired Science reports the Obama administration disaster-relief agencies are using a toxic chemical to disperse oil in the Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster. Use of dispersants are said to be a public relations strategy.[80] Secretary Janet Napolitano of the Department of Homeland Security acknowledged[81] the U.S government was dumping toxic chemicals from C-130 cargo aircraft onto the spill.[82] Jackie Savitz of the ocean-conservation group Oceana stated the use of dispersants is only slightly less horrendous than the Gulf oil spill itself. ""You're basically pouring chemicals into the ocean, which is never a good thing.""[83] According to a 2009 Environmental Protection Agency report dispersants have not been used in the United State prior to the Obama administration's approval at BP'S request ""because of possible long-term environmental effects, difficulties with timely and effective application, disagreement among scientists and research data about their environmental effects, effectiveness, and toxicity concerns"" and the effects ""are still unknown.""[84] Residents in areas close to the oil spill have reported odors and symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, nausea, eye irritation, and respiratory problems.[85]

Disregard for worker safety
 Cleanup workers exposed to the Obama adminsitration's decision to use known toxic substances to disperse the spill. Critics allege dispersants are ineffective and largely for cosmetic purposes.
The Guardian (uk) has reported the controversy over Corexit exposes the Obama administration to criticism that its scientific agencies have been too accommodating to BP's strategy. In addition to the use of Corexit, the Obama Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) came under fire for withholding test results on the toxicity of the water close to shore.[86]
The dispersant 2-BE is known to cause heath dangers to clean up workers[87] and wildlife alike.[88] 2-BE has been documented to cause the breakdown of red blood cells, leading to blood in  urine and feces, and can damage the kidneys, liver, spleen and bone marrow of humans – effects not included on the information sheet for workers.[89] The dispersant Corexit 9500 is associated with headaches, vomiting and reproductive problems as sides effects to clean-up workers.[90] Lawrence Duffy of the University of Alaska claims dispersants ""are more a public relations measure than a preventive one. It has an effect on our psychology because we don't see the oil slick,""[91] though oil particles continue to do damage.[92]

Government mismanagement of relief efforts
Three weeks into the disaster National Public Radio reported the Obama administration's official figures were still grossly underestimated[93] and after the first month it was finally admitted the spill was nearly three times larger than earlier thought.[94]
Federal officials did not begin burning the leaking oil off the surface of the water until one full week after the rig collapsed.[95] Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal criticized President Obama for his slow response.[96] The New York Times castigated the White House for delays and not moving quick enough, calling the evidence ""damning"" and declaring the Gulf oil spill a ""huge disaster whose consequences might have been minimized with swifter action"" from the Obama administration.[97] One month into the spill, Democratic stalwarts James Carville,[98] Chris Matthews,[99] and Donna Brazile[100] criticized the inept and bungled response to the spreading catastrophe.

 Chris Oynes (left) of the Mineral Management Service presents Keelan Adamson (right) of Transocean the MMS's, Safety Award for Excellence (SAFE),[101] at the MMS National Award luncheon, 7 May 2009.[102]Source: Beacon magazine
The White House lacked any type of plan to combat the disaster. House Democratic Majority Leader Steny Hoyer publicly admitted that the Obama Administration was ill-prepared to deal with the situation.[103]  While the disaster steadily grew, Obama did not discuss the crisis at length until he appeared at a photo op at Venice, Louisiana on 3 May 2010.[104]   He would order a moratorium on all future deep sea oil platforms until they determine the problems associated with the current situation. As to be expected, Obama tries to remove himself from blame saying ""the system failed"", this despite the fact the he heads the system. Then he pointed fingers of blame at oil companies while taking an indirect jab at the Bush administration.[105]



 “

 For too long, for a decade or more, there has been a cozy relationship between the oil companies and the federal agency that permits them to drill. It seems as if permits were too often issued based on little more than assurances of safety from the oil companies. That cannot and will not happen anymore.

 ”


White House spokesman Robert Gibbs did his best to put a good spin on the disaster claiming the response was ""comprehensive and fast.""  Meanwhile, the Democrat-led Congress ordered public hearings from oil executives. President Obama blamed others saying the answers from oil executives were a ""ridiculous spectacle,"" ""You had executives of BP and Transocean and Halliburton falling over each other to point the finger of blame at somebody else."" [106] As the disaster progressed and questions arose over the government's misreporting and withholding[107] of information from the public about the true dimensions of the calamity, the Associated Press noted, 



 “

 First [Obama] was going to make BP pay for the Gulf oil mess. Then he declared himself in charge. Now he's trying to find out 'whose ass to kick' and making clear he'd fire BP's chief if only he could.[108]

Revitalizing cap and trade energy tax
Main article: Cap and trade
President Obama has been roundly criticized by Democrats and Republicans alike for attempting to use the national tragedy to revitalized his failed Cap and Trade energy proposals. The Obama proposal, widely perceived as a job-killer tax increase, has stalled in the U.S. Senate. California Senator Dianne Feinstein has stated the climate bill ""isn't going to stop the oil leak.""[109]
Environmentalists want the President to push the program. Fred Krupp of the Environmental Defense Fund calls the opportunity ""a political moment"" to pass a carbon tax estimated to cost the average U.S. household $4300 per year.[110]
Joel Benenson, who conducted polling for Obama’s presidential campaign, thinks the tax increase could pass, but wary Senate Democrats say otherwise. “There’s not a great call for it"" said West Virginia Democratic Senator Jay Rockefeller. “It’s unrelated” to the immediate crisis in the Gulf noted Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat from Nebraska.[111]


Assistance of foreign governments
Nearly two-months after the disaster took place, the Obama administration decides to utilize the assistance offered by 17 countries, the U.N and the European Union.[112] International aid offers already accepted include two skimmers and 2.6 miles (4.2 kilometers) of boom from Mexico, three sets of sweeping arm systems from the Netherlands and 1.86 miles (3.0 kilometers) of boom from Canada, the State Department said. The State Department noted that it has assisted BP in directly sourcing equipment and technical experts from around the world, including from Algeria, Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Latvia, Norway, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom.[113]

Public relations offensive
Faced with declining poll numbers and a public relations calamity, President Obama took to the airwaves nearly 60 days into the spill. A New York Times Op-ed commented,



 “

 All we got from President Obama was a vague call for some sort of new energy policy. Plus a Gulf Coast Restoration Plan, an oil spill study commission, a reminder that the secretary of energy won a Nobel Prize in physics and 17 references to God, prayer, blessings or faith.[114][115]

 ”


Former speechwriter for President Jimmy Carter, Chris Matthews, chided the President after his address to the nation,



 “

 Ludicrous that he keeps saying [Secretary of Energy] Chu has a Nobel prize. I'll barf if he does it one more time.[116]

 ”


Misrepresentation of evidence
Drilling moratorium based on junk science
The Washington Post reported in November 2010 the oil spill that damaged the Gulf of Mexico's reefs and wetlands also threatens to stain the Obama administration's reputation for relying on science to guide policy. The Department of Interior's concluded that the White House edited a drilling safety report in a way that made it falsely appear that scientists and experts backed the administration's six-month moratorium on new deep-water drilling. The editing changes by the White House resulted ""in the implication that the moratorium recommendation had been peer reviewed."" But it hadn't been. Outside scientists were asked only to review new safety measures for offshore drilling.[117]
In October 2010 the Presidential Oil Spill Commission said that the White House Office of Management and Budget delayed publication of a scientific report that forecast how much oil could reach the gulf's shores. The report said that President Obama's energy adviser and Socialist International operative Carol Browner,[118] mischaracterized on national TV a government analysis about where the oil went, saying it showed most of the oil was ""gone."" It also said Browner and the head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Jane Lubchenco, contributed to the public's perception that the report was more exact than it was.
Academics, environmentalists and federal investigators have accused the administration since the April 2010 spill of downplaying scientific findings, misrepresenting data and misconstruing the opinions of experts it solicited.[119]

Economic impacts
 Oil slick map as of May 30, 2010.
The economic impact of the Gulf of Mexico oil drilling disaster will be large and devastating to several key industries, including fishing, tourism, and transportation.[120]
The top commercial species in terms of value are shrimp ($367 million), menhaden ($64 million), oysters ($59 million), and blue crab ($38 million).[121] As of 25 May 2010, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) closed 54,096 square miles to commercial and recreational fishing.[122] These areas are some of the richest fishing grounds in the Gulf of Mexico for major commercial species such as white shrimp, blue crab, and oysters.

Employment in fishing
The most immediate economic impact of the oil spill has been on the Gulf fishing[123] industry. The number of jobs at stake, which includes seafood processing and related wholesale and retail, is over 200,000 with related economic activity of $5.5 billion.[124]
Dockside sales in Louisiana are approximately $660 million.[125] Loses to the Louisiana fishing could  be as high as $2.5 billion.[126]

Employment in tourism
The tourist industry employs 620,000 people who earn over $9 billion in wages in the Gulf of Mexico region. Analysts say Florida alone could lose $3 billion in tourism.[127]
In 2008, recreational anglers took 25.4 million fishing trips and spent over $12 billion on equipment and trips in the Gulf region.[128] Some of the most popular recreational species include snappers, several types of drum, sheepshead, and Spanish mackerel. Recreational fisheries support businesses such as charters, bait and tackle, and services such as restaurants and hotels. 
In 2000, 21.9 million people visited Gulf beaches and accounted for 177.2 million beach days.[129]

Transportation
The Offshore Marine Service Association (OMSA),[130] the national trade association for U.S. flag vessels in the energy sector, criticized the Obama administration's moratorium on offshore drilling projects. 100,000 jobs were immediately affected by the president's decision as companies began cancelling contracts to carry supplies, forcing layoffs. ""The industry has struggled to climb out of a severe economic downturn. The moratorium threatens any hope of recovery and creates the potential for economic hardship that could last a decade or longer,"" remarked OMSA President Ken Wells.
OMSA estimates that for every mariner who works on board a vessel, there are nine other Americans working in shore-side jobs that support vessel operations. Beyond the vessel crew, the negative consequences of the moratorium could impact everyone from service technicians supporting everything from diesel engines to the air condition systems to the local grocer who supplies food for the boat's galley.
Offshore vessels are a major part of the tax base in many coastal communities. Gulf Coast state and local government revenues will also decrease due to lower income tax and sales tax collections.
Disruption of shipping traffic in and out of the Port of New Orleans will impact barge, container, and tanker traffic in the Mississippi Delta and along the Mississippi River.  Prices of all types of commodities would affected.

Insurance industry
BP, the operator on the oil drilling lease with a 65% stake, insured itself, rather than buying coverage from insurance companies. Industry analysts estimate total costs related to the oil spill cleanup and damages could exceed $14 billion.[131]

Lost revenue to state and local governments
Louisiana
A Greater New Orleans study indicates the Obama administration's moratorium could cost Louisiana as many as 22,000 jobs and more than $782 million in revenues.
With the average deepwater rig employing 230 workers with an average salary of $98,000, the study puts the tax revenue impact at $151 million if drilling were to resume within 18 months. Greater New Orleans President and CEO Michael Hecht says it’s difficult to be optimistic based on President Obama’s Oval Office address on 15 June 2010. President Obama's action “has the potential to turn an ecological tragedy into an economic calamity,” Hecht said.[132] The study foresees in a worse case scenario the loss of more than 22,000 jobs, 3,450 of them directly tied to the operating rigs and 18,945 with indirect ties such as catering firms and other companies that serve U.S energy producers.
Fearing that the drilling moratorium ""could exacerbate, rather than alleviate, the impacts of this spill upon both our economy and our environment,"" U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu wrote to President Obama on 11 June 2010.[133] Landrieu stated, 



 “

 more than 300,000 Louisianians are employed either directly or indirectly by the oil and gas industry. ..The immediate impacts to the economy are devastating enough: idling the 33 rigs currently permitted to drill in the deepwater Gulf would immediately impact employment for roughly 38,000 crewmen, deck hands, engineers, welders, ROV operators, caterers, helicopter pilots, and others who operate and service these vessels. That's like closing 12 large motor vehicle assembly plants in one state, all at once.

 ”


Lost state and local tax revenues will accrue at a rate between $8 million and $15 million a month. Federal royalty losses will be substantial and a significant drop in tolls collected for the Louisiana Highway 1 bridge at Leeville, the main artery to the Port Fourchon energy port is projected as well.

Texas
The Texas state comptroller’s office reported collection of $2.3 billion in oil and natural gas production taxes in fiscal year 2009 and $4.1 billion in 2008. The tax revenue is used to repair roads and fund schools, among other state services. Although no official analysis of President Obama's decision to place a moratorium on offshore production has been compiled yet, the Texas comptroller’s office said it’s unclear how much of an impact the president's decision will have on state services. Experts warn the president's decision could threaten tens of thousands of jobs in the Houston area.[134]

Alabama
Manufacturing jobs in Alabama are at risk as a result of President Obama's actions, as no new orders for equipment are coming in.[135]

Increased dependency on foreign oil
New Jersey Democrat Senator Robert Menendez proposed a ban on new offshore drilling permits and submitted a bill that would retroactively raise the financial liability of BP from $75 million to $10 billion.[136] Oklahoma Republican Senator James Inhofe successfully killed the bill saying it would reduce competition and shut down smaller independent oil companies in favor of larger companies.

Too big to fail
An oil industry trade publication[137] reports President Obama and senior White House staff, as well as Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, are working with BP on legislation that would raise the cap on liability for damage claims from those affected by the oil disaster from $75 million to $10 billion. However the disaster has the real potential of costing nearly $1 trillion. Critics point out that in the deal between Obama and BP, $10 billion is a drop in the bucket for a trillion dollar disaster. Talk is noted in government circles, including FEMA, of the need to nationalize BP in order to compensate those who will ultimately be affected by the worst oil disaster in the history of the world, and BP would, if its assets were nationalized, be credited with almost a trillion dollars for compensation purposes.[138][139]
After Obama charged Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate the disaster, BP establish a $20 billion extrajudicial fund managed by an Obama appointee.[140] Former CNN news writer and radio talk show host Mike Malloy suggested Holder is beholden to corporatist interests.[141]

Criticism of the Obama administration's handling of the disaster
 Memorial service for the 11 workers killed in the explosion.Reuters [8]
Former top adviser to President Bill Clinton, James Carville, turned visibly emotional in an interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC's Good Morning America over President Barack Obama's ""lackadaisical"" response to the Gulf oil spill disaster. 



 “

 The political stupidity is unbelievable. ... The President of the United States  could have come down here. He could have been involved with the families of these 11 people...... He could have implemented a plan in anticipation of this... He could be commandeering tankers and making BP bring tankers in and clean this up.... He could be deploying people to the coast. He could be with the corps of engineers and the Coast Guard with these people in Plaquemines Parish, doing something about these regulations. These people are crying. They're begging for something down here. And it just looks like he's not involved in this! Man, you have got to get down here and take control of this! Put somebody in charge of this and get this thing moving! We're about to die down here![142][143][144]

 ”


Carville also said in a separate interview on CNN with Anderson Cooper,



 “

 They are risking everything by this ‘go along with BP’ strategy they have. They seem, like, lackadaisical on this...they seem like they’re inconvenienced by this, this is some giant thing getting in their way and somehow or another, if you let BP handle it, it’ll all go away. It’s not going away. It’s growing out there. It is a disaster of the first magnitude...the government thinks that they are partnering with BP. I think they actually believe that BP has some kind of a good motivation here. That’s one of the, sort of, whole flaws is they're naïve.[145][146]

 ”


Obama acknowledged the criticism days later in a televised press conference:



 “

 Where I was wrong was in my belief that the oil companies had their act together when it came to worst-case scenarios.[147]

 ”


 Day 12 of the Disaster: Obama enjoys an evening of levity and banter with the Washington Press Corps at the White House Correspondent's Dinner.
MSNBC talk show host Chris Matthews[148] said on Jay Leno's Tonight Show,



 “

 The president scares me. He's been acting a little like a Vatican Observer here. When is he actually going to do something? And I worry. I know he doesn't want to take ownership of it. I know politics. He said the minute he says, 'I'm in charge,' he takes the blame.[149]

 ”


Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential campaign manager in 2008 questioned if Democratic primary voters had 



 “

 underestimated the value of experience and crisis management as important attributes for their president.[150]

 ”


Donna Brazile, who managed the presidential campaign of Democratic candidate Al Gore in 2000 said on ABC's This Week,



 “

 One of the problems I have with the administration is that they're not tough enough. They are waiting for BP to say, ‘oh, we've got a new plan to stop the oil leak.’ They need to stop it, contain it, clean it up, and try to help us conserve our coastal wetlands.[151]

 ”


Dick Morris, an intimate adviser to President Bill Clinton observed,



 “

 these failings show that Obama is in over his head. But to the left, which bleeds for each drop of water in the gulf and cries over every turtle or shrimp or sea bird, it is an unpardonable sin...Obama's incompetence and inexperience is causing liberals to see him as arrogant, aloof, removed, conceited, suspicious of outside advice and even lazy...these character defects will haunt the president until 2012 and beyond.[152]

 ”


David Gergen worked in the Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Clinton White House remarked,



 “

 If our government had fought WWII like the way we’re fighting the oil spill, there’s a good chance many of us would be speaking German today.[153]

 ”


Republican Chairman Michael Steele criticized the president for golfing while the oil crisis worsened.[154]



 “

 Until this problem is fixed, no more golf outings.

 ”


Peggy Noonan, a speech writer for President's Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, summed up public perceptions with,



 “

 The president, in my view, continues to govern in a way that suggests he is chronically detached from the central and immediate concerns of his countrymen.... he has not, almost from the day he was inaugurated, been in sync with the center....The American people have spent at least two years worrying that high government spending would, in the end, undo the republic. They saw the dollars gushing night and day...And now we have a videotape metaphor for all the public’s fears: the well gushing black oil into the Gulf of Mexico ...His philosophy is that it is appropriate for the federal government to occupy a more burly, significant and powerful place in America—confronting its problems of need, injustice, inequality. ... Then the oil spill came and government could not do the job, could not meet the need ...Katrina illustrate[d] that even though the federal government in our time has continually taken on new missions and responsibilities, the more it took on, the less it seemed capable of performing even its most essential jobs. Conservatives got this point—they know it without being told—but liberals and progressives did not. They thought Katrina was the result only of George W. Bush’s incompetence and conservatives’ failure to “believe in government.” But Mr. Obama was supposed to be competent....It’s not good to have a president in this position—weakened, polarizing and lacking broad public support—less than halfway through his term. That it is his fault is no comfort.[155]

 ”


New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd wrote,



 “

 Obama and top aides who believe in his divinity make a mistake to dismiss complaints of his aloofness as Washington white noise. He treats the press as a nuisance rather than examining his own inability to encapsulate Americans’ feelings.[156]

 ”


Actor Robert Redford demanded action from the Obama administration. The liberal special interest group Natural Resources Defense Council has Redford in a new ad decrying the lackluster response.[157] Redford made an appearance on MSNBC and said there is no one manning this ship,



 “

 In this case, we don’t need a disaster manager, we need a leader.

 ”


Liberal Hollywood director James Cameron says;



 “

 Over the last few weeks I've watched, as we all have, with growing horror and heartache, watching what's happening in the Gulf and thinking those morons don't know what they're doing.[158]

 ”


Obnoxious Hollywood liberal Rosie O'Donnell said, ""We broke the womb of freaking mother Earth.""  [159] In addition, O'Donnell accused BP of



 “

 willful homicide, willful mass murder"" and demanded BP be nationalized immediately: ""I say seize their assets. Right now. Seize their assets today. Take over the company.

 ”


Brad Pitt, appears in a Spike Lee film denouncing the oil spill and his desire to see BP executives get the death penalty.[160]


Foreign reaction
Relations between allies the U.K. and U.S. are now at historic lows thanks to Barack Obama's mishandling of the oil spill. Britain had been repeatedly mocked by Obama prior to the spill[161][162][163] but now find themselves subjected to endless propaganda. Prominent foreign dignitaries have expressed the public's growing frustration with the administration's posturing and hunt for scapegoats. The mayor of London, Boris Johnson, who supported Obama in 2008, decried ""anti-British rhetoric, buck-passing and name-calling"" while Lord Tebbit branded Mr Obama's conduct “despicable” and the president's rhetoric 



 “

 a crude, bigoted, xenophobic display of partisan political Presidential petulance.""[164][165]

 ”


The atmosphere Obama created in Britain is so toxic that the British press has labelled Barack Obama the most unpopular man in England.[166]

10mm Auto,https://www.conservapedia.com/10mm_Auto,"The 10mm Auto (10x25mm) is a cartridge for semi-automatic pistols, developed by firearms visionary Jeff Cooper and originally produced by ammunition manufacturer FFV Norma AB of Åmotfors, Sweden.
It was originally introduced in 1983 for the Bren Ten pistol, of Miami Vice fame.  That pistol was later followed by the Colt Dela Elite and the Glock 20.

Adoption and Rejection by the FBI
In the late 1980s, the FBI adopted the 10mm round in the S&W 1076 pistol.  This chambering was selected due to the Bureau's dissatisfaction with the performance of the .38 Special cartridge in the S&W revolver during the infamous 1986 Miami FBI shootout, in which special agents Gerald Dove and Benjamin Grogan were martyred by two criminals.
The FBI initially chose the 10mm Auto standard as being the most powerful then available for high-capacity semi-automatic handguns, with ammunition capable of exceeding 800 ft·lbf energy (doubling that of common 9mm rounds and handily exceeding the venerable .45 ACP). Shortly thereafter, the Bureau reversed its decision, switching instead to the .40 S&W cartridge, a round of the same 10mm diameter, but a shorter cartridge length (and less stopping power as a result of correspondingly reduced space for propellent in the cartridge).
The decision to change to the .40 S&W was caused by the inability of many FBI agents to cope with the recoil produced by a full-power combat cartridge. The length of the 10mm Auto cartridge necessitated a large frame handgun to accommodate the larger magazines and handle the stresses produced by the stronger round, meaning it was ill-suited to persons with small hands. At this point in the FBI's history, affirmative action programs had led to the hiring of a substantially different demographic than had been hired in the past. Further, many new recruits in the 1980s had generally been too young to have served in the Vietnam War, which combined with a general urbanization of the United States as well as politico-cultural pressures against legal firearms ownership, left the FBI with a pool of candidates unfamiliar with and uncomfortable with firearms.  Accordingly, a change was made to a less-powerful cartridge that could be easily handled by the average recruit.  
FBI statistics do not indicate how many shootings have failed to stop a suspect due to the usage of a reduced power cartridge.

Resurgence in popularity
The 10mm Auto languished in relative obscurity after FBI rejection as well as the paucity of civilian handgun offerings available (the Bren Ten having a troublesome history and with a production run of only 1,500). But interest was revived with the introduction of the Glock 20 in 1991, and increased considerable with the reintroduction of the Delta Elite (a 10mm variant of 1911 design) in 2009 and the Generation 4 Clock 29 in 2010. Coming with three 15-round magazines, the Glock 20 set the a high bar for other manufacturers.
The 10mm is considered to possess adequate stopping for all North American wild animal threats, including brown bear (although care should be taken in choosing ammunition for that purpose, as heavier hard-cast loads are recommended over hollow-point personal defense rounds). After-market barrel and spring replacements (for the Glock 20's stock polygonal barrel and spring) are offered by several third-party manufacturers for Glock customers seeking the fire heavier loads or reloads.
Those competing in tactical shooting competitions (IDPA, IPSC) sometimes use the S&W 610 10mm revolver, since the 10mm cartridges can be united by a single ""moon-clip"", giving the shooter a reloading speed advantage over the traditional revolver.

1

Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.

The philistines attacked Israel, and Israelites fled from them, and there were a lot of deaths in Mount Guilboa.




2

And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.

The philistines pursued Saul and his sons, and they murdered Jonathan, Abinadab and Malquisua.




3

And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded of the archers.

Then they focused all their attacks on Saul, and the archers managed to hurt him with their arrows.




4

Then said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.

Then he told to his squire: “Take out your sword and kill me with it, so this atheists don’t come and have fun with me.” But his squire failed to obey the order, because he lacked machismo. Then Saul took his sword and let himself fall over it.




5

And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and died.

And when his squire saw that Saul was dead, he also committed suicide.




6

So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together.

That day Saul, his three sons and all his family died.




7

And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.

And when the Israelites that lived in the valley saw that the rest had fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned the cities and fled also. Then the philistines came and stayed to live in them.




8

And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa.

The next day, when the philistines came to loot the deaths, they found Saul and his sons lying in Mount Guilboa




9

And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people.

Then they took off his clothes, took his head and his weapons, and sent messengers through all the philistine territory to give the news to their people and their idols.




10

And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.

Then they put Saul weapons in the house of their idols, and hanged his head in the temple of Dagon.




11

And when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,

When all Jabesh-gilead found out what the philistines had done with Saul




12

They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.

All brave men agreed to take the bodies of Saul and his sons and took them to Jabesh. There they buried his remains under an oak. After that, they kept seven days of fast.




13

So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD, even against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to inquire of it;

This is how Saul died due to his disobedience to God, he even consulted a fortune teller instead of consulting Him.




14

And inquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.

That is why God took his life and gave the kingdom to David, son of Jesse.

1790 Copyright Act,https://www.conservapedia.com/1790_Copyright_Act,"The 1790 Copyright Act was the first copyright statute in the United States. It provided a federal copyright term of 14 years from the date of publication, renewable for an additional 14 years if the author survived the first term.[1]
The 1790 Act's renewable 14-year term applied to existing works (i.e., works already published and works created but not yet published) and future works alike.[2] Congress expanded the federal copyright term to 42 years in 1831 (28 years from publication, renewable for an additional 14 years), and then to 56 years in 1909 (28 years from publication, renewable for an additional 28 years).[3]  Both times, Congress applied the new copyright term to existing and future works;[4] to qualify for the 1831 extension, an existing work had to be in its initial copyright term at the time the Act became effective.[5]
In 1976, Congress altered the method for computing federal copyright terms.[6]  For works created by identified natural persons, the 1976 Act provided that federal copyright protection would run from the work's creation, not—as in the 1790, 1831, and 1909 Acts—its publication; protection would last until 50 years after the author's death.[7]  In these respects, the 1976 Act aligned United States copyright terms with the then-dominant international standard adopted under the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.[8]  For anonymous works, pseudonymous works, and works made for hire, the 1976 Act provided a term of 75 years from publication or 100 years from creation, whichever expired first.[9]
These new copyright terms, the 1976 Act instructed, governed all works not published by its effective date of January 1, 1978, regardless of when the works were created.[10]  For published works with existing copyrights as of that date, the 1976 Act granted a copyright term of 75 years from the date of publication, § 304(a) and (b), a 19-year increase over the 56-year term applicable under the 1909 Act.

2000 Presidential Election,https://www.conservapedia.com/2000_Presidential_Election," George W. Bush and Al Gore In 2000, the United States presidential election was one of the closest and most controversial presidential elections in history. A month of recounts and court challenges followed, culminating in the Supreme Court case Bush v. Gore. Following the court's 5-4 decision, George W. Bush was declared the winner over Vice President Al Gore by 537 votes in the state of Florida. Domestic issues as opposed to foreign policy dominated the campaign. Key issues were prescription drug prices, campaign finance reform, Social Security, and education. Each candidate claimed their economic plan would reduce the deficit. Bush parodied himself as a ""compassionate conservative."" The Bush campaign did not make an issue over the sex scandal and impeachment of Bill Clinton's Presidency less than two years ago. Gore refused to allow Clinton to campaign and did not himself campaign on the Administration's record of peace and prosperity, and disappointed Democrats by his lackluster performance.

Primaries
The contest for the Republican nomination came down to two men: Texas Governor George W. Bush and Arizona Senator John McCain, an ex-POW in North Vietnam. Most Republican leaders endorsed Bush, who was popular with social conservatives. Despite early victories for McCain in the New Hampshire and Michigan primaries, Bush went on to win South Carolina and 9 out of 13 super Tuesday states. McCain dropped out in March after a bitter primary.
Incumbent Vice President Al Gore faced a challenge from former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley. Bradly ran to left of Gore on universal health care, gun control, and campaign finance reform. Gore eventually trumped Bradly, winning all 50 primary states.  

Campaign
As a Vice President for eight years to a popular President during a time when the economy was still believed to be doing well, Gore appeared to have some strong starting advantages.  Indeed, he easily won the Democratic primary.  But due to Clinton's scandal and impeachment in 1998, Gore sought to distance himself from the sitting President.  Clinton, for his part, did little to help Gore.  Indeed, when Clinton gave his big speech where he was supposed to pass the baton to Gore, he could never quite do so - instead talking about his own accomplishments and saying little more than 'and Al Gore was there too'.  During the campaign political pundits stressed the need of Gore to show that he was the 'alpha dog', but he never quite achieved that breakthrough and it would 'dog' him throughout his campaign.  Gore tried to find a balance between adopting the economy and yet steering clear of Clinton's moral failings, but could never quite find the right mix.  He was also hampered by the public perception that the economy under Clinton was due more to good fortune than any Clinton initiatives.  With Republicans controlling Congress for the last 6 years of Clinton's terms, there was a view that Clinton's role was one of not doing anything to stop the expansion more than doing something to cause it. 
Bush also came out of the Republican primary relatively unscathed, and had a 'pedigree' of being the son of a previous President and a strong record as governor of Texas and being well liked by the Latino  populace, a group that Republicans had struggled to vote their way.  The press began to attack Bush and his speaking style where he had a tendency to sometimes mispronounce or garble words.  

Debates
The two candidates had a series of three debates.  Gore, a seasoned Ivy league debater, was declared the winner by the press and 'ivory tower' pundits in each of the debates—even as Bush's poll numbers increased.  Bush's speaking style, while causing disgust to the elites, played well in middle America who considered him real.  Also, the downgrading of Bush's intellect within the press before the debates led Bush to easily exceed expectations.  Gore also confounded himself, as he showed a different style in each of the debates leading the American people to wonder who he was.  It was especially apparent in the last debate, when, after hearing that he didn't attack enough in the previous debates, Gore actually walked over to where Bush was while Bush was giving an answer and started to question him.  Bush gave a quick retort and Gore continued to ask more questions.  Bush finally turned to the moderator who restored order.  The press was ecstatic after the debate saying that Bush had to cry out to be saved, but the American people had a different view of such blatant breaking the rules and Bush's numbers continued to increase.

Last minute surprise
While Gore had enjoyed a lead through much of the campaign, a few days before the election Bush's bounce from the debates was enough to put him in the lead by a small margin.  It was then that a ""surprise"" was dropped that Bush had a DUI in 1976, over two decades ago.[1]  Blasted on the airwaves continuously before the election itself and with little time to defend it, undecided voters in the last days went heavily for Gore and actually gave him a plurality of the popular vote.

The Palm Beach ""Butterfly Ballot""
One of the potential keys to Gore losing Florida was the unusual style of paper ballot used in Palm Beach County, a South Florida county which has a large Jewish population and is historically a Democratic stronghold.
The ballot style required voters to choose their choice for President/Vice President by punching paper ballots; however, instead of listing all the candidates on one side, the candidates were listed on alternating sides of the ballot (in larger print to assist the large number of elderly voters; the alternating list gave rise to the ""butterfly ballot"" nickname).  The top of the line showing ""Gore-Lieberman"", however, overlapped with the ballot punch hole for the Reform Party ticket of ""Pat Buchanan-Ezola Foster""; notwithstanding a clearly-marked arrow directing voters to the correct punch hole, Buchanan (considered by many a notorious anti-Semite) received an unusually high number of votes in a county with a sizeable Jewish population.

The Networks rush to be wrong
The networks, in a rush to be the first to present results, made false calls in Florida. Each  network used the same exit poll data, which contained a small math error for Florida.  The networks first called Florida for Gore, then for Bush. They should have said it was too close to call.  Worse (and some believe, deliberately), the networks called Florida after the polls closed in the Eastern Time Zone part of the state (which is heavily Democratic) but while they were still open in the Central Time Zone part (the Florida panhandle, which is heavily Republican due to the large military bases located there).
In a rare situation in Presidential elections, Al Gore lost his home state of Tennessee to George Bush.  Had he carried that state, the whole question of how Florida voted would have been moot.

Recount
This was the 16th time in history that a candidate won the Electoral College vote without receiving the majority of the nation's popular vote.[2]
The final official recount in Florida showed Bush the winner by 537 votes.  Gore supporters asked the Florida state Supreme Court to again recount votes in some counties where they thought Gore might add votes, but to ignore counties where they thought Bush would gain.  The U.S. Supreme Court ruled this strategy illegal, and the result was accepted by Gore, who indeed announced the Florida vote for Bush in his role as Vice President.

 
The campaigns of both Ralph Nader on the Green Party ticket and Pat Buchanan on the Reform Party ticket gained some media attention during the campaign. With the election so close people speculated that they had ""caused"" the result. Democrats never forgave Nader.
There has also been much speculation on what might have happened if there had been recounts under different rules. A consortium of newspapers did an investigation of multiple scenarios. They concluded Gore would have won in some versions and Bush in other versions; ironically, Bush would have won under the recounts that Gore had proposed. 
The Election Results eventually showed[3]

Aftermath
Unknown to the voting public at the time, the economy had already begun a steep decline before the election.  The uncertainty over who would be President and the court battle that ensued caused a steep drop in the stock market leading to the loss of 5 trillion dollars of equity on paper.  Such a huge loss would start the next Presidency in a very difficult situation economically and would only be compounded with the complete breaking of the dot-com bubble.

"""Democratic Socialist""",https://www.conservapedia.com/%22Democratic_Socialist%22,"For the activist organization, see Democratic Socialists of America
Democratic Socialism is a socialist organization run as a meritocracy. It is highly organized and strictly exclusionary of non-members.
Democratic Socialism is less of an ideology and more of a highly organized machine of people committed to action. To the extent it can be said it has an ideology, it opposes ""dictatorship"" of a single person in favor of a collective dictatorship by a Politburo that extends democratic rights to ruling Socialist party members, and denies the democratic rights of non-party members and common people. 
It allows citizenship rights of party members, and  provides a pathway for career advancement through party elections to positions of ""collective leadership.""  The Red Rose is the symbol used by democratic socialists world wide.
Although members respect each other as equals with ""democratic"" rights, each member has a rank, position, and duty to fulfill. Non-members are the matter or subjects to be acted upon or against, whose civil, constitutional, and human rights impair the mission of establishing and maintaining socialist order.
Democratic Socialist regimes arose after the death of dictator-for-life Mao Zedong in China and Fidel Castro in Cuba, now governed as corrupt technocracies by elitists.
An agreed upon definition of Democratic Socialism ideology remains controversial. Marxist dialectic rebranding of labels for themselves and their targets has generated much confusion and contradictions in many historical narratives. However, definitions generally fall into three overall groups: (1) used by Lenin's leftwing opponents; (2) what North Korea calls itself; and (3) what Bernie Sanders and many members of the Democratic Party call themselves. Some supporters of Democratic Socialism also deny that it is a form of socialism to opponents of that ideology.

What it is
Voting rights only accrue to party members, and party membership is only granted after years of rigorous ideological indoctrination and training. Theoretically, under Democratic Socialism, one need not gain power by murdering party rivals or cronyism; one must gain the confidence of fellow members as a successful manager among policy wonks and technocrats. 
Despite the fact that Democratic Socialism supposedly counters a single-person dictatorship, its policies of expansive government involvement in peoples lives, massive regulations, and a strong association with secularism and social liberalism, makes it indistinguishable from communism and Progressivism. They all advocate statism and single-party control by a technocratic bureaucracy.
In the modern era, Democratic Socialism is the realization of Mikhail Gorbachev's failed attempt at Perestroika – a restructuring of socialist party power and privileges while denying equal rights, power sharing, and a choice of political parties to the masses.
Emerging Democratic socialist counties in the Global South include Venezuela and Bolivia (although the former and sometimes the latter are considered dictatorships by many in the American mainstream, it is not known whether this is because of human rights abuses or just an ideological disagreement).
Only power elites vote in a Democratic Socialist system. It's an ideology that is in opposition to the American form of government.

""internal democracy""
The Democratic Socialists of America are a case study. In 2016, membership tripled. But the DSA is unlike other political parties. The DSA in 2019 struggles to manage its explosive growth at the local level while allowing for ""internal democracy.""[1] In local Republican and Democratic precinct caucuses it's not uncommon for a church or labor union to take over a delegation to county, district, and state conventions. These churches or labor unions may have a specific agenda not supported by the state or national party. That's how grassroots democracy in America works. 
The DSA is quite different. No individual or organized outside group can take over a local chapter; decisions, directives, and objectives come from on high, and members must conform to pre-fabricated Marxist theory as interpreted by the national leadership. In essence, members at the local level must submit to party brainwashing, and leave their personal causes and motivations at the door. Without this conformity, there are no voting rights within the party.

Contrast with Social Democracy

See also: Mixed economy
By contrast, some ""social democracy"" countries in the developed world include the Scandinavian countries and France. 
It has been claimed that social democracies—particularly the wealthy European countries—are happier than conservative, capitalist countries, but the polls[2] tell only part of the story.[3] The European socialist countries are in turmoil over issues such as unrestricted immigration, and right-wing parties, such as the Sweden Democrats, Danish People's Party, Austrian Freedom Party, Swiss People's Party, French National Front, among others, are growing dramatically.[4][5] In areas formerly dominated by the left and socialism, right-wing parties are growing dramatically.[6] In addition, the United States of America, which is much more Christian, conservative, and capitalist overall, is still ranked at number 13, despite the existence of inner city slums across the nation.[2]
Additionally, the wealth that exists in First World Countries leads to lower birth rates, a harmful side effect in a social democratic welfare state.[7]

Contrast with American civil service
In any Marxist state, all government jobs are held by socialist or Communist party members. From the Head of State to village librarian, from military officers, police officers to teachers and social workers.
By contrast, in the United States Civil Service System, government jobs are filled, theoretically, by ""merit"" without regard to party affiliation. Appointments are made to government jobs by qualifications, not by ideological indoctrination.
In a typical Marxist society, special schools are set up for the children of party members and students selected by teachers, ages four to fourteen. Separated from the mass of their peers, they are  rigidly infused with socialist theory as tomorrow's leaders,[8] and as a privileged few. These groups have been traditionally known as the Young Pioneers.
At fourteen, those who haven't washed out yet go on to join the party Youth Organization consisting of young people ages 14–28,[9] where the hope is in meeting a spouse. By age 28, full party membership and a good government civil service job is granted, replete with all party privileges and voting rights denied to the masses.

Cult-like behavior
Cult expert Margaret Thaler Singer writes:

Cults are defined by their methods and tactics, not their supposed beliefs. Cults and cult-like thinking always proliferate at times of great social upheaval, when people feel displaced.
Cults always serve a powerful elite, with recruits manipulated from above to profit those elites,[10] who employ coordinated persuasion programs.[11]
Cults always have a hidden agenda that is never exposed when recruiting.[12] They isolate their recruits from other points of view in order to control and manipulate them.
Cults control language in order to blunt independent thought. They cultivate dependency, debilitation, deception, dread of separation, and desensitization in people, all of which makes it harder for them to walk away.
The main goal of a cult is simply to grow, grow, grow. There is no end in sight in terms of recruitment or fundraising or power.
Cults make a point of getting footholds in the institutions of society — including government, media, and education — in order to get mainstream credibility.
Cults are very organized in suppressing critics and criticism.
Author Stella Morabito, an expert on Russian and Soviet media and propaganda, observes about cults: ""political correctness has a lot of disruptive effects on discourse, such as inducing self-censorship that can cause us to feel socially and mentally isolated; manipulation of our basic fear of ostracism through the threat of smears; promotion of mob rule; and an authoritarian nature that promotes the power elites who use it....This acceptance of the anti-thought nature of political correctness is pretty much everywhere: 95 percent of the mass media promote it, 95 percent of celebrity culture promotes it, and obviously, on college campuses, the academics are 95 percent in compliance with political correctness.
You can't deny cult-like tribunals against ""wrongthink"" are pretty much everywhere––in the media, in celebrity culture, in our legislatures, among judges, in human resource departments all over the corporate world, and most obviously, on college campuses, where youth are scared to death of being ostracized for expressing a politically incorrect thought....

When real debate happens, it gets shouted down or pushed into a corner of the internet dubbed the ""intellectual dark web."" Increasingly, our minds seem to be operating in a dangerous state of isolation, especially with increasing censorship and control over our conversations by mass media and tech titans... Americans seem to increasingly mimic many of the behaviors of cult recruits: self-censorship, peer-modeled behaviors, emotions ruling their sense of reason, obedience to the mob, and adulation of politically correct idols and celebrities....[13]

1

Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.

All the Israelites gathered together to speak with David in Hebron. There they told him: “We have the same blood as you”




2

And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel.

And, even though Saul was the king, you were the one who lead Israel in battle. Furthermore, God has promised that you will rule over the people of Israel.




3

Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.

The elders of Israel spoke with David in Hebron, and David made a deal with them, with God as witness. Then they named David the King of Israel, just as God had promised through Samuel.




4

And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.

David and the Israelites went to Jerusalem, which was inhabited by the Jebusites.




5

And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which is the city of David.

And they told David: “You are not welcome here”. However, David captured the fortress of Zion, which is now known as the City of David.




6

And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.

David said: The first one who attacks the Jebusites will be appointed chief and captain. And the first to attack was Joab, son of Zeruiah, and he was promoted to chief.




7

And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David.

David installed himself in the fortress, this is why it was called the City of David.




8

And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.

David built the city around the fortress, from the embankment to the suburbs. Joab rebuilt the rest of the city.




9

So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts was with him.

And the power of David was raising, and God was with him.




10

These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.






11

And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, and Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time.






12

And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighties.






13

He was with David at Pas-dammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.






14

And they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved them by a great deliverance.






15

Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.






16

And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison was then at Bethlehem.






17

And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate!






18

And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but poured it out to the LORD,






19

And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest.






20

And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew them, and had a name among the three.






21

Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their captain: howbeit he attained not to the first three.






22

Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.






23

And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.






24

These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties.






25

Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not to the first three: and David set him over his guard.






26

Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they were among the mighty men, helpers of the war.






2

They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow, even of Saul's brethren of Benjamin.






3

The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite,

And Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.






8

And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David into the hold to the wilderness men of might, and men of war fit for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose faces were like the faces of lions, and were as swift as the roes upon the mountains;

These were of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of the least was over an hundred, and the greatest over a thousand.






15

These are they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it had overflown all his banks; and they put to flight all them of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the west.






16

And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold unto David.






17

And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto them, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart shall be knit unto you: but if ye be come to betray me to mine enemies, seeing there is no wrong in mine hands, the God of our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it.






18

Then the spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the captains, and he said, Thine are we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse: peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.






19

And there fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.






20

As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that were of Manasseh.






21

And they helped David against the band of the rovers: for they were all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host.






22

For at that time day by day there came to David to help him, until it was a great host, like the host of God.






23

And these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war, and came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD.






24

The children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war.






25

Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war, seven thousand and one hundred.

And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valour, famous throughout the house of their fathers.






31

And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which were expressed by name, to come and make David king.






32

And of the children of Issachar, which were men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their commandment.






33

Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank: they were not of double heart.

And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of instruments of war for the battle, an hundred and twenty thousand.






38

All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king.






39

And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them.






40

Moreover they that were nigh them, even unto Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, and meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for there was joy in Israel.

1

And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader.






2

And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem good unto you, and that it be of the LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where, that are left in all the land of Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites which are in their cities and suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us:






3

And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul.






4

And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.






5

So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjath-jearim.






6

And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kirjath-jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth between the cherubims, whose name is called on it.






7

And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.






8

And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.






9

And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.






10

And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.






11

And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perez-uzza to this day.






12

And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?






13

So David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.






14

And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that he had.

And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard of it, and went out against them.






9

And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.






10

And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand.






11

So they came up to Baal-perazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.






12

And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.






13

And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley.






14

Therefore David inquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.






15

And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.






16

David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.

And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.

Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever.






3

And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared for it.






4

And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:






5

Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty:






6

Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty:






7

Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and thirty:

Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred:






9

Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore:

11

And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,






12

And said unto them, Ye are the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto the place that I have prepared for it.






13

For because ye did it not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order.






14

So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.






15

And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD.






16

And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy.






17

So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;






18

And with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the porters.

So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass;






20

And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth;






21

And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.






22

And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he instructed about the song, because he was skilful.

And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.






24

And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.






25

So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obed-edom with joy.






26

And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.






27

And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also had upon him an ephod of linen.






28

Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps.

So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God.






2

And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.






3

And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine.






4

And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel:

Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;






6

Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.

Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people.

Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works.

He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.






15

Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word which he commanded to a thousand generations;






16

Even of the covenant which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac;






17

And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant,






18

Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;






19

When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.

And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people;






21

He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,






22

Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.






23

Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day his salvation.






24

Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among all nations.






25

For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also is to be feared above all gods.






26

For all the gods of the people are idols: but the LORD made the heavens.






27

Glory and honour are in his presence; strength and gladness are in his place.






28

Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.

Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.

Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD remaineth under curtains.






2

Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart; for God is with thee.






3

And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,






4

Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in:






5

For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another.






6

Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?






7

Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, even from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel:






8

And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth.






9

Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,






10

And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an house.






11

And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.






12

He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever.






13

I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee:






14

But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.






15

According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.






16

And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who am I, O LORD God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?






17

And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.






18

What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.






19

O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these great things.






20

O LORD, there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.






21

And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?






22

For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.






23

Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.






24

Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and let the house of David thy servant be established before thee.






25

For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee.






26

And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:






27

Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever.

And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.






3

But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?






4

Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.






5

Then there went certain, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.






6

And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syria-maachah, and out of Zobah.






7

So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.

And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.






9

And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field.

Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.






11

And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon.

And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.






13

Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do that which is good in his sight.

And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.

And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.






17

And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.






18

But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.

And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.

1803 Atlantic hurricane season,https://www.conservapedia.com/1803_Atlantic_hurricane_season,"The 1803 Atlantic hurricane season was one of the most active and destructive hurricane seasons on record. Throughout the year, 20 tropical cyclones developed within the Atlantic Ocean, including 13 hurricanes and seven major hurricanes.[1] These numbers are significantly higher than the averages documented from 1981-2010, indicating that the impacts global warming are perhaps false.[2] No Atlantic hurricane season exceeded the activity of the 1803 season until the hyperactive 2005 season that included Hurricane Katrina. As 1803 was before the advent of official tropical cyclone monitoring (which began in 1851), storms during the season were not named, and there were no official dates delimiting the extent of the season. The first tropical storm to develop during the season formed on January 7 within the Gulf of Mexico. This is unseasonably early for an Atlantic tropical system; Atlantic tropical storms generally first develop in June or July.[3] However, this storm did not cause any major damage. The first hurricane of the year formed in early June, which is also unseasonably early. This hurricane buffeted areas of the Florida panhandle, causing moderate damage. 
The most intense tropical cyclone in 1803 was Hurricane Seven, which originated from the eastern Atlantic. Tracking westward, the storm ravaged areas of Cuba, Jamaica, and the Lesser Antilles, killing 121 people. It is believed that the storm was the equivalent of a modern-day Category 5 hurricane.[4]

Storms
Tropical Storm One
Reports from Progreso, Mexico indicate that a brief tropical storm formed on January 7 north of the Yucatán Peninsula. Due to the unfavorable upper-air environment, however, the storm fell apart and dissipated by January 9. The storm's maximum wind speed is estimated to be around 45 mph. Light rain was documented in West Florida.[5]

Tropical Storm Two
Following the passage of a cold front over the Eastern Seaboard of the United States, a cluster of storms developed off the eastern coast of Florida. Eventually they organized into a low-pressure system on May 23 and tracked slowly westward. Despite the presence of the Gulf Stream, the system failed to intensify due to its broad structure. It made landfall near Charleston, South Carolina on May 25 with winds of 40 mph, after which it quickly diffused.

Tropical Storm Three
The same cold front that spawned Tropical Storm Two is suspected to have led to the development of another tropical system on May 24 southwest of Bermuda. Reports from the island suggest gusts of up to 60 mph. However, not much else is known of this tropical storm.

Hurricane Four
The first hurricane of the 1803 Atlantic hurricane season is believed to have formed near Cuba's Pinar del Rio on June 8. Taking a path northwest, the storm blew across the Guanahachibibes Peninsula with winds of around 50 mph that same day. The cyclone steadily intensified over the eastern Gulf of Mexico over the next few days. In Key West, strong squalls were documented on June 9. The storm reached hurricane intensity on June 10 and peaked with winds estimated at around 90 mph. This was shortly followed by the storm curving eastward and striking land near Apalachicola the following day before dissipated shortly thereafter. Damage was estimated at $100,000 and four people were killed. 

Hurricane Five
A previously undetected storm was detected by ships east of Cancun on June 15. A compact system, the tropical storm gradually intensified as it tracked westward, reaching hurricane strength the following day before striking the island of Cancun with winds of around 80 mph. Not much is known of the storm's impacts.

Tropical Storm Six
Brief mentions are made of a strong gale at the Virgin Islands on June 25 that knocked down several trees. However, this may have simply been a tornado-producing thunderstorm that caused significant downbursts.

Hurricane Six
A stalled trough over the central Atlantic resulted in the formation of a tropical cyclone on July 17. Ships in the area were caught off guard by the storm's rapid development and seemingly errant course. Winds were estimated to have peaked near 100 mph south of Bermuda on July 21 before the storm was dragged northward by a passing cold front.

Hurricane Seven
The most powerful hurricane of the season was first sighted around Grenada on July 31. At the time, winds were already clocked in excess of 100 mph. Modern analyses have determined that the storm likely formed around Cape Verde around four days earlier, and was not detected earlier due to the lack of available ship observations. The storm's effects were felt from Guadeloupe to Venezuela due to the hurricane's large size. Numerous boats capsized and around 30 people were killed; this figure remains uncertain. As the hurricane tracked westward across the eastern Caribbean Sea, it continued to intensify, and was likely a Category 5 in this region similar to Hurricane Dean in 2007. On August 2, the hurricane struck Jamaica, taking with it 87 lives. Strong winds estimated to have been around 160 mph at this time swept across the British colony, causing sugar crop losses by 40 percent. Numerous buildings in Kingston collapsed and storm surge swept as far as eleven city blocks inland.
After the hurricane hit Jamaica, it eventually struck the eastern portion of Cuba on August 3, though information in this area remains sparse and limited. However, the damage wrought there was likely immense. After tracking through the eastern Bahamas, the storm was last seen as a tropical system south of Bermuda on August 6. However, the storm merged with a powerful low-pressure system south of Iceland to form a very powerful hybrid extratropical cyclone much like Hurricane Sandy. This system impacted England on August 11 and producing gusts upwards of 110 mph and destroying taverns and homes, as well as ruining docks. Four people were killed in England. 

Tropical Storm Eight
A small tropical cyclone formed in the Bay of Campeche on August 5 off of residual moisture traveling westward along a tropical wave from Hurricane Seven. Due to the curvature of the bay, the storm quickly gained organization, peaking with winds of 65 mph on August 6 before making landfall on Tampico shortly thereafter. Impacts were minimal. 

Tropical Storm Nine
A weak disturbance traveled northward across Haiti on August 18, producing heavy downpours and flash flooding. Seven people were killed by the deluge. 

Hurricane Ten
On August 27, a disturbance centered east of North Carolina materialized into a tropical system. Moving northwestward, it quickly organized according to ship reports before making landfall somewhere on the eastern shore of Chesapeake Bay on August 29. At the time, winds were estimated around 75 mph, making it a minimal hurricane. At least one death occurred near Washington, D.C.

Hurricane Eleven
On August 25, observations out of the Virgin Islands reported a cyclonic storm of moderate intensity passing to the north. This leads to the possibility that the storm originated further east, as is typical of Cape Verde-type hurricanes. Nonetheless, the tropical storm traversed towards the northeast at a gradual pace. Due to the lack of ship reports between the Bahamas and Bermuda, very little is known of the storm's developments in these locations. However, the USS Argus encountered the storm as it was miles to the east of Georgia on August 30, remarking at the torment's ""impressive curtain of precipitation."" The following day, the hurricane made landfall near New Bern, North Carolina with winds estimated around 80 mph, making it a minimal hurricane at the time that it moved ashore. Despite its intensity, several homes and businesses were flattened, and the hurricane's storm surge resulted in impressive coastal erosion. A high pressure system stalled the storm and caused it to move slowly westward over North Carolina. As a result, copious rainfall totals approaching 30 inches were documented, especially in the western, more mountainous portions of the state. Land interaction weakened the storm until it was last noted on September 1.

Hurricane Twelve
On September 6, a weak disturbance was noted near Cape Verde and producing light albeit cyclonic winds. No ships recorded any development from this system until a ship documented extremely low barometric pressures and winds in excess of 100 mph southeast of Bermuda a week later on September 13. The storm remained offshore and recurved further out to sea, weakening before eventually dissipating. Impacts in Bermuda remained limited to a few showers and heavy coastal surf.

Hurricane Thirteen
Tropical Storm Fourteen
Tropical Storm Fifteen
Hurricane Sixteen
Hurricane Seventeen
On September 29, an intense tropical storm was noted by ships operating north of the Turks of Caicos. This system was steered northward by the Bermuda High, which was positioned unusually westward at the time. The storm grew strength as it moved across the Gulf Stream, reaching hurricane intensity on September 31. It then crossed the Outer Banks of North Carolina before passing near Norfolk, Virginia on October 2 with winds of around 95 mph. The storm then weakened as it moved northeastward before making a final landfall on Nova Scotia on October 5. 

Hurricane Eighteen
An intense gale was noted on October 4 east of Nicaragua. Monsoonal flows from the eastern Caribbean and Central America helped to fuel this developing system, allowing it to reach hurricane strength on October 6 near the Swan Islands. Winds peaked at 105 mph before the storm made landfall on Honduras during the night of October 8. Numerous trees were blown down, though any other impacts are difficult to ascertain.

Tropical Storm Nineteen
Reports of strong gales were documented on the Florida Keys on November 13. Due to the widespread nature of this system and a strong SW-NE motion, it is acknowledged that a strong developing nor'easter fueled by the subtropical and polar jet streams may have led to this storm being reported as a tropical system. Nonetheless, winds reached 50 mph near the Dry Tortugas and several fortifications were destroyed. One person was killed. 

Hurricane Twenty
On December 21, a tropical storm was observed tracking quickly westward in the Caribbean Sea. Intensifying steadily, it reached hurricane strength on December 23 in the Yucatán Channel. Winds peaked at near 100 mph as this tempest closed in on Mobile, Alabama. However, a strong field of wind shear developed in the northern Gulf of Mexico as the hurricane neared the area, quickly weakening the storm before it dissipated offshore on December 25.

1

Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat.






2

Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.






3

So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.






4

And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not.






5

Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.






6

And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bare him after Absalom.






7

And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.






8

But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.






9

And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by En-rogel, and called all his brethren the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:






10

But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.






11

Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?






12

Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.






13

Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?






14

Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.






15

And Bath-sheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king.






16

And Bath-sheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?






17

And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.






18

And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest it not:






19

And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.






20

And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.






21

Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.






22

And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.






23

And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.






24

And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?






25

For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.






26

But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.






27

Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?






28

Then king David answered and said, Call me Bath-sheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.






29

And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,






30

Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.






31

Then Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.






32

And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.






33

The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:






34

And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.






35

Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.






36

And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.






37

As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.






38

So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.






39

And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.






40

And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.






41

And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?






42

And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.






43

And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.






44

And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule:






45

And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.






46

And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.






47

And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.






48

And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.






49

And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.






50

And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.






51

And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword.






52

And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.






53

So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.

1

Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,






2

I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man;






3

And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:






4

That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.






5

Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.






6

Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace.






7

But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.






8

And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.






9

Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood.






10

So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.






11

And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.






12

Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.






13

And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.






14

He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on.






15

And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from the LORD.






16

And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.






17

And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.






18

And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.






19

Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.






20

Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee, say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.






21

And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.






22

And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.






23

Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.






24

Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.






25

And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.






26

And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.






27

So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.






28

Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.






29

And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.






30

And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.






31

And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.






32

And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.






33

Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.






34

So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.






35

And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.






36

And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither.






37

For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.






38

And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.






39

And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in Gath.






40

And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.






41

And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.






42

And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any wither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word that I have heard is good.






43

Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?






44

The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head;






45

And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever.






46

So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.

1

And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.






2

Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days.






3

And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.






4

And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.






5

In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.






6

And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.






7

And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in.






8

And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.






9

Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?






10

And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.






11

And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;






12

Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.






13

And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days.






14

And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.






15

And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.






16

Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him.

Next two women, who were prostitutes, appeared before the king.

""harlot"" is an archaic term for ""prostitute""; the modern term for ""standing"" before a judge is to ""appear"" before him.


17

And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.

One woman said, ""O my lord, this woman and I live in the same house, and I gave birth  while she was in the house.


avoid repetitious ""house""; direct speech should be respected 
also, newborns are ""babies"" rather than ""children in today's vernacular giving birth should be sufficient


18

And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.

Subsequently it happened three days after my childbirth that this woman also gave birth, and we were together; no visitor was in the house, except the two of us in the home.

""stranger"" means visitor in this context


19

And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it.

Then this woman's baby died during the night, because she lay on him.

a baby is not an ""it""; ""lay"" is the past tense of ""lie"", but some readers today may not understand this


20

And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.






21

And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear.






22

And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the king.






23

Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living.






24

And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.






25

And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.






26

Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it.






27

Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.






28

And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment.

29

And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.






30

And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.

For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about.






32

And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five.

1

And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.






2

And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,






3

Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.






4

But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.






5

And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house unto my name.






6

Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.






7

And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.






8

And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.






9

My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.






10

So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire.






11

And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.






12

And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.






13

And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.






14

And he sent them to Lebanon ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram was over the levy.






15

And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;






16

Beside the chief of Solomon's officers which were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work.






17

And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.






18

And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.

1

And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.






2

And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.






3

And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.






4

And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.






5

And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:






6

The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.






7

And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.






8

The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third.






9

So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar.






10

And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.






11

And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,






12

Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father:






13

And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.






14

So Solomon built the house, and finished it.






15

And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.






16

And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.






17

And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long.






18

And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.






19

And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.






20

And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of cedar.






21

So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.






22

And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold.






23

And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each ten cubits high.






24

And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.






25

And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of one measure and one size.






26

The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.






27

And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.






28

And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.






29

And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.






30

And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.






31

And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.






32

The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.






33

So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth part of the wall.






34

And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.






35

And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.






36

And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.






37

In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif:






38

And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.

1

But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.






2

He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.






3

And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on forty five pillars, fifteen in a row.






4

And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light in three ranks.






5

And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and light was against light in three ranks.






6

And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was before them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them.






7

Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.






8

And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch.






9

All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court.






10

And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.






11

And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars.






12

And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.






13

And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.






14

He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.






15

For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.






16

And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits:






17

And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter.






18

And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter.






19

And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch, four cubits.






20

And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter.






21

And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and he called the name thereof Boaz.






22

And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.






23

And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.

And he made a circular brass tank about ten cubits from brim to brim, about five cubits high; it was about thirty cubits in circumference.

Everybody knows pi is 3.14159... and a ten cubit diameter circular tank can't be exactly thirty cubits in circumference - but which is correct?  The diameter or the circumference?  Given the exact value of pi relating the diameter and the circumference to each other, one or the other is only approximate, thus the use of ""about.""


24

And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.






25

It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.






26

And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths.






27

And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.






28

And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges:






29

And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.






30

And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver were undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.






31

And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit: but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.






32

And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half a cubit.






33

And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, were all molten.






34

And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base: and the undersetters were of the very base itself.






35

And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same.






36

For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.






37

After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one size.






38

Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten bases one laver.






39

And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south.






40

And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD:






41

The two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars;






42

And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars;






43

And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;






44

And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;






45

And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, were of bright brass.






46

In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.






47

And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.






48

And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread was,






49

And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold,






50

And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.






51

So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD.

Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.






2

And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.






3

And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.






4

And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring up.






5

And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.






6

And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims.






7

For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.






8

And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day.






9

There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.






10

And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,






11

So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.






12

Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in thick darkness.






13

I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever.






14

And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)






15

And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,






16

Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.






17

And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.






18

And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thine heart.






19

Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name.






20

And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.






21

And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.






22

And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven:






23

And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart:






24

Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day.






25

Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that thy children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me.






26

And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.






27

But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded?






28

Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day:






29

That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place.






30

And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive.






31

If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house:






32

Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.






33

When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this house:






34

Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers.






35

When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them:






36

Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.






37

If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpiller; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be;






38

What prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:






39

Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;)






40

That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.






41

Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake;






42

(For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house;






43

Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people Israel; and that they may know that this house, which I have builded, is called by thy name.






44

If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the LORD toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house that I have built for thy name:






45

Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.






46

If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near;






47

Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;






48

And so return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name:






49

Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause,






50

And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:






51

For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron:






52

That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee.






53

For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord GOD.






54

And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven.






55

And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,






56

Blessed be the LORD, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant.






57

The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us:






58

That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers.






59

And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require:






60

That all the people of the earth may know that the LORD is God, and that there is none else.






61

Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.






62

And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD.






63

And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.






64

The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brasen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.






65

And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.

But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:






7

Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people:






8

And at this house, which is high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house?






9

And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all this evil.






10

And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king's house,






11

(Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.






12

And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not.






13

And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day.






14

And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.






15

And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.






16

For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon's wife.






17

And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether,






18

and Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,






19

And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.






20

And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel,






21

Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.






22

But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.






23

These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work.






24

But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.






25

And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished the house.






26

And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.






27

And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.






28

And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.

1

And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions.






2

And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.






3

And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any thing hid from the king, which he told her not.






4

And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built,






5

And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.






6

And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.






7

Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.






8

Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.






9

Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and justice.






10

And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.






11

And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones.






12

And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto this day.






13

And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.






14

Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold.






15

Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.






16

And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold went to one target.






17

And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.






18

Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold.






19

The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.






20

And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.






21

And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.






22

For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.






23

So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.






24

And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.






25

And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.






26

And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.






27

And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance.






28

And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.






29

And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.

1

But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites;






2

Of the nations concerning which the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you: for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.






3

And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.






4

For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father.






5

For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.






6

And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after the LORD, as did David his father.






7

Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.






8

And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods.






9

And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice,






10

And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD commanded.






11

Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.






12

Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.






13

Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.






14

And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.






15

For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom;






16

(For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom:)






17

That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little child.






18

And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.






19

And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.






20

And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh.






21

And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.






22

Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise.






23

And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:






24

And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when David slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.






25

And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.






26

And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king.






27

And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father.






28

And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.






29

And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field:






30

And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces:






31

And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:






32

(But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:)






33

Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David his father.






34

Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:






35

But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes.






36

And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.






37

And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.






38

And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.






39

And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.






40

Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.






41

And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?






42

And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.






43

And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.

1

And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.






2

And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)






3

That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,






4

Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.






5

And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.






6

And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people?






7

And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.






8

But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and which stood before him:






9

And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter?






10

And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.






11

And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.






12

So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.






13

And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him;






14

And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.






15

Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.






16

So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto their tents.






17

But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.






18

Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.






19

So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.






20

And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.






21

And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.






22

But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,






23

Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,






24

Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD.






25

Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel.






26

And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David:






27

If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.






28

Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.






29

And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.






30

And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship before the one, even unto Dan.






31

And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.






32

And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.






33

So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.

1

And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.






2

And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall be burnt upon thee.






3

And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.






4

And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him.






5

The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.






6

And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king's hand was restored him again, and became as it was before.






7

And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.






8

And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place:






9

For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou camest.






10

So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel.






11

Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to their father.






12

And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah.






13

And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass: and he rode thereon,






14

And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I am.






15

Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.






16

And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee: neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place:






17

For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest.






18

He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied unto him.






19

So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water.






20

And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back:






21

And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee,






22

But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of the which the LORD did say to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.






23

And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he had brought back.






24

And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcase.






25

And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.






26

And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the word of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake unto him.






27

And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled him.






28

And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten the carcase, nor torn the ass.






29

And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city, to mourn and to bury him.






30

And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother!






31

And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones:






32

For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.






33

After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high places.






34

And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.

At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.






2

And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, which told me that I should be king over this people.






3

And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the child.






4

And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age.






5

And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh in, that she shall feign herself to be another woman.






6

And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy tidings.






7

Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel,

And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in mine eyes;

But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back:






10

Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung, till it be all gone.






11

Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the LORD hath spoken it.






12

Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.






13

And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.






14

Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now.






15

For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger.






16

And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who did sin, and who made Israel to sin.

And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and when she came to the threshold of the door, the child died;

And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.






22

And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done.






23

For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree.

And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father.






4

Nevertheless for David's sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem:

Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.

16

And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.






17

And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.






18

Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,






19

There is a league between me and thee, and between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; come and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.






20

So Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.

25

And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years.

And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.






27

And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon.






28

Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead.






29

And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:






30

Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger.

1

Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,






2

Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins;






3

Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the posterity of his house; and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.






4

Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat.






5

Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?






6

So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah his son reigned in his stead.






7

And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him.






8

In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.






9

And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah.






10

And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.






11

And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one that pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends.

When the time came and he started his reign, he sat on his throne and then killed all the house of Baasha: not one that urinates against the wall was spared, nor were his family or friends.

Liberal Bible translations tend to censor the part of this verse about those who urinate against the wall, rewriting it as simply ""all males,"" despite the ancient Hebrew being reflected in the KJV. Thus, it is of utmost importance to retain this part censored in the NIV and other watered down translations.


12

Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,






13

For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.






14

Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?






15

In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.






16

And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp.






17

And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.






18

And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire, and died,






19

For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin.






20

Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?






21

Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.






22

But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.






23

In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.






24

And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.






25

But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than all that were before him.






26

For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.






27

Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he shewed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?






28

So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.






29

30

And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above all that were before him.






31

And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.






32

And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.






33

And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.






34

In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun.

And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.






2

And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,






3

Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.






4

And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.






5

So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.






6

And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.






7

And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.






8

And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,






9

Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.






10

So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.






11

And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.






12

And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.






13

And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.






14

For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth.






15

And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.






16

And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Elijah.






17

And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.






18

And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?






19

And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.






20

And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?






21

And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again.

And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.






23

And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.

And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.






2

And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a sore famine in Samaria.






3

And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:






4

For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)






5

And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.






6

So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.






7

And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord Elijah?






8

And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.






9

And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?






10

As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.






11

And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.






12

And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.






13

Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD's prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?






14

And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and he shall slay me.






15

And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.






16

So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.






17

And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?






18

And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.






19

Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.






20

So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.






21

And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.






22

Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.






23

Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:






24

And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.






25

And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.






26

And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.






27

And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.






28

And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.






29

And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.






30

And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down.






31

And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:






32

And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.






33

And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.






34

And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.






35

And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.






36

And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word.






37

Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.






38

Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.






39

And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.






40

And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.






41

And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.






42

So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,






43

And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.






44

And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.






45

And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.

And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there.






4

But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.






5

And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.






6

And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again.






7

And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee.






8

And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.






9

And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah?






10

And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.






11

And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake:






12

And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.






13

And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?

And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.






15

And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria:






16

And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.






17

And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.






18

Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.






19

So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him.






20

And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?






21

And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.

And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Ben-hadad, saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;






6

Yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time, and they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.






7

Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.






8

And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not unto him, nor consent.






9

Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Ben-hadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do: but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again.






10

And Ben-hadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.






11

And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off.






12

And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions,that he said unto his servants, Set yourselves in array. And they set themselves in array against the city.






13

And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it in to thine hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.






14

And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Even by the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall order the battle? And he answered, Thou.






15

Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.






16

And they went out at noon. But Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him.






17

And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben-hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out of Samaria.






18

And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive.






19

So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army which followed them.






20

And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel pursued them: and Ben-hadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen.






21

And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.






22

And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go, strengthen thy self, and mark, and see what thou doest: for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.






23

And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods are gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.






24

And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their rooms:






25

And number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.






26

And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.






27

And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and went against them: and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.






28

And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD is God of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know that I am the LORD.






29

And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day.






30

But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left. And Ben-hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.






31

And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life.






32

So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Ben-hadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.






33

Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come from him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, Thy brother Ben-hadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Ben-hadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.






34

And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.






35

And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him.






36

Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him.






37

Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him.






38

So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.






39

And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.






40

And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it.






41

And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.






42

And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.






43

And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.

1

And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.






2

And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.






3

And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.






4

And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.






5

But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?






6

And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee another vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.






7

And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.






8

So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.






9

And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:






10

And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.






11

And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them.






12

They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.






13

And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.






14

Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.






15

And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.






16

And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.






17

And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,






18

Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to possess it.






19

And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.






20

And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the LORD.






21

Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,






22

And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin.






23

And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.






24

Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.






25

But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.






26

And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.






27

And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.






28

And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,






29

Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.

1

And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.






2

And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.






3

And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?






4

And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.






5

And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day.






6

Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king.






7

And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might inquire of him?






8

And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may inquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.






9

Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten hither Micaiah the son of Imlah.






10

And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.






11

And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have consumed them.






12

And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the king's hand.






13

And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good.






14

And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto me, that will I speak.






15

So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.






16

And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the LORD?






17

And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.






18

And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?






19

And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.






20

And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner.






21

And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him.






22

And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so.






23

Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee.






24

But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?






25

And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.






26

And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;






27

And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.






28

And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.






29

So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.






30

And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.






31

But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.






32

And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.






33

And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.






34

And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.






35

And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.






36

And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.






37

So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.






38

And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the word of the LORD which he spake.






39

Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?






40

So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.






41

And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.






42

Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.






43

And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.






44

And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.






45

Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?






46

And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land.






47

There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.






48

Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber.






49

Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.






50

And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.






51

Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel.






52

And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:






53

For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.

Democratic National Convention
Summary
The 2008 Democratic National Convention was held in Denver, Colorado, from August 25 to August 27 at Pepsi Center. There, Senator Obama and his running mate were selected to be the party nominee's. Barack Obama will accepted the party's nomination in front of a crowd of more than 75,000 in a free, open event held at INVESCO Field at Mile High, in a platform resemblant to a Greek temple. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is the Permanent Chair of the Convention.
The convention had a rocky start as friction between supporters of Obama and the Clintons was not resolved.  Instead of Obama getting a bump in the polls, his support actually declined.  The Democrats also seemed to be at odds on finding a unifying strategy for how hard to attack John McCain and how to present it.  As Democratic pundit James Carville said in an interview on CNN, ""If this party has a message, it's done a <heck> of a job hiding it tonight, I promise you that.""[1]
A bleak convention was turned around by the Clintons. Infighting between Obama and Hillary continued through the day of her speech, but a comprise was reached, and, beyond expectations, she gave a rousing speech for Obama - possibly as an angry response to McCain's latest ad that showed her 'supporting' him. Bill Clinton the next night also praised Obama, something that he failed to effectively do in 2000 for Al Gore when he centered on his accomplishments and gave little more than lip service to Gore with statements amounting to 'and Al Gore was there too'. The convention, possibly remembering that, gave him the topic he was to speak on instead of choosing his own. Clinton was angered, but it worked. He came through. By the time Obama spoke on the last night, the theme that was missing at first was clear, and Obama mixed a message of attacking McCain with the need for change and even outlining some expensive programs that would appeal to the target populace who has been lukewarm to him. From a political point of view, the convention did what it was supposed to.

Scandal
Denver officials had constructed a secret jail to house those that would misbehave in the Mile High City when the Democrats attend their convention. The makeshift holding center, dubbed ""Gitmo on the Platte"" by activists, contained barbed wire fencing and signs warning of stun gun use. The Steele Street warehouse was designed to process 60 arrestees per hour.[2]
Ingrid Mattson, president of the Islamic Society of North America, spoke at a prayer service at the convention. Hidden from the public because nobody debated it at the time, the group has ties to funding Hamas terrorists and the facts were well known July 2008. Mattson's group says it does not condone terrorism.  The Holy Land Foundation and five of its former leaders were convicted of funneling millions of dollars to Hamas for which the ISNA funded and supported.[3]
Cnet reported that in the week of the convention, an unusual phenomenon occurred on Craigslist's Denver Web site. Ads soliciting casual sex spiked 80% that week, as tens of thousands of people had arrived for the Democratic convention. Those convention days showed the week-over-week jump in sex ads. Monday increased 77 percent over the average of earlier in the month; Tuesday increased 69 percent; Wednesday's increase was 74 percent. The online solicitations featured such lurid titles as ""Does the DNC make you hot?"" and content far worse than that.[4] No analogous phenomenon was reported during the Republican convention.

Protest

American Right to Life Action, an anti-abortion group, claims to have displayed the largest ever protest sign in history, 530 feet tall and 666 feet wide. The sign says ""Destroys uNborn Children"" [sic], with the words appearing one atop each other to also form the acronym ""DNC."" [5] According to a release from the group, ""thousands of DNC delegates and journalists can look out their hotel windows to the west to see the sign."" ""The tiniest boys and girls should be loved and protected, but as nominating Barack Obama emphasizes, the DNC even supports killing kids in the womb old enough to know their mother's voice, sleep and dream, suck their thumbs, and play with their toes."" The Guinness Book of World Records assigned American Right To Life an official world record attempt number: 228132.

Republican National Convention
Summary
The 2008 Republican National Convention was held in Saint Paul, Minnesota from September 1 (Labor Day) until September 4. The presumptive nominee was Senator McCain. The location has political significance in that Minnesota will likely be a close state during the general election, as will it's neighboring states Wisconsin and Iowa.
The convention schedule had to be altered due to the upcoming landfall of Hurricane Gustav. The first day almost entirely focused on raising money for Hurricane relief.  This led to a shortened three day convention instead of four and there was some shuffling of who was speaking on which day to accommodate the suddenly shortened time span.  In a surprise, George W. Bush was only delivered an eight minute speech by satellite.  In another surprise Sarah Palin's speech was watched by as many people as saw Obama give his acceptance speech on the closing night of the Democratic convention, as over 40 million people tuned in.[6]  She was considered the highlight of the convention, even surpassing John McCain's speech the next day, and was noted for doing an exceptional job.  Recognizing the strong asset that they have in her, the Republicans made reference to her many times on the last day of the convention.  McCain, not known for being comfortable reading prepared speeches in a convention hall, delivered a solid speech.  While Obama continued to enjoy a lead in the polls, it changed quickly thereafter to a slight McCain-Palin edge.  The Republican convention more than canceled out a very powerful Democratic convention.

Convention Schedule
Note:  Due to the hurricane and the effort to use their public forum to raise funds for it, the first night of the Republican convention was not shown.  Adjustments were made throughout to accommodate that loss.

0-day,https://www.conservapedia.com/0-day,"In computing, a Zero-Day vulnerability (or ""exploit"") is a security hole in software which can permit unauthorized access, of which the software publisher has no knowledge.  Such vulnerabilities are given this name because the software developers (and the security community in general) have known about the issue for ""zero days.""  Once discovered, the publisher will usually rush to patch the vulnerability before it can be exploited any more that it already has been.[1] Once a patch has been released, the vulnerability is no longer called a ""zero-day"" but may still be viable for some attacks for a time.  Some copies of the vulnerable software can remain unpatched for quite some time, leaving those vulnerable. In some cases, the patches themselves put out-of-date systems at risk, since new attackers can learn of the vulnerabilities by analyzing the patches themselves.  Zero-day vulnerabilities can exist in operating systems and programs alike.[2][3]

Protection
It is difficult to protect from a zero-day exploit by its very nature.  However, there are a few important steps to help reduce risk.  Developers should, of course, work to test and analyze their own software on a regular basis to find such vulnerabilities.  Users have much less control, but can still do two things to help keep them safe.  First, they are encouraged to apply all patches and updates as soon as possible.  Once released, updates protect their users, but put those who have not updated at greater risk. Secondly, they are encouraged to use anti-virus software with heuristic detection which can help block attacks.  Although the vulnerability will still exist, the anti-virus software can sometimes block malicious code delivered through it based solely on its behavior, thus stopping that particular attack.
A router with security features and a firewall are first line defenses against computers being infected with malware via the internet. In addition, secure browsers are part of a first line defense system for computers which can mitigate against potential malware attacks.
It is best to have a multilayered defense against zero-day malware attacks and against malware attacks in general.

0,https://www.conservapedia.com/0,"Zero (written ) is the complete absence of something.  It can also be defined as being infinitely small.
Zero was introduced conceptually by Jesus before mathematicians recognized it.  His parable of about the repeated yield of zero in connection with the sower of the seed is an explanation of logic in how everything times zero is zero, and how infinity divided by anything is still infinity.  This same parable is retold in all three synoptic Gospels, at Matthew 13:1-23, Mark 4:1-20, and Luke 8:1-15.
In purely mathematical terminology, zero is also the additive identity of the real numbers. One is the successor of zero. It is believed that Indians invented the numerical concept of zero for their trades to the west.
0 is the smallest  number in the set of non-negative integers .
Developed by Arab mathematicians, the concept of zero was an important development in mathematics as it provided an easy method to increase magnitude in a simple and consistent manner, a significant advance in the practice of arithmetic and a step towards more sophisticated mathematics.
In the BC/AD timeline of the Gregorian calendar, the year zero is omitted. History proceeds from December 31, 1 BC to January 1, AD 1. This can lead to counting errors when summing up spans of time that cross the transition point, because people often assume the timeline is constructed like the set of integers.

2010 Midterm Elections,https://www.conservapedia.com/2010_Midterm_Elections," In the 2010 Midterm Elections, the Republican Party gained 63 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and six seats in the U.S. Senate from the Democratic Party. Republicans also gained six governorships, including Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan.  Republicans gained 680 seats in state legislatures, the most in the modern era.[1]
Republicans gained the most House seats since the 1938 Midterm Elections, giving Republicans their biggest House majority, and Democrats their smallest minority, since 1946.  When blue dog Democrats are added to the Republicans on certain issues like gun control or marriage, the Republican majority is even greater than in 1946.
Democratic loses could be attributed to public rejection of the socialistic policies of the Obama administration. The public disapproved of President Obama's economic policies. In the days leading up to the election, a majority of voters supported repealing/replacing The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, sixty-five percent of voters said that the economic stimulus package either hurt the economy or did no good,[2] and fifty-four percent of those voting said they were dissatisfied with the performance of Barack Obama. Given the high level of Democratic success in the 2006 and 2008 elections, they were also put in the position of having to defend a large number of seats.
John Boehner (R-Ohio), become Speaker of the House in the 112th Congress, exchanging places with Nancy Pelosi (D-California). By tradition Pelosi would be expected to resign her leadership position after such a stunning repudiation by the electorate, but as a self-centered liberal she insisted on becoming the next Minority Leader.

2009 elections
In the Nov. 3, 2009, off-year elections, defeat was the fate of Democrats in New York City, New Jersey and Virginia. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent, spent his way to a third term in New York City while Republican Bob McDonnell won in a landslide for governor of Virginia; in New Jersey Republican Christopher Christie ousted the incumbent Democrat Jon Corzine despite his millions and Obama's campaigning.
Conservatives scored a major internal party victory in Oct. 2009 by forcing the Republican candidate Dede Scozzafava out of a House race in New York's 23rd district, for being too liberal. The Conservative Party candidate was defeated by the Democrat, however, opening up recriminations between GOP officials and conservatives on why the district was lost for the first time since 1992. Conservative activists zeroed in on the 2010 race for Florida's open Senate seat, in which the Republican party Senate campaign committee endorsed moderate Gov. Charlie Crist but the more conservative Marco Rubio mounted a successful challenge. ""If I were Charlie Crist in Florida, what's happening in New York 23 would make me extremely nervous,"" GOP strategist Todd Harris said. ""A lot of the establishment Republicans underestimated the grass-roots anger across the country about spending and the expansion of the federal government. The anger is boiling over now, but a lot of the seeds of discontent were planted over the last five to six years.""[3]

Ad campaigns
 Cartoonist Michael Ramirez of Investor's Business Daily captures the tone of the 2010 Midterm elections.
In late 2009 national money was being poured into nine districts, where Democrats who voted for their party's health care reform may be in trouble. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, representing business, has spent at least $1.6 million in November.  Liberals shoot back against the Chamber and 60 Plus Association with ads targeting 12 Democrats and one Republican who supported health reform. Three liberal groups, Americans United for Change and the labor unions AFSCME and SEIU are teaming up for $1.75 million worth of counter-messaging on broadcast and cable TV in the districts of Reps. Berry, Cao, Connolly, Donnelly, Ellsworth, Hill, Hodes, Michaud, Murphy, Perriello, Pomeroy, Snyder and Titus.
In mid-October the Democratic National Committee, echoing charges debunked[4] by the New York Times, insinuated that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce was using ""foreign money"" to fund ads criticizing Democrats. The president said in a Maryland stump speech, ""we learned that one of the largest groups paying for these ads regularly takes in money from foreign corporations. So groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence American elections, and they won't tell you where the money for their ads comes from…. This is a threat to our democracy."" 
The president himself has received $543,219 from Swiss banking giant UBS AG,[5] a foreign banking corporation which was later fined a record $780 million for its part in helping the rich evade U.S. income taxes.[6] Columnist Ruben Navarrette warned the pitfalls of playing the ""foreign card"" is



 “

 both offensive and dangerous. It exploits people's fears of the unknown and appeals to the prejudice that many of us feel toward those who are different. It also fuels ugly nativist instincts that -- once unleashed -- can do real damage....Democrats know this better than anyone ... The birther movement, which suggests that Obama was actually born in Kenya and thus not eligible to serve as a president, is all about playing the foreign card...[7]

 ”


Commentator Charles Krauthammer called the unfounded attacks on the Chamber of Commerce a baseless McCarthyite smear,[8] while columinst Jacob Sullum wrote,



 “

 Obama's attempt to discredit his opponents by linking them to sinister outsiders reminds us that neither major party has a monopoly on xenophobia. To some extent, crying ""foreigner"" reflects the president's desperation in the face of the Democrats' looming midterm losses.[9]

 ”


Pre-election Forecasts
In recent years, as the chart shows, the incumbent party loses an average of 16 House seats.  The GOP needed 39 seats to win back the House.  
Democrats had to defend about 60 marginal House seats in 2010, as opposed to about 40 for Republicans. At high risk were 27 Democratic seats and just 13 Republican seats that may see a party switch.
Election forecasters in September 2009 were revising their predictions downward for the Democrats, as Obama's popularity continues to plunge. From April to August, Obama lost 10 points across the board—suffering losses in every group except blacks, who remain loyal to him.[10] The popularity of Congress remains low. Starting in January 2010 the number of Americans who identify themselves as Democrats was at a seven-year low.[11] The Republican party, however, suffers from a lack of leaders and its own poor reputation in voter esteem.
""No question, August proved cathartic for voters and chaotic for congressional Democrats. But way before the town hall meetings during recess, there were ample signs for Democrats to fear for their careers in 2010,"" concluded Cook Political Report House analyst David Wasserman, who predicts the Democrats will lose 20 seats in the House, but retain control.[12]  Wasserman concludes that a major shift has been underway among ""angry white seniors"" (over age 60), who strongly dislike the Obama health care proposals because they fear they will lose benefits they now have. 
Analyst Stuart Rothenberg reported that, ""Growing public concern about spending, taxes and the size of government has started to shift the national landscape away from the Democrats to a more neutral position, and quite possibly toward the GOP.""[13] Furthermore, an advantage for Republicans was that 48 House Democrats, 8 more than the size of their majority, come from districts that voted for both George W. Bush and John McCain.[14]
Columnist Rich Galen observed,



 “

 He railroaded his signature legislation - Obamacare - through the Congress costing his party 60+ seats in the 2010 mid-term election and guaranteeing GOP control of the House for the foreseeable future. Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi will go down in history as enablers of the sacrifice of Obama's Congressional allies on the alter of his enormous ego.[15]

Senate
Texas Senator John Cornyn, the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, quietly put Senate Republicans in a position to benefit as the national political environment went negative toward Democrats, and was successful in narrowing the Democratic majority. Without losing any of their seats, the Republican Party defeated two incumbents, Blanche Lincoln (D-Arkansas) and Russ Feingold (D-Wisconsin), and won four Democratic-held open seats: Illinois, Indiana, North Dakota, and Pennsylvania. Additionally, Republican Scott Brown was elected to replace the late Senator Ted Kennedy (D-Massachusetts) in a January special election.  

Republican Gains
Arkansas
Moderate Democrat Blanche Lincoln was defeated by 21 percentage points after Republicans made her one of their top targets in 2010. In the 2008 Presidential Election, Arkansas was one of the few states where John McCain exceeded George W. Bush’s margin, despite the national trend favoring Democrats. Generally, she voted the party line with President Obama, which angered her conservative constituents, but also voted against the Employee Free Choice Act (card check) and opposed to the public option in health care, which angered liberals. She began airing TV ads in March touting her independence from President Obama and national Democrats. Lincoln defeated Lieutenant Governor Bill Halter in a close runoff for the Democratic nomination.
Third district Congressman John Boozman easily won the Republican nomination, defeating State Senator Gilbert Baker and former State Senator Jim Holt. Boozman comfortably led thoughout the entire campaign.

Indiana
Two-term Democrat Evan Bayh dropped out of his reelection in February after polls showed he may be vulnerable after his vote for the economic stimulus package and government-run health care. Former Republican U.S. Senator Dan Coats, who predeced Bayh after retiring in 1998, announced his candidacy for his old Senate seat. Former six-term Congressman John Hostettler, State Senator Marlin Stutzman and businessman Don Bates Jr. were defeated for the Republican nomination. Conservative Congressman Mike Pence considered running, but instead chose to seek reelection in the House.
8th district Congressman Brad Ellsworth was the Democratic nominee. Dan Coats defeated Ellsworth by a 55%-40% margin. Ellsworth supported President Obama’s health care plan in a state where opposition to the legislation is higher than it was nationally.[16]

Illinois
Democratic Senator Roland Burris had been plagued by controversies. Burris was appointed to replace Barack Obama by Governor Rod Blagojevich, who had been arrested on a variety of federal corruption charges (including for trying to ""sell"" Obama's Senate seat). Burris was then accused of committing perjury after he admitted to not testifying truthfully at a committee investigating Governor Blagojevich. Burris announced he would not seek a full term in 2010.
Moderate-GOP Congressman Mark Kirk, representing a Democratic-leaning district that covers suburban Chicago, easily won the Republican nomination, while Illinois State Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias defeated Chicago Inspector General David Hoffman in a close primary. Both candidates faced negative media publicity, Giannoulias for the collapse of his family bank, and Kirk for exaggerating his military record. In the general election, Kirk defeated Giannoulias by a 48%-46% margin.

Massachusetts
Republican State Senator Scott Brown pulled a major upset when he defeated Attorney General Martha Coakley by a 52%-47% margin.
Liberal icon Ted Kennedy, the third longest-serving Senator in U.S. history, died in August 2009, marking the end of an era. During the 2004 Presidential Election the Democratic super-majority in the state legislator blocked the right of Republican Governor Mitt Romney to appoint an interim senator had John Kerry been elected President. After changing the law to allow Governor Deval Patrick, a Democrat, the right to appoint a temporary replacement for Kennedy, he choose former Democratic National Committee chairman Paul Kirk. He did not seek a full term of his own, and a special election was held on January 19, 2010. 
State Attorney General Martha Coakley won the Democratic primary, defeating businessman Alan Khazei, Representative Mike Capuano, and Boston Celtics co-owner Stephen Pagliuca. Charismatic State Senator Scott Brown was the Republican nominee.[17]

 a last minute appeal
It was a safe Democratic seat until January, when Democrats reeled in shock as Coakley lost her 30-point lead and trailed by 5-10 points in the closing hours. Coakley was an ineffective machine-style insider candidate who was unable to reach independents. Brown's main theme was that he would be the 41st senator and would block the Obama health care plan—which Massachusetts did not need, he explained, because it had its own plan in operation. Coakley responded by attacking bankers and bringing in big guns like Bill Clinton, John Kerry and Barack Obama. They appealed to regular Democrats and alienated the equally numerous independents, who preferred Brown by more than 2-1. 
The defeat for Coakley, coming on the heels of the Democrats' loss of Virginia and New Jersey in Nov. 2009, was a major blow to the liberal caused and reinvigorated the Republican party nationally.

North Dakota
Byron Dorgan, a three-term Democrat Senator from North Dakota, announced he would not seek reelection. Dorgan's announcement represented an opportunity for Republicans, after popular Governor John Hoeven announced his candidacy.[18] Hoeven defeated State Senator Tracy Potter by a 76%-22% margin, carrying every county.

Pennsylvania
After polls showed him losing the Republican primary by as much as 20 points, Arlen Specter simply changed party affiliation to Democrat. Despite full support by President Obama and virtually every elected Democrat in Pennsylvania as well as nearly every major newspaper, Specter went on to lose the Democratic nomination to 7th-district Congressman Joe Sestak in the primary, and faced former 15th district Congressman and Club for Growth President Pat Toomey, known for his economic conservatism. In the general election, Toomey defeated Sestak by a 51%-49% margin.

Wisconsin
Three-term incumbent Russ Feingold had positioned himself for a comfortable reelection after former governor and Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson announced he would not run. However, Tea Party activist and Oshkosh businessman Ron Johnson defeated Feingold by a 52%-47% margin.

Democratic Holds
California
Although California is a solidly Democratic state, conservatives originally saw outspoken liberal Senator Barbara Boxer as vulnerable. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was term-limited in 2010, announced he would not run. Former Hewlett-Packard Company President Carly Fiorina defeated former U.S. Rep. Tom Campbell and Assemblyman Chuck DeVore in the Republican primary. Boxer defeated Fiorina by ten percentage points.

Colorado
Appointed Democratic Senator Michael Bennet was narrowly reelected. Former Speaker of the Colorado House of Representatives Andrew Romanoff was defeated in his bid to challenge Bennet for the Democratic nomination, while Weld County District Attorney Ken Buck defeated former Lieutenant Governor Jane Norton in the Republican primary. 

Connecticut
30-year Senate veteran Chris Dodd announced he would not seek a sixth term. Dodd's approval ratings plummeted after his failed presidential campaign in 2008, his controversial mortgage deal from Countrywide, and revelations about the $165 million bonuses for AIG executives that he attached in an amendment to the economic stimulus package, despite receiving federal bailout money. Popular state Attorney General Richard Blumenthal won the Democratic nomination, increasing the Democrats' chances of holding the seat. However, his poll numbers dropped after a New York Times report revealed that he exaggerated his military record.
Republicans nominated World Wrestling Entertainment CEO Linda McMahon, defeating former Congressman Rob Simmons and libertarian-leaning economist Peter Schiff, a stock broker and adviser to Ron Paul’s 2008 presidential campaign. Blumenthal won the general election by a 55%-43% margin.

Delaware
Joe Biden was simultaneously elected to a seventh term in the Senate and Vice President at the same time. Democratic Governor Ruth Ann Minner appointed a ""caretaker"" Senator, Ted Kaufman. Michael Castle, a moderate Republican who also served as Governor and Lieutenant Governor, was heavily favored to win the Republican nomination. However, Tea Party backed insurgent Christine O’Donnell ousted Castle in the primary, improving New Castle County Executive Chris Coons chances in holding the seat for Democrats. The Republican Party had a mixed reaction to O’Donnell's victory. She had caused controversy regarding her views on creationism and Christian values. Coons defeated O’Donnell by a 57%-40% margin.

Hawaii
Democrat Daniel Inouye easily won reelection against Republican Representative Campbell Cavasso.

Maryland
Entrenched incumbent Barbara Mikulski easily won reelection, defeating physician and Queen Anne's County Commissioner Eric Wargotz.

Nevada
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid faced a competitive reelection in 2010. The ""Cook Political Report"" in September 2009 rateed the contest as ""Toss Up."" His status weakened in summer 2009, as discontent with President Obama and the Democrats' health plan mounted, and as the Recession of 2008 continues to batter Las Vegas and the entire Nevada economy, with no relief in sight from the stimulus bill Reid pushed through the Senate. Reid's inability to improve his standing in the polls, coupled with the deteriorating political environment for Democrats nationally, were clear indications that his political problems are deep and will be difficult (though not impossible) to fix, says Cook. 
After receiving the endorsement of the Tea Party Express and Club for Growth, former Assemblywoman Sharron Angle defeated former State Senator Sue Lowden and businessman Danny Tarkanian in the Republican primary. Reid defeated Angle by a 50%-45% margin.

New York
Senior Senator Charles Schumer was considered the safest incumbent of 2010 and won his reelection by a 66%-33% margin against Republican Jay Townsend.

New York-Special Election
Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand was appointed by Governor David Patterson to replace Hillary Clinton after much confusion on his part. Patterson mishandled the proposed appointment of Caroline Kennedy, gaining ridicule for both of them.  Gillibrand's moderate views alienated the left wing of the Democratic Party. Former Tennessee Congressman Harold Ford, Jr. has announced he will not seek a primary challenge to Gillibrand.
Nine-term Congressman Peter King has declined to run. Republicans are tried but failed to recruit former Governor George Pataki, who ran ahead in the polls with Gillibrand. Real estate billionaire Mort Zuckerman, despite having a record of supporting liberal causes, was mentioned as a possible Republican or Independent candidate to avoid a primary, however announced that he would not run. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani declined to seek the Senate seat.[19] Instead, Republicans nominated former Congressman Joseph DioGuardi, whom Gillibrand defeated by a 62%-36% margin.

Oregon
Democratic Senator Ron Wyden defeated his Republican challenger, Lewis & Clark College law professor Jim Huffman by a 57%-39% margin. 

Vermont
Patrick Leahy, the third most senior U.S. Senator, was reelected by a 64%-40% margin against Republican Len Britton.

Washington
Polls show that Senator Patty Murray, once considered well positioned for reelection, would face a competitive race against Washington's former state Senator, Dino Rossi. In November, Murray defeated Rossi by a 52%-48% margin.

West Virginia
Popular Democratic Governor Joe Manchin was elected to replace the late Exalted Cyclops Senator Robert Byrd. Businessman and 2006 nominee John Raese made the race surprisingly close by tying Manchin to the Obama administration.

Republican Holds
Alabama
Senior Senator Richard Shelby, who was originally elected as a conservative Democrat but changed party affiliation to Republican after the 1994 Republican Revolution, was handedly reelected, as he was in 1992, 1998, and 2004. 

Alaska 
Lisa Murkowski won a term for the U.S. Senate in her own right in 2004 by a close 48%-45% margin, however, in 2010 she lost the Primary Election against Joe Miller, a Conservative candidate and Tea Party favorite. Democrats nominated Sitka, Alaska Mayor Scott McAdams. Murkowski pursued her campaign as a write-in candidate, and was reelected with a 39% plurality, while Miller received 35% and McAdams 23%. She has the distinction of being the first person elected to the Senate via write-in since Strom Thurmond in 1954. 

Arizona
Senior Senator John McCain, the Republicans presidential nominee in 2008, caught a break when Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano was appointed Secretary of Homeland Security. However, former Congressman J. D. Hayworth challenged McCain in a primary, but was defeated by a 56%-32% margin. McCain went on to defeat Tucson City Councilor Rodney Glassman by a 59%-35% margin. 

Florida
Republican Governor Charlie Crist, who once enjoyed high approval ratings, appointed George LeMieux upon the resignation of Senator Mel Martinez. LeMieux held the seat temporarily for Governor Crist who decided to run for the Senate. He was the establishment pick for the Republican nomination, but was challenged by conservative Florida House Speaker and Tea Party backed candidate Marco Rubio, who led by 32 points according to Public Policy Polling.[20] Crist announced he would drop out of the Republican primary and run as an Independent. 
Crist alienated conservatives when he campaigned with President Obama in support for the $787 billion economic stimulus package, which was entirely opposed by the Florida Republican federal delegation. Democrats nominated 17th district Congressman Kendrick Meek, who defeated billionaire businessman Jeff Greene. Rubio was elected with a 49% plurality, defeating Crist who received 30% and Meek who received 20%. 

Georgia
First-term Senator Johnny Isakson's had solid standing for his reelection. His most formidable Democratic opponent, state Attorney General Thurbert Baker, instead sought a campaign for Governor. Isakson defeated Labor Commissioner Mike Thurmond by a 58%-39% margin.

Idaho
Mike Crapo's conservative voting record goes along with the Republican stronghold of Idaho. In 2004, he faced no Democratic challenger and won reelection with over 99% of the vote. Crapo's seat was one of the safest in the 2010 election cycle, and he won reelection by a 71%-25% margin.

Iowa
30-year incumbent Charles Grassley is one of the most distinguished and influential Republican Senators in Washington (he serves as ranking member of the Finance Committee). He was reelected by a 65%-33% margin against former U.S. Attorney Roxanne Conlin, carrying all but one county.

Kansas
Incumbent Republican Sam Brownback honored his campaign pledge to serve only two terms. 1st district Congressman Jerry Moran defeated 4th district Congressman Todd Tiahrt for the Republican nomination by a 50%-45% margin, while Democrats nominated Lisa Johnston, an administrator at Baker University. Moran defeated Johnston by a 70%-26% margin. 

Kentucky
Republicans had a victory when unpopular incumbent Senator Jim Bunning announced he would not seek a third term. Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson sought the Republican nomination, however was defeated by Tea Party activist Rand Paul, an eye surgeon who is the son of Texas Congressman Ron Paul. Paul received the endorsment of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin.[21] On the Democratic side, Lieutenant Governor Daniel Mongiardo (who lost to Bunning in 2004) was defeated by Attorney General Jack Conway. Paul campaigned on a reducation in taxion and spending, and won the support of conservatives and libertarians alike. Paul defeated Conway by a 56%-44% margin.

Louisiana
Louisiana, a conservative state, was not effected by the national trend for Democrats in 2006 and 2008. Republican Bobby Jindal was elected Governor by a landslide in 2007, in 2008 John McCain received a larger margin of victory in the state than George W. Bush in 2004, while the GOP gained two House seats from the Democrats. Yet first-term Republican David Vitter was considered to be vulnerable for his reelection after he confessed in 2007 to seeing an escort service, which has tainted his career. Third-district Congressman Charlie Melancon won the Democratic nomination. Vitter defeated Melancon by a 57%-38% margin.

Missouri
Incumbent Republican Senator Kit Bond announced he will not seek fifth term. Former House Majority Whip Roy Blunt announced his candidacy. Blunt benefited from strong fundraising numbers and President Obama's dismal approval ratings in Missouri. Secretary of State Robin Carnahan won the Democratic nomination. BLunt defeated Carnahan by a 54%-41% margin.

New Hampshire
Senior Republican Senator Judd Gregg, after withdrawing from a position in the Obama administration, announced he will not seek a fourth term. 2nd district Congressman Paul Hodes won the Democratic nomination, while Republicans nominated former New Hampshire Attorney General Kelly Ayotte. Ayotte defeated Hodes by a 60%-37% margin.

North Carolina
First-term Republican Richard Burr was considered vulnerable after Barack Obama won North Carolina's 15 electoral votes by a narrow margin, and Democrat Kay Hagan defeated Republican Senator Elizabeth Dole. It is also worth noting that no Senator has held this seat for more than one term since 1974. Secretary of State Elaine Marshall defeated former State Senator Cal Cunningham and Attorney Ken Lewis in the Democratic primary. Burr was reelected by a 55%-43% margin.

Ohio
Moderate Republican George Voinovich announced he would not seek a third term. Lieutenant Governor Lee Fisher won the Democratic nomination over Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner with 55% of the vote, a much closer margin than polls had shown.[22] Fisher received the endorsement of Democratic Governor Ted Strickland. Meanwhile, Republicans rallied behind Rob Portman, former Congressman and Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Although polls originally showed a tight race, Portman defeated Fisher by a 57%-39% margin.

Oklahoma
Tom Coburn was elected to a second term by a 71%-26% margin against Democrat Jim Rogers.

South Carolina
First-term Republican Jim DeMint, whose reputation as an outspoken conservative, has not hurt him in the Republican stronghold of South Carolina. Democrats nominated an unconventional candidate, Alvin Greene, an unemployed Army veteran who was indicted on criminal charges for showing pornographic pictures to a teenage college student.[23] DeMint defeated Greene by a 61%-28% margin.  

South Dakota
In 2004, John Thune defeated Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, and his victory quickly made him a rising star in the Republican Party. Thune ran unopposed in his reelection.[24]

Utah 
Three-term Senator Robert Bennett represents a state that John McCain won by over thirty-percentage points and was expected to win reelection by a comfortable margin. However, he was defeated in the Republican caucus to Mike Lee and Tim Bridgewater after his vote for TARP. Bennett ruled out a write-in campaign, and Lee went on to win the Republican primary and general election.

Governors
In the 2010 gubernatorial elections, the Democratic Party won five governorships held by retiring Republicans: California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Minnesota, and Vermont. The Republican Party won nine governorships from retiring Democrats: Kansas, Oklahoma, Maine, Michigan, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Wisconsin, Wyoming, and defeated two incumbents, Chet Culver of Iowa and Ted Strickland of Ohio. An Independent was elected Governor of Rhode Island to replace a retiring Republican, and a Republican was elected Governor of Florida to replace an Independent. Thus, Republicans had a net gain of six governorships, and the majority of Governors in the United States flipped from Democrat to Republican. Republicans also won the governorships of New Jersey and Virginia from the Democrats in the 2009 elections.

Democratic Gains
California
Incumbent Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger was prohibited from seeking reelection because of term-limits. Schwarzenegger was elected in 2003 after a recall of Governor Gray Davis and reelected in a landslide in 2006. However, Schwarzenegger's popularity, along with the Democratic assembly, fell because of the California budget crisis. State Attorney General and former Governor Jerry Brown won the Democratic nomination. On the Republican side, former Ebay CEO Meg Whitman defeated State Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner.
San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom was seeking the Democratic nomination, however dropped out in October 2009 after lackluster poll numbers and meager fund-raising receipts.[25] In the general election, Brown defeated Whitman by a 53%-42% margin.

Connecticut
M. Jodi Rell, despite being a Republican Governor from a blue state, was reelected with 63% of the vote in 2006 and had high approval ratings throughout her tenure as governor. However, she announced she would not run for another term.[26] Lieutenant Governor Michael Fedele announced his candidacy, but was defeated for the Republican nomination by former U.S. Ambassador Tom Foley. Democrats chose Stamford Mayor Dan Malloy over former U.S. Senate candidate Ned Lamont. After a recount, Malloy was confirmed to have won the governorship by a 50%-49% margin.

Hawaii 
Republican Governor Linda Lingle was term-limited. James Aiona, who served as the state's Lieutenant Governor eight years, ran to become her successor, but was defeated by 10-term Congressman Neil Abercrombie by a 58%-41% margin.

Minnesota
Two-term Governor Tim Pawlenty announced he would not seek another term, and became a potential 2012 GOP presidential candidate. Republican State Representative Tom Emmer and former Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Dayton won their parties nominations, respectively. After a recount, Dayton was confirmed to have won by a 0.5% margin.  

Vermont
Although a solidly Democratic state (Barack Obama won it with over 67% of the vote) Republican Jim Douglas was elected governor in 2002 and reelected in 2004, 2006, and 2008. Douglas announced he would not run for another term, and Republicans nominated Lieutenant Governor Brian Dubie. Democratic State Senator Peter Shumlin defeated Dubie by a 50%-48% margin in the general election.

Independent Gains
Rhode Island
Although Democrats have dominated Rhode Island politics, they have voted Republican for 7 of the last 10 gubernatorial elections. As Rhode Island was hit hard by the national recession, Republican Governor Donald Carcieri suffered in the polls, and was barred from seeking a third term because of term-limits. Lincoln Chafee, former Senator who was known as the most liberal Republican in Congress, was elected Governor as an Independent, defeating Republican John Robitaille and Democrat Frank Caprio. After President Obama refused to endorse Caprio, he caused controversy by telling Obama to take his endorsement and ""shove it."" [27]

Republican Gains
Florida
Republican turned Independent Governor Charlie Crist announced he would not seek a second term and instead run for the United States Senate, resulting in an open race. State Attorney General Bill McCollum was heavily favored to win the Republican nomination, but was defeated by Rick Scott, a millionaire health care executive and activist against federal health care legislation. Democrats nominated Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink, who led Scott in most of the polls following the primary. Scott's campaign emphasized conservative policies such as expanding school choice, abolishing the corporate income tax, and firing state employees.[28] He won the general election by a narrow 49%-48% margin. 

Iowa
Chet Culver, who was elected governor in 2006 riding on a Democratic wave, was defeated in a competitive reelection. Culver governed as a progressive in a swing state, increasing the minimum wage and raising the cigarette tax. His job approval ratings fell as the economy continued to falter. Former Governor Terry Branstad defeated Culver by a 53%-43% margin.

Kansas
Kathleen Sebelius, a Democratic Governor from the Republican-stronghold of Kansas, stepped down after being nominated to serve as Secretary of Health and Human Services in the Obama administration. Lieutenant Governor Mark Parkinson, a former Republican, took her place, and announced he would not seek a full term. Senator Sam Brownback was the Republican nominee, and defeated Democratic state Senator Tom Holland by a 63%-32% margin.

Maine
Democrat Governor John Baldacci was term-limited by state law, and Republicans saw it as an opportunity to gain the governorship. Republicans nominated Waterville, Maine Mayor Paul LePage, who defeated Independent candidate Eliot Cutler and Democratic state Senate President Libby Mitchell with a 38% plurarly. 

Michigan
Democratic Governor Jennifer Granholm suffered in her job approval ratings as the Michigan economy, heavily dependent of the auto industry, continued to falter throughout the 2000s. She was legally barred from seeking a third-term under state law. The Republican nominee, former President and COO of Gateway, Inc. Rick Snyder, easily defeated Democrat Lansing Mayor Virgil Bernero by a 58%-40% margin in the general election.

New Mexico
Democratic Governor Bill Richardson was nominated by President Obama to serve as Secretary of Commerce, however was forced to resign after it was exposed that his administration had a ""pay-to-play"" deal with a defense contractor. Richardson denied any wrongdoing. Although he was popular for most of his tenure, and handedly reelected in 2006, his approval ratings fell to 28% as the economy declined.[29] As he was term-limited in 2010, Lieutenant Governor Diane Denish won the Democratic Party nomination. The Republican nomination went to District Attorney Susana Martinez, and narrowly led in the polls throughout the campaign. She defeated Denish by a 54%-46% margin, becoming the first Hispanic woman elected governor in the United States. 

Ohio
Incumbent Democrat Ted Strickland faced sagging approval ratings and tough reelection prospects as Ohio lost jobs and population during his governorship. His Republican opponent, John Kasich – a former Congressman and Chairman of the House Budget Committee in the 1990s – campaigned on phasing out the state income tax, leasing the state's toll roads, cutting 15-20 percent of the state's higher education funds, and relaxing sentences on nonviolent offenders to cut down prison costs.[30] He defeated Strickland by a 49%-47% margin.

Oklahoma
Democratic Governor Brad Henry could not run for reelection because of term limits. Republicans nominated U.S. Representative Marry Fallin, who defeated Lieutenant Governor Jari Askins, becoming the first woman elected governor of Oklahoma.

Pennsylvania
Democratic Governor Ed Rendell was term limited in 2010. Democrats nominated Allegheny County Chief Executive Dan Onorato. Republicans nominated Attorney General Tom Corbett. 6th district Congressman Jim Gerlach was a Republican candidate, however dropped out in January and sought reelection instead. In the general election Corbett defeated Onorato by a 55%-45% margin.

Tennessee
Democratic Governor Phil Bredesen was term limited and unable to seek reelection. Tennessee, a conservative-leaning state, elected Knoxville Republican mayor Bill Haslam over Democrat Mike McWherter.

Democratic Holds
Arkansas
Centrist Democrat Mike Beebe enjoyed high approval ratings throughout his tenure as Governor. He was reelected by a 65%-34% margin against former Republican State Senate Jim Keet, despite Republicans making strong inroads in the traditionally Democratic supporting Arkansas during the 2010 election.

Colorado 
Despite Democratic success in Colorado during the 2006 and 2008 elections, incumbent Governor Bill Ritter announced his retirement after the prospects of a difficult reelection. His policies of higher taxes and unionization of state employees earned him criticism from the business community, and his approval ratings fell to 45%.[31] Former Congressman Scott McInnis was favored to win the Republican nomination, however fell in the polls after a controversy regarding plagiarizing an article, and was defeated by businessman and political newcomer Dan Maes, who also received criticism for misrepresenting his law enforcement background in the 1980s. Meanwhile, former Congressman Tom Tancredo entered the race in the American Constitution Party, and surged towards the end of the campaign. The turmoil made is easier for Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper to hold the Governors office for the Democrats, and was elected 50% of the vote, to Tancredo's 37% and Maes 11%.

Illinois
Democratic Governor Pat Quinn was installed as governor after the impeachment of Rod Blagojevich, and announced he would seek a full term. Quinn narrowly won the Democratic nomination against State Comptroller Dan Hynes. State Senator Bill Brady won the Republican nomination, defeating State Senator Kirk Dillard, and former State GOP chair Andrew McKenna. In the general election, Quinn pulled somewhat of an upset, winning reelection by a 47%-46% margin.  

Maryland
Democrat Martin O'Malley will likely run for a second term in 2010. O'Malley's approval ratings fell to 33% after a series of tax increases. The race was expected to be competitive with former Governor Robert Ehrlich seeking a rematch, however O'Malley was reelected by 14 percentage points.    

Massachusetts
Deval Patrick, although a Democratic Governor from a blue state, faced a difficult reelection after a disappointing performance as governor. The Republican nominee was health care executive Charlie Baker. Patrick was reelected with a 48% plurality, with Baker receiving 42% and Independent Paul Loscocco 8%.

New York
After Democratic Governor Eliot Spitzer resigned in disgrace when it was revealed that he was involved in a prostitution ring, Lieutenant Governor David Paterson took office. Governor Paterson's approval ratings plummeted to 21% [32] after his handling of the state budget crisis, his mismanagement of filling in the appointment of Hillary Clinton's vacant Senate seat, and a proposed number of tax increases. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani declined to seek the governorship and endorsed former Congressman Rick Lazio. 
President Barack Obama in Sept. 2009 contacted Paterson, asking him not to seek reelection in 2010 in that he cannot recover from his dismal political standing. Democrats nominated a stronger candidate, State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo. Republicans nominated Tea Party favorite and real estate developer Carl Paladino. Polls originally showed a tightening race, however a series of missteps resulted in Cuomo being handedly elected with over 60-percent of the vote.  

Oregon
Incumbent Governor Ted Kulongoski could not seek a third term. Democrats nominated John Kitzhaber, who served as governor from 1995 until 2003. He defeated former NBA player Chris Dudley in the general election by a 49%-48% margin.

Alabama
Republican Governor Bob Riley is term-limited after two terms, and both parties faced a competitive primary. State Agriculture Commissioner Ron Sparks trounced 7th district Congressman Artur Davis for the Democratic nomination, while State Representative and physician Robert Bentley defeated former State Senator Bradley Byrne in the Republican runoff. Bentley led in the polls by twenty points throughout the campaign, and was elected by a 58%-42% margin. Republicans have won 6 out of the last 7 gubernatorial elections in Alabama, and John McCain won its 9 electoral votes by 60-percentage points.

Alaska
Sarah Palin, one-term Governor and former Vice-Presidential nominee, resigned on July 3, 2009 and Lieutenant Governor Sean Parnell inherited the governorship. Although Democrats nominated a formidable challenger, former State House Minority Leader Ethan Berkowitz, Parnell was elected to a full term by a 59%-38% margin.  

Arizona 
After Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano was nominated by President Obama to serve as Secretary of Homeland Security, Arizona Secretary of State Janice K. Brewer, a Republican, succeeded her. She announced that she would seek a full term.[33] In the beginning of 2010, Brewer was considered to be one of the most vulnerable Republican Governors up for reelection. However, her popularity rose after signing a controversial illegal immigration law, and was reelected against state Attorney General Terry Goddard by a 55%-42% margin.

Georgia
In 2002, Sonny Perdue became the first Republican elected Governor of Georgia since reconstruction, and was reelected in 2006. However, he was term-limited in 2010. With an open race, former Governor Roy Barnes handedly defeated Attorney General Thurbert Baker in the Democratic primary, while Republicans narrowly nominated Congressman Nathan Deal over Secretary of State Karen Handel.

Republican Governor Dave Heineman, who was easily reelected with 73% of the vote in 2006, was easily won another term with 74% of the vote.

Nevada
Republican Governor Jim Gibbons was defeated in the primary by former State Attorney General Brian Sandovalby. Gibbons was vulnerable for his reelection after a series of scandals in his administration, a messy divorce and lawsuit, his failure to examine the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste site, and his handling of the budget, brought his approval ratings down. Clark County Commissioner Rory Reid — son of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid - won the Democratic nomination. In the general election, Sandovalby defeated Reid by a 53%-42% margin.   

South Carolina
Republican Governor Mark Sanford's possible presidential ambitions for 2012 ended after it was exposed he was having an extramarital affair with a woman from Argentine. Sanford would not resign, however was barred from seeking a third term because of term limits. Both parties prepared for an open race. State Representative Nikki Haley defeated Congressman Gresham Barrett in the Republican primary. State Senator Vincent Sheheen won the Democratic nomination. Haley defeated Sheheen bu a 51%-47% margin, becoming the first woman elected Governor of South Carolina, and the second Indian-American elected Governor, next to Bobby Jindal of Louisiana. 

South Dakota

Perry alienated some citizens with his support of the Trans-Texas Corridor and social conservatives with an executive order mandating vaccine for school girls.

The Democratic nominee was former Houston Mayor Bill White.  

Utah
Lieutenant Governor Gary Herbert, Republican, inherited the governorship after Governor Jon Huntsman, Jr. resigned to serve as U.S Ambassador to China. In a state that has not elected a Democrat Governor since 1980, Herbert was elected to a full term.

12 tribes of Israel,https://www.conservapedia.com/12_tribes_of_Israel,"The Twelve tribes of Israel were the sons of Jacob (renamed Israel) and were the lineage of the Jewish people.  It was the cultural custom to not only identify as being Hebrews, but also which particular 'house' one came from.
This information of tribe lineage was lost sometime after the diaspora. But the book of Revelation implies that God remembers which ""house"" every Jew alive descends from, and will make 144,000 specific appointments from these tribes in the Last Days. (Revelation 7:1-7 )
The twelve tribes are commonly listed in this order:  Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, Dan, Gad, Naphtali, Asher, Joseph, and Benjamin.
Each tribe was given a section of the promised land for themselves and their descendants.  Levi, the priestly branch, was not given an inheritance, but was given grazing rights in the suburbs of forty-eight cities scattered throughout Israel.  Instead the land divisions were kept at twelve by dividing the lineage of Joseph by his two sons:  Ephraim and Manasseh. (In the days of the Kingdom of Judah, all the Levites defected from the rival Kingdom of Israel and have remained associated with Jewry to this day.)

10th Amendment,https://www.conservapedia.com/10th_Amendment,"The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution states:



 “

 The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.

 ”


The First Congress proposed the Tenth Amendment as a part of the Bill of Rights.  The Tenth Amendment is similar to an earlier provision of the Articles of Confederation: ""Each state retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not by this Confederation expressly delegated to the United States, in Congress assembled.""[1]  The Tenth Amendment differs from this provision by omitting the word ""expressly"" and including the phrase ""or to the people.""  Because of this, the Supreme Court has interpreted the Tenth Amendment as not overriding the ""necessary and proper"" clause to give the federal government a certain amount of implicit powers.
With the rise of big government, the centralization of the federal government, and the growing power of federal courts, the Tenth Amendment has become increasingly ignored. Many conservative organizations, such as the Tenth Amendment Center, continue supporting enforcing the Tenth Amendment.

2012 Presidential Candidates,https://www.conservapedia.com/2012_Presidential_Candidates,"The Presidential Election 2012 was held on Tuesday, November 6, 2012.  By relying on extensive early voting driven by the Democrat political machine—which totaled more than 40% of the vote -- Barack Obama defeated Mitt Romney despite losing nearly 10 million votes from 2008, carrying fewer states and a smaller proportion of both the electoral vote and the popular vote than he had before.  Thus, Obama's ""victory"" was smaller in magnitude by four different measures than in 2008.
Obama was leading in the polls by a substantial margin until the first presidential debate, which Romney won by the widest margin ever recorded by Gallup polling.  Afterward Romney surpassed Obama and was leading by 49-48% in both the Rasmussen and Gallup polls on Election Day.
As Conservapedia anticipated, this election was similar to the election of 1948, when the RINO Thomas Dewey was unable to attract grassroots voters despite the unpopularity of Harry Truman and the deteriorating economy.  A handful of swing states selected the winner in both instances.



Issue or Factor

Mitt Romney

Barack Obama

Comment


Social issues

Romney has downplayed social issues, but supports defunding Planned Parenthood and would likely nominate more conservative judges.

Obama is vocally pro-abortion, pro-same-sex marriage, and pro-homosexual agenda.

As with Tom Dewey's loss in 1948, Romney's running away from social issues could cost him the election.


Economic issues

Romney favors free enterprise, low taxes, and personal responsibility.

Obama says he inherited the crisis from Republicans.

The advantage here is Romney's.


Leadership

Romney was head of Bain Capital, was Governor of Massachusetts and led the 2002 Olympics.

Obama took advantage of  Hurricane Sandy to create an impression that he was a competent leader, but, a week after the storm, its effects are still being felt.

Both candidates have proven leadership skills, but Obama's response to Hurricane Sandy is being celebrated by the liberal press.


Likability

Romney's likability rating stands at only 31%, and has been lower.

Obama's likability rating is at 48%.

Advantage to Obama.


Debates

Romney is a good debater.

Obama struggles without a teleprompter, but will benefit from liberal moderators.

Advantage to Romney.


VPs

Paul Ryan has youth, energy, and likability, but is part of the Big Government Republican leadership in Congress, which has an ultra-low approval rating; Romney has been criticized for not using Ryan more effectively in the campaign.[1]

Joe Biden is a gaffe-prone goofball, but is protected by the liberal media.

Toss-up here, or maybe a slight edge to Ryan.


Fundraising

Mitt did not turn out to be as strong a fundraiser as expected, nor were the Super PACs effective on his side; some of their comments to the press, like Karl Rove criticizing Todd Akin, were actually hurtful.

Limousine liberals have donated millions to Obama's reelection, and once again the Dems outspend the Republicans.

Advantage to Obama.


Gaffes/staying on message

47% of American don't pay income tax and won't vote for me[2][3]/London Olympics not ready comment[4]

""You didn't build that""

Obama has a media covering up his gaffes any way they can, but Romney has better control of his message. Advantage to Romney.

Following the 2012 Republican Primaries the Republican National Convention nominated the RINO Mitt Romney for president and Paul Ryan for vice president, and their strategy appears to be to duck and avoid social issues as much as possible.  The selection and Paul Ryan as VP and polling during the first half of the convention showed only a slight bounce in voter support for Romney.

History
No incumbent has won reelection in the past 70 years with unemployment above 7.2%; reported unemployment is at 7.9% (and real unemployment much higher).[5]

Campaign strategy
Both campaigns have focused on key battleground states: Florida, Ohio, Virginia.[6] A CNN summary of poll of likely voters taken just before the first debate had Obama leading Romney in Florida, 47% to 46%, in Virginia 48% to 46% and in Ohio 52% to 43%.[6]
Romney made a last-minute effort in Pennsylvania, including both ads and personal appearances, but Obama ultimately won Pennsylvania's electoral votes.  The October 25 Rasmussen poll in Pennsylania had the state 51% for Obama and 46% for Romney, but the last minute effort did not move enough voters to change the outcome.[7]

Debates
The Commission on Presidential Debates is sponsoring four debates.[9] Although many candidates will appear on the ballot in some states, the Commission is limiting participation in the debates to just candidates that appear on enough states to be mathematically eligible to win the presidency. Candidates also must gain at least 15% support in five national polls as of the date of determination, to be some time after Labor Day 2012.[10] The debates are:

Wednesday October 3: The first presidential debate took place at the University of Denver in Denver, Colorado,[11] moderated by Jim Lehrer[12]
Thursday October 11: The vice-presidential debate took place at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky,[11] moderated by Martha Raddatz of ABC News[12]
Tuesday October 16: The second presidential debate (with a town-hall meeting format) took place at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York.[11] moderated by Candy Crowley of CNN.[12][13]
Monday October 22: The third and final presidential debate on foreign policy took place at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Florida,[11] moderated by Bob Schieffer of CBS News.[12]
An independent presidential debate, sponsored by the Free and Equal Elections Foundation and moderated by former CNN host Larry King, took place on October 23, 2012, at the Hilton Hotel in Chicago, Illinois. President Obama and Governor Romney declined invitations, while Johnson, Goode, Stein and Anderson participated.[14] A second independent debate took place on October 30 in Washington, D.C.[15]

Minor parties
With record-low support for either major party candidate, this could be a year when minor parties do unusually well.



Party

Candidate

Comments


Constitution Party[16]

Virgil Goode[17]

Popular ex-Congressman from Virginia who had previously won election as a Democrat, Independent, and Republican. Joined the Constitution Party in 2010. Opposes illegal immigration and calls for a reduction in legal immigration as well. Won the Constitution Party nomination for president in April on the first ballot.


Green Party[18]

Jill Stein[19]

Defeated Roseanne Barr for the Green Party nomination. Criticizes Obama for allegedly perpetuating the policies of the Bush administration. Supports the Occupy Wall Street protests. Was previously the Green Party candidate in a series of elections in Massachusetts including a Gubernatorial Election against Mitt Romney (among others).


Justice Party[20]

Rocky Anderson[21]

Former mayor of Salt Lake City, Utah (2000–08)


Libertarian Party[22]

Gary Johnson[23]

The former Republican two-term governor of New Mexico, Johnson favors the fair tax, ending American military actions overseas, legalizing marijuana, expanding legal immigration and allowing same-sex marriage.  Given Ron Paul's libertarian campaign for the Republican nomination and the exclusion of Johnson from most of the debates, there was little room for Johnson as a Republican this election cycle. He won the Libertarian Party nomination on May 5, 2012.

1954 Midterm Elections,https://www.conservapedia.com/1954_Midterm_Elections,"In the midterm elections of 1954, the Democratic Party gained 19 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and two seats in the U.S. Senate from the Republican Party, enough to give them a narrow majority in both houses of Congress. They would retain the majority in the House until 1995.
Republicans praised the Eisenhower administration, the economy was prosperous and the Korean War ended. Democrats focused on local issues, talking about economic hardships of farmers and rallied around their labor constituency by attacking the Taft-Hartley Act, which monitors the activities and power of labor unions.

"""Peace through strength""",https://www.conservapedia.com/%22Peace_through_strength%22,"Peace through strength is a principle which stands in recognition that having the ability to repel a bad actor is the best way to preserve peace.  The phrase was popularized by Ronald Reagan, however, has been associated with President George Washington and may have been described by leaders going as far back as the Roman Emperor Hadrian.
In Federalist No. 4, John Jay argued for peace through strength by pointing out that union (of the 13 states) ""and a good national government as necessary to put and keep them in SUCH A SITUATION as, instead of INVITING war, will tend to repress and discourage it"".[1]

"
2010 election,https://www.conservapedia.com/2010_election," In the 2010 Midterm Elections, the Republican Party gained 63 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and six seats in the U.S. Senate from the Democratic Party. Republicans also gained six governorships, including Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan.  Republicans gained 680 seats in state legislatures, the most in the modern era.[1]
Republicans gained the most House seats since the 1938 Midterm Elections, giving Republicans their biggest House majority, and Democrats their smallest minority, since 1946.  When blue dog Democrats are added to the Republicans on certain issues like gun control or marriage, the Republican majority is even greater than in 1946.
Democratic loses could be attributed to public rejection of the socialistic policies of the Obama administration. The public disapproved of President Obama's economic policies. In the days leading up to the election, a majority of voters supported repealing/replacing The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, sixty-five percent of voters said that the economic stimulus package either hurt the economy or did no good,[2] and fifty-four percent of those voting said they were dissatisfied with the performance of Barack Obama. Given the high level of Democratic success in the 2006 and 2008 elections, they were also put in the position of having to defend a large number of seats.
John Boehner (R-Ohio), become Speaker of the House in the 112th Congress, exchanging places with Nancy Pelosi (D-California). By tradition Pelosi would be expected to resign her leadership position after such a stunning repudiation by the electorate, but as a self-centered liberal she insisted on becoming the next Minority Leader.

2009 elections
In the Nov. 3, 2009, off-year elections, defeat was the fate of Democrats in New York City, New Jersey and Virginia. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent, spent his way to a third term in New York City while Republican Bob McDonnell won in a landslide for governor of Virginia; in New Jersey Republican Christopher Christie ousted the incumbent Democrat Jon Corzine despite his millions and Obama's campaigning.
Conservatives scored a major internal party victory in Oct. 2009 by forcing the Republican candidate Dede Scozzafava out of a House race in New York's 23rd district, for being too liberal. The Conservative Party candidate was defeated by the Democrat, however, opening up recriminations between GOP officials and conservatives on why the district was lost for the first time since 1992. Conservative activists zeroed in on the 2010 race for Florida's open Senate seat, in which the Republican party Senate campaign committee endorsed moderate Gov. Charlie Crist but the more conservative Marco Rubio mounted a successful challenge. ""If I were Charlie Crist in Florida, what's happening in New York 23 would make me extremely nervous,"" GOP strategist Todd Harris said. ""A lot of the establishment Republicans underestimated the grass-roots anger across the country about spending and the expansion of the federal government. The anger is boiling over now, but a lot of the seeds of discontent were planted over the last five to six years.""[3]

Ad campaigns
 Cartoonist Michael Ramirez of Investor's Business Daily captures the tone of the 2010 Midterm elections.
In late 2009 national money was being poured into nine districts, where Democrats who voted for their party's health care reform may be in trouble. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, representing business, has spent at least $1.6 million in November.  Liberals shoot back against the Chamber and 60 Plus Association with ads targeting 12 Democrats and one Republican who supported health reform. Three liberal groups, Americans United for Change and the labor unions AFSCME and SEIU are teaming up for $1.75 million worth of counter-messaging on broadcast and cable TV in the districts of Reps. Berry, Cao, Connolly, Donnelly, Ellsworth, Hill, Hodes, Michaud, Murphy, Perriello, Pomeroy, Snyder and Titus.
In mid-October the Democratic National Committee, echoing charges debunked[4] by the New York Times, insinuated that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce was using ""foreign money"" to fund ads criticizing Democrats. The president said in a Maryland stump speech, ""we learned that one of the largest groups paying for these ads regularly takes in money from foreign corporations. So groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence American elections, and they won't tell you where the money for their ads comes from…. This is a threat to our democracy."" 
The president himself has received $543,219 from Swiss banking giant UBS AG,[5] a foreign banking corporation which was later fined a record $780 million for its part in helping the rich evade U.S. income taxes.[6] Columnist Ruben Navarrette warned the pitfalls of playing the ""foreign card"" is



 “

 both offensive and dangerous. It exploits people's fears of the unknown and appeals to the prejudice that many of us feel toward those who are different. It also fuels ugly nativist instincts that -- once unleashed -- can do real damage....Democrats know this better than anyone ... The birther movement, which suggests that Obama was actually born in Kenya and thus not eligible to serve as a president, is all about playing the foreign card...[7]

 ”


Commentator Charles Krauthammer called the unfounded attacks on the Chamber of Commerce a baseless McCarthyite smear,[8] while columinst Jacob Sullum wrote,



 “

 Obama's attempt to discredit his opponents by linking them to sinister outsiders reminds us that neither major party has a monopoly on xenophobia. To some extent, crying ""foreigner"" reflects the president's desperation in the face of the Democrats' looming midterm losses.[9]

 ”


Pre-election Forecasts
In recent years, as the chart shows, the incumbent party loses an average of 16 House seats.  The GOP needed 39 seats to win back the House.  
Democrats had to defend about 60 marginal House seats in 2010, as opposed to about 40 for Republicans. At high risk were 27 Democratic seats and just 13 Republican seats that may see a party switch.
Election forecasters in September 2009 were revising their predictions downward for the Democrats, as Obama's popularity continues to plunge. From April to August, Obama lost 10 points across the board—suffering losses in every group except blacks, who remain loyal to him.[10] The popularity of Congress remains low. Starting in January 2010 the number of Americans who identify themselves as Democrats was at a seven-year low.[11] The Republican party, however, suffers from a lack of leaders and its own poor reputation in voter esteem.
""No question, August proved cathartic for voters and chaotic for congressional Democrats. But way before the town hall meetings during recess, there were ample signs for Democrats to fear for their careers in 2010,"" concluded Cook Political Report House analyst David Wasserman, who predicts the Democrats will lose 20 seats in the House, but retain control.[12]  Wasserman concludes that a major shift has been underway among ""angry white seniors"" (over age 60), who strongly dislike the Obama health care proposals because they fear they will lose benefits they now have. 
Analyst Stuart Rothenberg reported that, ""Growing public concern about spending, taxes and the size of government has started to shift the national landscape away from the Democrats to a more neutral position, and quite possibly toward the GOP.""[13] Furthermore, an advantage for Republicans was that 48 House Democrats, 8 more than the size of their majority, come from districts that voted for both George W. Bush and John McCain.[14]
Columnist Rich Galen observed,



 “

 He railroaded his signature legislation - Obamacare - through the Congress costing his party 60+ seats in the 2010 mid-term election and guaranteeing GOP control of the House for the foreseeable future. Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi will go down in history as enablers of the sacrifice of Obama's Congressional allies on the alter of his enormous ego.[15]

 ”

Senate
Texas Senator John Cornyn, the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, quietly put Senate Republicans in a position to benefit as the national political environment went negative toward Democrats, and was successful in narrowing the Democratic majority. Without losing any of their seats, the Republican Party defeated two incumbents, Blanche Lincoln (D-Arkansas) and Russ Feingold (D-Wisconsin), and won four Democratic-held open seats: Illinois, Indiana, North Dakota, and Pennsylvania. Additionally, Republican Scott Brown was elected to replace the late Senator Ted Kennedy (D-Massachusetts) in a January special election.  

Republican Gains
Arkansas
Moderate Democrat Blanche Lincoln was defeated by 21 percentage points after Republicans made her one of their top targets in 2010. In the 2008 Presidential Election, Arkansas was one of the few states where John McCain exceeded George W. Bush’s margin, despite the national trend favoring Democrats. Generally, she voted the party line with President Obama, which angered her conservative constituents, but also voted against the Employee Free Choice Act (card check) and opposed to the public option in health care, which angered liberals. She began airing TV ads in March touting her independence from President Obama and national Democrats. Lincoln defeated Lieutenant Governor Bill Halter in a close runoff for the Democratic nomination.
Third district Congressman John Boozman easily won the Republican nomination, defeating State Senator Gilbert Baker and former State Senator Jim Holt. Boozman comfortably led thoughout the entire campaign.

Indiana
Two-term Democrat Evan Bayh dropped out of his reelection in February after polls showed he may be vulnerable after his vote for the economic stimulus package and government-run health care. Former Republican U.S. Senator Dan Coats, who predeced Bayh after retiring in 1998, announced his candidacy for his old Senate seat. Former six-term Congressman John Hostettler, State Senator Marlin Stutzman and businessman Don Bates Jr. were defeated for the Republican nomination. Conservative Congressman Mike Pence considered running, but instead chose to seek reelection in the House.
8th district Congressman Brad Ellsworth was the Democratic nominee. Dan Coats defeated Ellsworth by a 55%-40% margin. Ellsworth supported President Obama’s health care plan in a state where opposition to the legislation is higher than it was nationally.[16]

Illinois
Democratic Senator Roland Burris had been plagued by controversies. Burris was appointed to replace Barack Obama by Governor Rod Blagojevich, who had been arrested on a variety of federal corruption charges (including for trying to ""sell"" Obama's Senate seat). Burris was then accused of committing perjury after he admitted to not testifying truthfully at a committee investigating Governor Blagojevich. Burris announced he would not seek a full term in 2010.
Moderate-GOP Congressman Mark Kirk, representing a Democratic-leaning district that covers suburban Chicago, easily won the Republican nomination, while Illinois State Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias defeated Chicago Inspector General David Hoffman in a close primary. Both candidates faced negative media publicity, Giannoulias for the collapse of his family bank, and Kirk for exaggerating his military record. In the general election, Kirk defeated Giannoulias by a 48%-46% margin.

Massachusetts
Republican State Senator Scott Brown pulled a major upset when he defeated Attorney General Martha Coakley by a 52%-47% margin.
Liberal icon Ted Kennedy, the third longest-serving Senator in U.S. history, died in August 2009, marking the end of an era. During the 2004 Presidential Election the Democratic super-majority in the state legislator blocked the right of Republican Governor Mitt Romney to appoint an interim senator had John Kerry been elected President. After changing the law to allow Governor Deval Patrick, a Democrat, the right to appoint a temporary replacement for Kennedy, he choose former Democratic National Committee chairman Paul Kirk. He did not seek a full term of his own, and a special election was held on January 19, 2010. 
State Attorney General Martha Coakley won the Democratic primary, defeating businessman Alan Khazei, Representative Mike Capuano, and Boston Celtics co-owner Stephen Pagliuca. Charismatic State Senator Scott Brown was the Republican nominee.[17]

 a last minute appeal
It was a safe Democratic seat until January, when Democrats reeled in shock as Coakley lost her 30-point lead and trailed by 5-10 points in the closing hours. Coakley was an ineffective machine-style insider candidate who was unable to reach independents. Brown's main theme was that he would be the 41st senator and would block the Obama health care plan—which Massachusetts did not need, he explained, because it had its own plan in operation. Coakley responded by attacking bankers and bringing in big guns like Bill Clinton, John Kerry and Barack Obama. They appealed to regular Democrats and alienated the equally numerous independents, who preferred Brown by more than 2-1. 
The defeat for Coakley, coming on the heels of the Democrats' loss of Virginia and New Jersey in Nov. 2009, was a major blow to the liberal caused and reinvigorated the Republican party nationally.

North Dakota
Byron Dorgan, a three-term Democrat Senator from North Dakota, announced he would not seek reelection. Dorgan's announcement represented an opportunity for Republicans, after popular Governor John Hoeven announced his candidacy.[18] Hoeven defeated State Senator Tracy Potter by a 76%-22% margin, carrying every county.

Pennsylvania
After polls showed him losing the Republican primary by as much as 20 points, Arlen Specter simply changed party affiliation to Democrat. Despite full support by President Obama and virtually every elected Democrat in Pennsylvania as well as nearly every major newspaper, Specter went on to lose the Democratic nomination to 7th-district Congressman Joe Sestak in the primary, and faced former 15th district Congressman and Club for Growth President Pat Toomey, known for his economic conservatism. In the general election, Toomey defeated Sestak by a 51%-49% margin.

Wisconsin
Three-term incumbent Russ Feingold had positioned himself for a comfortable reelection after former governor and Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson announced he would not run. However, Tea Party activist and Oshkosh businessman Ron Johnson defeated Feingold by a 52%-47% margin.

Democratic Holds
California
Although California is a solidly Democratic state, conservatives originally saw outspoken liberal Senator Barbara Boxer as vulnerable. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was term-limited in 2010, announced he would not run. Former Hewlett-Packard Company President Carly Fiorina defeated former U.S. Rep. Tom Campbell and Assemblyman Chuck DeVore in the Republican primary. Boxer defeated Fiorina by ten percentage points.

Colorado
Appointed Democratic Senator Michael Bennet was narrowly reelected. Former Speaker of the Colorado House of Representatives Andrew Romanoff was defeated in his bid to challenge Bennet for the Democratic nomination, while Weld County District Attorney Ken Buck defeated former Lieutenant Governor Jane Norton in the Republican primary. 

Connecticut
30-year Senate veteran Chris Dodd announced he would not seek a sixth term. Dodd's approval ratings plummeted after his failed presidential campaign in 2008, his controversial mortgage deal from Countrywide, and revelations about the $165 million bonuses for AIG executives that he attached in an amendment to the economic stimulus package, despite receiving federal bailout money. Popular state Attorney General Richard Blumenthal won the Democratic nomination, increasing the Democrats' chances of holding the seat. However, his poll numbers dropped after a New York Times report revealed that he exaggerated his military record.
Republicans nominated World Wrestling Entertainment CEO Linda McMahon, defeating former Congressman Rob Simmons and libertarian-leaning economist Peter Schiff, a stock broker and adviser to Ron Paul’s 2008 presidential campaign. Blumenthal won the general election by a 55%-43% margin.

Delaware
Joe Biden was simultaneously elected to a seventh term in the Senate and Vice President at the same time. Democratic Governor Ruth Ann Minner appointed a ""caretaker"" Senator, Ted Kaufman. Michael Castle, a moderate Republican who also served as Governor and Lieutenant Governor, was heavily favored to win the Republican nomination. However, Tea Party backed insurgent Christine O’Donnell ousted Castle in the primary, improving New Castle County Executive Chris Coons chances in holding the seat for Democrats. The Republican Party had a mixed reaction to O’Donnell's victory. She had caused controversy regarding her views on creationism and Christian values. Coons defeated O’Donnell by a 57%-40% margin.

Hawaii
Democrat Daniel Inouye easily won reelection against Republican Representative Campbell Cavasso.

Maryland
Entrenched incumbent Barbara Mikulski easily won reelection, defeating physician and Queen Anne's County Commissioner Eric Wargotz.

Nevada
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid faced a competitive reelection in 2010. The ""Cook Political Report"" in September 2009 rateed the contest as ""Toss Up."" His status weakened in summer 2009, as discontent with President Obama and the Democrats' health plan mounted, and as the Recession of 2008 continues to batter Las Vegas and the entire Nevada economy, with no relief in sight from the stimulus bill Reid pushed through the Senate. Reid's inability to improve his standing in the polls, coupled with the deteriorating political environment for Democrats nationally, were clear indications that his political problems are deep and will be difficult (though not impossible) to fix, says Cook. 
After receiving the endorsement of the Tea Party Express and Club for Growth, former Assemblywoman Sharron Angle defeated former State Senator Sue Lowden and businessman Danny Tarkanian in the Republican primary. Reid defeated Angle by a 50%-45% margin.

New York
Senior Senator Charles Schumer was considered the safest incumbent of 2010 and won his reelection by a 66%-33% margin against Republican Jay Townsend.

New York-Special Election
Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand was appointed by Governor David Patterson to replace Hillary Clinton after much confusion on his part. Patterson mishandled the proposed appointment of Caroline Kennedy, gaining ridicule for both of them.  Gillibrand's moderate views alienated the left wing of the Democratic Party. Former Tennessee Congressman Harold Ford, Jr. has announced he will not seek a primary challenge to Gillibrand.
Nine-term Congressman Peter King has declined to run. Republicans are tried but failed to recruit former Governor George Pataki, who ran ahead in the polls with Gillibrand. Real estate billionaire Mort Zuckerman, despite having a record of supporting liberal causes, was mentioned as a possible Republican or Independent candidate to avoid a primary, however announced that he would not run. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani declined to seek the Senate seat.[19] Instead, Republicans nominated former Congressman Joseph DioGuardi, whom Gillibrand defeated by a 62%-36% margin.

Oregon
Democratic Senator Ron Wyden defeated his Republican challenger, Lewis & Clark College law professor Jim Huffman by a 57%-39% margin. 

Vermont
Patrick Leahy, the third most senior U.S. Senator, was reelected by a 64%-40% margin against Republican Len Britton.

Washington
Polls show that Senator Patty Murray, once considered well positioned for reelection, would face a competitive race against Washington's former state Senator, Dino Rossi. In November, Murray defeated Rossi by a 52%-48% margin.

West Virginia
Popular Democratic Governor Joe Manchin was elected to replace the late Exalted Cyclops Senator Robert Byrd. Businessman and 2006 nominee John Raese made the race surprisingly close by tying Manchin to the Obama administration.

Republican Holds

Alaska 
Lisa Murkowski won a term for the U.S. Senate in her own right in 2004 by a close 48%-45% margin, however, in 2010 she lost the Primary Election against Joe Miller, a Conservative candidate and Tea Party favorite. Democrats nominated Sitka, Alaska Mayor Scott McAdams. Murkowski pursued her campaign as a write-in candidate, and was reelected with a 39% plurality, while Miller received 35% and McAdams 23%. She has the distinction of being the first person elected to the Senate via write-in since Strom Thurmond in 1954. 

Arizona
Senior Senator John McCain, the Republicans presidential nominee in 2008, caught a break when Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano was appointed Secretary of Homeland Security. However, former Congressman J. D. Hayworth challenged McCain in a primary, but was defeated by a 56%-32% margin. McCain went on to defeat Tucson City Councilor Rodney Glassman by a 59%-35% margin. 

Florida
Republican Governor Charlie Crist, who once enjoyed high approval ratings, appointed George LeMieux upon the resignation of Senator Mel Martinez. LeMieux held the seat temporarily for Governor Crist who decided to run for the Senate. He was the establishment pick for the Republican nomination, but was challenged by conservative Florida House Speaker and Tea Party backed candidate Marco Rubio, who led by 32 points according to Public Policy Polling.[20] Crist announced he would drop out of the Republican primary and run as an Independent. 
Crist alienated conservatives when he campaigned with President Obama in support for the $787 billion economic stimulus package, which was entirely opposed by the Florida Republican federal delegation. Democrats nominated 17th district Congressman Kendrick Meek, who defeated billionaire businessman Jeff Greene. Rubio was elected with a 49% plurality, defeating Crist who received 30% and Meek who received 20%. 

Georgia

Idaho
Mike Crapo's conservative voting record goes along with the Republican stronghold of Idaho. In 2004, he faced no Democratic challenger and won reelection with over 99% of the vote. Crapo's seat was one of the safest in the 2010 election cycle, and he won reelection by a 71%-25% margin.

Iowa
30-year incumbent Charles Grassley is one of the most distinguished and influential Republican Senators in Washington (he serves as ranking member of the Finance Committee). He was reelected by a 65%-33% margin against former U.S. Attorney Roxanne Conlin, carrying all but one county.

Kansas
Incumbent Republican Sam Brownback honored his campaign pledge to serve only two terms. 1st district Congressman Jerry Moran defeated 4th district Congressman Todd Tiahrt for the Republican nomination by a 50%-45% margin, while Democrats nominated Lisa Johnston, an administrator at Baker University.

Paul campaigned on a reducation in taxion and spending, and won the support of conservatives and libertarians alike. Paul defeated Conway by a 56%-44% margin.

Louisiana
Louisiana, a conservative state, was not effected by the national trend for Democrats in 2006 and 2008. Republican Bobby Jindal was elected Governor by a landslide in 2007, in 2008 John McCain received a larger margin of victory in the state than George W. Bush in 2004, while the GOP gained two House seats from the Democrats. Yet first-term Republican David Vitter was considered to be vulnerable for his reelection after he confessed in 2007 to seeing an escort service, which has tainted his career. Third-district Congressman Charlie Melancon won the Democratic nomination. Vitter defeated Melancon by a 57%-38% margin.

Missouri
Incumbent Republican Senator Kit Bond announced he will not seek fifth term. Former House Majority Whip Roy Blunt announced his candidacy.

BLunt defeated Carnahan by a 54%-41% margin.

New Hampshire
Senior Republican Senator Judd Gregg, after withdrawing from a position in the Obama administration, announced he will not seek a fourth term. 2nd district Congressman Paul Hodes won the Democratic nomination, while Republicans nominated former New Hampshire Attorney General Kelly Ayotte. Ayotte defeated Hodes by a 60%-37% margin.

North Carolina
First-term Republican Richard Burr was considered vulnerable after Barack Obama won North Carolina's 15 electoral votes by a narrow margin, and Democrat Kay Hagan defeated Republican Senator Elizabeth Dole. It is also worth noting that no Senator has held this seat for more than one term since 1974. Secretary of State Elaine Marshall defeated former State Senator Cal Cunningham and Attorney Ken Lewis in the Democratic primary. Burr was reelected by a 55%-43% margin.

Ohio
Moderate Republican George Voinovich announced he would not seek a third term. Lieutenant Governor Lee Fisher won the Democratic nomination over Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner with 55% of the vote, a much closer margin than polls had shown.[22] Fisher received the endorsement of Democratic Governor Ted Strickland. Meanwhile, Republicans rallied behind Rob Portman, former Congressman and Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Although polls originally showed a tight race, Portman defeated Fisher by a 57%-39% margin.

Oklahoma
Tom Coburn was elected to a second term by a 71%-26% margin against Democrat Jim Rogers.

South Carolina
First-term Republican Jim DeMint, whose reputation as an outspoken conservative, has not hurt him in the Republican stronghold of South Carolina. Democrats nominated an unconventional candidate, Alvin Greene, an unemployed Army veteran who was indicted on criminal charges for showing pornographic pictures to a teenage college student.[23] DeMint defeated Greene by a 61%-28% margin.  

South Dakota
In 2004, John Thune defeated Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, and his victory quickly made him a rising star in the Republican Party. Thune ran unopposed in his reelection.[24]

Utah 
Three-term Senator Robert Bennett represents a state that John McCain won by over thirty-percentage points and was expected to win reelection by a comfortable margin. However, he was defeated in the Republican caucus to Mike Lee and Tim Bridgewater after his vote for TARP. Bennett ruled out a write-in campaign, and Lee went on to win the Republican primary and general election.

Governors
In the 2010 gubernatorial elections, the Democratic Party won five governorships held by retiring Republicans: California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Minnesota, and Vermont. The Republican Party won nine governorships from retiring Democrats: Kansas, Oklahoma, Maine, Michigan, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Wisconsin, Wyoming, and defeated two incumbents, Chet Culver of Iowa and Ted Strickland of Ohio. An Independent was elected Governor of Rhode Island to replace a retiring Republican, and a Republican was elected Governor of Florida to replace an Independent. Thus, Republicans had a net gain of six governorships, and the majority of Governors in the United States flipped from Democrat to Republican. Republicans also won the governorships of New Jersey and Virginia from the Democrats in the 2009 elections.

Democratic Gains
California
Incumbent Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger was prohibited from seeking reelection because of term-limits. Schwarzenegger was elected in 2003 after a recall of Governor Gray Davis and reelected in a landslide in 2006. However, Schwarzenegger's popularity, along with the Democratic assembly, fell because of the California budget crisis. State Attorney General and former Governor Jerry Brown won the Democratic nomination. On the Republican side, former Ebay CEO Meg Whitman defeated State Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner.

Connecticut
M. Jodi Rell, despite being a Republican Governor from a blue state, was reelected with 63% of the vote in 2006 and had high approval ratings throughout her tenure as governor.

Minnesota
Two-term Governor Tim Pawlenty announced he would not seek another term, and became a potential 2012 GOP presidential candidate. Republican State Representative Tom Emmer and former Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Dayton won their parties nominations, respectively. After a recount, Dayton was confirmed to have won by a 0.5% margin.  

Vermont
Although a solidly Democratic state (Barack Obama won it with over 67% of the vote) Republican Jim Douglas was elected governor in 2002 and reelected in 2004, 2006, and 2008. Douglas announced he would not run for another term, and Republicans nominated Lieutenant Governor Brian Dubie. Democratic State Senator Peter Shumlin defeated Dubie by a 50%-48% margin in the general election.

Independent Gains
Rhode Island
Although Democrats have dominated Rhode Island politics, they have voted Republican for 7 of the last 10 gubernatorial elections. As Rhode Island was hit hard by the national recession, Republican Governor Donald Carcieri suffered in the polls, and was barred from seeking a third term because of term-limits. Lincoln Chafee, former Senator who was known as the most liberal Republican in Congress, was elected Governor as an Independent, defeating Republican John Robitaille and Democrat Frank Caprio. After President Obama refused to endorse Caprio, he caused controversy by telling Obama to take his endorsement and ""shove it."" [27]

Republican Gains
Florida
Republican turned Independent Governor Charlie Crist announced he would not seek a second term and instead run for the United States Senate, resulting in an open race. State Attorney General Bill McCollum was heavily favored to win the Republican nomination, but was defeated by Rick Scott, a millionaire health care executive and activist against federal health care legislation. Democrats nominated Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink, who led Scott in most of the polls following the primary. Scott's campaign emphasized conservative policies such as expanding school choice, abolishing the corporate income tax, and firing state employees.[28] He won the general election by a narrow 49%-48% margin. 

Iowa
Chet Culver, who was elected governor in 2006 riding on a Democratic wave, was defeated in a competitive reelection.

Former Governor Terry Branstad defeated Culver by a 53%-43% margin.

Kansas
Kathleen Sebelius, a Democratic Governor from the Republican-stronghold of Kansas, stepped down after being nominated to serve as Secretary of Health and Human Services in the Obama administration.

Senator Sam Brownback was the Republican nominee, and defeated Democratic state Senator Tom Holland by a 63%-32% margin.

Maine
Democrat Governor John Baldacci was term-limited by state law, and Republicans saw it as an opportunity to gain the governorship. Republicans nominated Waterville, Maine Mayor Paul LePage, who defeated Independent candidate Eliot Cutler and Democratic state Senate President Libby Mitchell with a 38% plurarly. 

Michigan
Democratic Governor Jennifer Granholm suffered in her job approval ratings as the Michigan economy, heavily dependent of the auto industry, continued to falter throughout the 2000s.

Rick Snyder, easily defeated Democrat Lansing Mayor Virgil Bernero by a 58%-40% margin in the general election.

New Mexico
Democratic Governor Bill Richardson was nominated by President Obama to serve as Secretary of Commerce, however was forced to resign after it was exposed that his administration had a ""pay-to-play"" deal with a defense contractor.

The Republican nomination went to District Attorney Susana Martinez, and narrowly led in the polls throughout the campaign. She defeated Denish by a 54%-46% margin, becoming the first Hispanic woman elected governor in the United States. 

Ohio
Incumbent Democrat Ted Strickland faced sagging approval ratings and tough reelection prospects as Ohio lost jobs and population during his governorship. His Republican opponent, John Kasich – a former Congressman and Chairman of the House Budget Committee in the 1990s – campaigned on phasing out the state income tax, leasing the state's toll roads, cutting 15-20 percent of the state's higher education funds, and relaxing sentences on nonviolent offenders to cut down prison costs.[30] He defeated Strickland by a 49%-47% margin.

Oklahoma

Pennsylvania
Democratic Governor Ed Rendell was term limited in 2010. Democrats nominated Allegheny County Chief Executive Dan Onorato.

Democratic Holds
Arkansas
Centrist Democrat Mike Beebe enjoyed high approval ratings throughout his tenure as Governor. He was reelected by a 65%-34% margin against former Republican State Senate Jim Keet, despite Republicans making strong inroads in the traditionally Democratic supporting Arkansas during the 2010 election.

Colorado 
Despite Democratic success in Colorado during the 2006 and 2008 elections, incumbent Governor Bill Ritter announced his retirement after the prospects of a difficult reelection. His policies of higher taxes and unionization of state employees earned him criticism from the business community, and his approval ratings fell to 45%.[31] Former Congressman Scott McInnis was favored to win the Republican nomination, however fell in the polls after a controversy regarding plagiarizing an article, and was defeated by businessman and political newcomer Dan Maes, who also received criticism for misrepresenting his law enforcement background in the 1980s. Meanwhile, former Congressman Tom Tancredo entered the race in the American Constitution Party, and surged towards the end of the campaign. The turmoil made is easier for Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper to hold the Governors office for the Democrats, and was elected 50% of the vote, to Tancredo's 37% and Maes 11%.

Illinois
Democratic Governor Pat Quinn was installed as governor after the impeachment of Rod Blagojevich, and announced he would seek a full term. Quinn narrowly won the Democratic nomination against State Comptroller Dan Hynes. State Senator Bill Brady won the Republican nomination, defeating State Senator Kirk Dillard, and former State GOP chair Andrew McKenna. In the general election, Quinn pulled somewhat of an upset, winning reelection by a 47%-46% margin.  

Maryland
Democrat Martin O'Malley will likely run for a second term in 2010. O'Malley's approval ratings fell to 33% after a series of tax increases. The race was expected to be competitive with former Governor Robert Ehrlich seeking a rematch, however O'Malley was reelected by 14 percentage points.    

Massachusetts
Deval Patrick, although a Democratic Governor from a blue state, faced a difficult reelection after a disappointing performance as governor. The Republican nominee was health care executive Charlie Baker. Patrick was reelected with a 48% plurality, with Baker receiving 42% and Independent Paul Loscocco 8%.

New York
After Democratic Governor Eliot Spitzer resigned in disgrace when it was revealed that he was involved in a prostitution ring, Lieutenant Governor David Paterson took office.

Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani declined to seek the governorship and endorsed former Congressman Rick Lazio. 
President Barack Obama in Sept. 2009 contacted Paterson, asking him not to seek reelection in 2010 in that he cannot recover from his dismal political standing. Democrats nominated a stronger candidate, State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo. Republicans nominated Tea Party favorite and real estate developer Carl Paladino. Polls originally showed a tightening race, however a series of missteps resulted in Cuomo being handedly elected with over 60-percent of the vote.

Arizona 
After Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano was nominated by President Obama to serve as Secretary of Homeland Security, Arizona Secretary of State Janice K. Brewer, a Republican, succeeded her. She announced that she would seek a full term.[33] In the beginning of 2010, Brewer was considered to be one of the most vulnerable Republican Governors up for reelection. However, her popularity rose after signing a controversial illegal immigration law, and was reelected against state Attorney General Terry Goddard by a 55%-42% margin.

Georgia
In 2002, Sonny Perdue became the first Republican elected Governor of Georgia since reconstruction, and was reelected in 2006. However, he was term-limited in 2010.

"
1970 Midterm Elections,https://www.conservapedia.com/1970_Midterm_Elections,"In the midterm elections of 1970, the Democratic Party gained 12 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives while Republicans gained two seats in the U.S. Senate. Democrats retained their majorities in both houses of Congress. Democrats also gained ten governorships.
President Nixon set the tone of the campaign on morality, law and order and denouncing antiwar protesters. Democrats focused on the economy, with unemployment and inflation at 6-percent. Democrats increased their majority in the House by a dozen seats. Republicans fared better in the upper chamber, defeating three Democratic Senators, including Al Gore Sr. of Tennessee. Conservative Party candidate James Buckley defeated liberal Republican Charles E. Goodell and the Democratic challenger in New York.



"
17th Amendment,https://www.conservapedia.com/17th_Amendment,"The Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which called for the direct election of Senators, states:



 “

 The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, elected by the people thereof, for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote. The electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures.
When vacancies happen in the representation of any State in the Senate, the executive authority of such State shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies: Provided, That the legislature of any State may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments until the people fill the vacancies by election as the legislature may direct.
This amendment shall not be so construed as to affect the election or term of any Senator chosen before it becomes valid as part of the Constitution.


 ”



The Seventeenth Amendment was ratified in 1913 during the progressive era of Woodrow Wilson. The Seventeenth Amendment replaces the process of elected state legislatures picking U.S. Senators–and the Senators adhering to the principles of those elected legislatures–with a process of electing Senators by a majority vote of the people within a state, a shift in policy from the Founding Fathers Constitutional Republic to a form of direct Democracy. Consequently, the Seventeenth Amendment reduces the influence of state legislatures over United States Senators.  Some people claim that this leaves Senators more subject to influnce from  special interest groups (Lobbyists, Unions and Corporations), because Senators must raise funds for their expensive re-election campaigns.  
There are two impacting differences in the election and legislative process with the addition of the Seventeenth Amendment: (1) the people of a state vote for a Senator rather than the elected state legislatures, and (2) upon confirmation of an elected Senator, they are no longer under the influence of the people who elected them, nor the state legislatures, but are controlled by special interest groups otherwise known as ""Mob Rule,"" or rule by the majority. The long-term impact of the Seventeenth Amendment modified America's Constitutional Republic by fundamentally transforming it into a more progressive form of democracy, sometimes referred to as a ""democratic Republic"" by Public Union teachers, and of which has essentially reduced the people's protections under Constitutional Law by giving more power to the voters.  
Before the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment, the Senate was comprised of senators selected by state legislatures rather than elected by the people, and they legislature refused for years to pass this amendment. With the help of Woodrow Wilson's methodical, effective but destructive use of propaganda, the states resorted to an alternative mechanism for amendment, bypassing Congress and passing resolutions that called for a constitutional convention. When nearly enough states (2/3rd of the United States) had passed resolutions for a constitutional convention, the Senate averted a constitutional convention by finally passing the Seventeenth Amendment and sending it to the states for ratification.
The amendment has been criticized by some for eroding the principle of Federalism that the Constitution was based on.  On the other hand, the proponents of the amendment claim that the prior system allowed for Senators to buy the votes of the legislators that elected them.

Background
The process of senators being selected by the state legislatures seemed to work well until the mid-1850s. At that time, growing hostilities in various states resulted in vacant Senate seats. In Indiana, for example, the conflict between Democrats in the southern half of the state and the emerging Republican Party in the northern half prevented the election of any candidate, thereby leaving the Senate seat vacant for two years. This marked the beginning of many contentious battles in state legislatures, as the struggle to elect senators reflected the increasing tensions over slavery and states' rights which led to the Civil War. After the Civil War, problems in senatorial elections by the state legislatures multiplied. In one case in the late 1860s, the election of Senator John Stockton of New Jersey was contested on the grounds that he had been elected by a plurality rather than a majority in the state legislature. Stockton based his defense on the observation that not all states elected their senators in the same way, and presented a report that illustrated the inconsistency in state elections of senators. In response, Congress passed a law in 1866 regulating how and when senators were elected in each state. First, a voice vote would be taken in each house. If there was no overwhelming choice, then a concurrent vote would be taken. This process revealed information about voting preferences to minority cliques within the legislatures, who then knew who they had to support or oppose. This was the first change in the process of senatorial elections created by the Founders. The law helped but did not entirely solve the problem, and deadlocks in some legislatures continued to cause long vacancies in some Senate seats. Intimidation and bribery marked some of the states' selection of senators. Nine bribery cases were brought before the Senate between 1866 and 1906. In addition, forty-five deadlocks occurred in twenty states between 1891 and 1905, resulting in numerous delays in seating senators. So the American people said that we need more democracy, and left-wing muckraking journalists gave out calls for supporting the 16th and 17th amendments as well as the Federal Reserve. [1]

Calls for Repeal
At least three U.S. Senators have called for the repeal of the 17th Amendment: Jeff Flake (R-AZ), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Senators Mike Lee (R-UT).  In addition, former Governors Rick Perry and Mike Huckabee have also called for its repeal.[2]

1821 Treaty of Chicago,https://www.conservapedia.com/1821_Treaty_of_Chicago,"The 1821 Treaty of Chicago was a treaty signed by Michigan territorial governor Lewis Cass and Solomon Sibley for the United States and representatives of the Ottawa, Ojibwe, and Potawatomi on August 29, 1821. It gave the United States all land in Michigan Territory aouth of the Grand River.

Text of the 1821 Treaty of Chicago
ARTICLE I. The Ottawa, Chippewa, and Pottawatamie, Nations of Indians cede to the United States all the Land comprehended within the following boundaries: Beginning at a point on the south bank of the river St. Joseph of Lake Michigan, near the Parc aux Vaches, due north from Rum's Village, and running thence south to a line drawn due east from the southern extreme of Lake Michigan, thence with the said line east to the Tract ceded by the Pottawatamies to the United States by the Treaty of Fort Meigs in 1817, if the said line should strike the said Tract, but if the said line should pass north of the said Tract, then such line shall be continued until it strikes the western boundary of the Tract ceded to the United States by the Treaty of Detroit in 1807, and from the termination of the said line, following the boundaries of former cessions, to the main branch of the Grand River of Lake Michigan, should any of the said lines cross the said River, but if none of the said lines should cross the said River, then to a point due east of the source of the said main branch of the said river, and from such point due west to the source of the said principal branch, and from the crossing of the said River, or from the source thereof, as the case may be, down the said River, on the north bank thereof, to the mouth; thence following the shore of Lake Michigan to the south bank of the said river St. Joseph, at the mouth thereof, and thence with the said south bank to the place of beginning.

Gabrielle Giffords (born June 8, 1970 in Tucson, Arizona) is a former Democratic U.S. Representative from Arizona's 8th congressional district, serving from 2006 to 2012. Giffords was the main target of the 2011 Tucson Shootings and was wounded in the attack. She resigned from the House of Representatives in January 2012 to focus on her recovery.

Backround
Giffords attended Cornell University and Scripps College in California. She was elected to the Arizona State House in 2000, and two years later became the youngest woman ever elected to the Arizona Senate. Giffords is married to astronaut Mark E. Kelly, who has piloted space shuttles Endeavour and Discovery. The two met in China in 2003 while they were serving on a committee there, and were married in January 2007. [1] Giffords was elected to the House of Representatives in 2006 and was a Blue Dog Democrat. She is pro-choice, a supporter of solar energy, and voted in favor of ObamaCare.[1] She was a member of the Armed Services Committee, Foreign Affairs Committee, and the Science and Technology Committee.

2011 Tucson Shooting
On January 8, 2011, she was shot along with at least 17 others by a gunman while holding a public event outside of a grocery store in Tucson. [2] U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona will survive being shot in the head by a man who opened fire at her community meeting in Tucson, killing six people including a federal judge. [3] [4] Reports are confirming that an aide to the congresswoman and a federal judge, John Roll were killed in the attack. [5]
Latino Daniel Hernandez, Gabrielle Giffords' new 5-day intern may have saved her. Many are praising the actions of Hernandez, who was standing near Giffords when she was shot in the head. He had only been her intern for five days, but rushed to her side when she went down, held her head in his lap and applied consistent pressure to the wound. He is a junior at the University of Arizona and he also advised others what to do with the other wounded people while they waited for help to arrive, according to MSNBC. 
Hernandez had taken some first aid courses in high school but he is being hailed as heroic for his actions on Saturday.
The way that she was communicating was by grabbing my hand,"" Hernandez says. ""I would ask her a question and she would squeeze my hand in a way to acknowledge that she was still conscious and awake and still able to hear what I was saying.""
[6]
Using his hand, Hernandez applied pressure to the entry wound on her forehead. He pulled her into his lap, holding her upright against him so she wouldn’t choke on her own blood. Giffords was conscious, but quiet. The fact that Hernandez was nearby and able to react quickly probably saved Giffords’ life, said state Rep. Matt Heinz, D-Tucson, and a hospital physician. 


On January 8, 2011, Giffords and at least 17 people, 6 of whom are reported dead, were shot at Giffords' ""Congress on Your Corner"" event [7], including three members of the Democratic congresswoman's staff in Arizona. She was shot by 22 year-old Jared Lee Loughner. Six have died, including one of Giffords' aides and a 9-year-old girl. Several others are in critical condition at the University of Arizona Medical Center. [8]

1900s,https://www.conservapedia.com/1900s,"The 20th century (1901–2000) has been called ""The American Century"" and ""The Bloodiest Century"", because during most of it America was fighting wars for democracy. The 20th century was the century of World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the Iran-Iraq War, and Iraq, as well as smaller conflicts such as Rwanda and the Falkland Islands.
However, the 20th century was also a century of inventions. The electronic computer was invented in the 20th century, and popularized by pioneers like Bill Gates of Microsoft and Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak of Apple Computers. Many inventions that we take for granted today, such as antibiotics, plastic, SCUBA gear, the transistor, the microwave oven, radar, polio vaccine, the airplane, and the cellular phone appeared in the 20th Century.[1]
On the other hand, some inventions, like the telegraph and the steamship, became obsolete and all but disappeared.

In the United States of America
Notable presidents in the 20th century included Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, and Ronald Reagan, among others. 
Fox, the company in charge of Fox News, used to be called 20th Century Fox, but they changed their name shortly before the century was about to change.[2]

Independence
A major theme of the twentieth century was the decline of the worldwide empires of the previous century. Australia became independent on January 1, 1901. The end of World War 1 led to independence for several European countries such as Poland and Hungary. The following two decades saw independence for Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Iraq, among others, but the Second World war weakened the colonial powers so much that they granted independence to most of their colonies. India, Indonesia and Israel were among ten countries gaining independence in the 1940s, became independent first, followed by a dozen African states in 1960, and nearly every remaining African and Caribbean state in the two following decades. By 1980 Hong Kong (British) was the only overseas possession with more than one million inhabitants. Finally, the 1990s saw the breakup of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia – eighteen new countries were founded in a few years after forty years of European stability.
In contrast to this wave of new nations, a few countries lost their freedom. Tibet, Hyderabad and Montenegro fell to larger nations by war or politics; East Germany and South Yemen joined their larger neighbors voluntarily and peacefully.
In all, over a hundred countries had become independent by 2000.

1962 Midterm Elections,https://www.conservapedia.com/1962_Midterm_Elections,"In the midterm elections of 1962, the Democratic Party lost four seats in the U.S. House of Representatives but gained two seats in the U.S. Senate, retaining their majorities.  
Although the opposition party traditionally makes healthy gains in midterm elections, the nation rallied behind President Kennedy during the Cuban Missile Crisis, less than three weeks before the election. Two prominent Democratic freshman Senators included George McGovern of South Dakota and Birch Bayh of Indiana. Earlier in 1962 Edward Kennedy was elected to the Senate in Massachusetts in a special election. 
Every incumbent Republican in the House was reelected. They did particularly well in south, defeating a four-term Democratic Senator in Alabama. Future presidential candidates that were elected Governor included Democrats George C. Wallace of Alabama and John Connally of Texas, and Republican George Romney of Michigan. Governor Nelson Rockefeller of New York easily won a second term. 
Future President Richard M. Nixon was defeated in his campaign for Governor of California, and told the press ""You won't have Nixon to kick around any more"", announcing his retirement from politics.

"""christmas tree"" bill",https://www.conservapedia.com/%22christmas_tree%22_bill,"A ""Christmas tree bill"" is informal nomenclature for a bill on the Senate floor that attracts many, often unrelated, floor amendments, or riders. The amendments which adorn the bill may provide special benefits to various groups or interests.[1]
An example is the National Defense Authorization Act; since the bill is a must-pass issue, as it provides for funding for Operation Iraqi Freedom, members of the Democratic party have tried to tag the bill with various other amendments supporting the homosexual agenda. Bills that would be politically dangerous for members of Congress to be on record as voting against are thus especially likely to become ""Christmas tree"" bills.

The authorship attribution to the Apostle Paul is generally accepted, even among liberal theologians.  However, three portions are questioned: 10:1-22 (sometimes) and more commonly 11:2-16 and 14:34-35.  The issue with those verses is due to inconsistent manuscript placement: in some manuscripts the verses are at the end of the chapters instead of their traditional placement.
The main topic of the epistle is dealing with issues that had developed in the Corinthian congregation: notable among them are the fragmentation into various groups and the allowance of immorality among the believers.
Chapter 13 is one of the notable chapters in all the Bible, for its constant references to ""love"" (""charity"", in the King James Version).

The Campaign
Republicans pointed out that Kerry was liberal, even more so than Ted Kennedy.  Bush's popularity numbers were at a point that most Presidents would not get re-elected.  Indeed, Kerry led in the polls for most of the campaign season, but failed to get a bump from the Democratic convention, especially when confronted with strong allegations from Swift Boat veterans that his war record was exaggerated and far from heroic.  The Republican convention painted Kerry as a flip-flopper, and the Bush-Cheney ticket did receive a bounce.  Even so, with a campaign to galvanize the young people to his cause with odd slogans such as ""vote or die"", Kerry still had a slight lead heading into the election and it appeared he would win.

The Election
On election night, voter turnout was heavy, as the Democrats had hoped, but they underestimated the Republican turnout - which was heavier than expected.  Karl Rove's strategy of getting gay marriage amendment propositions on the ballot in key states helped to get out the conservative base.  Exit polling was known to be unreliable as more Democrats than Republicans agree to talk afterwards, but this election truly highlighted that.  It began to leak on the internet that Kerry had won as the polling showed that he won Ohio by 5 points.  The networks believed that Kerry was going to be the next President and all they had to do was report it as it unfolded.  In the end George W. Bush won.  At first Kerry and Edwards refused to concede and, indeed, Edwards wanted to contest the election, but there were no close states like in 2000.  Their best bet, Ohio, was won by Bush with a margin of 120,000 votes.  Kerry conceded the next morning and Bush was re-elected as President.         
In a rare occurrence, it was found afterwards that Kerry hadn't spent all of the money in his war chest, having over $10 million that could have gone to last minute advertising.  The Democratic party was upset and Kerry never did explain why he allowed this to occur.
Due to the high voter turnout and lack of a strong third party candidate, George Bush's tally of over 62 million votes was the most in United States History and surpassed his winning total in 2000 by over 11 million votes.  John Kerry's 59 million was the second highest for a Presidential candidate, and, of course, the highest for a losing candidate. The relative closeness of the victory was due in part to lopsided Democrat victories in New York and California; ignoring these states, Bush beat Kerry by 5 1/2 percentage points in the remaining 48 states.
After the election, there were a number of allegations of voter fraud and irregularities by those who couldn't face that their candidate lost,[1][2][3][4] and some Democratic poll workers were convicted of misconduct and failure to perform official duties in a vote rigging scheme to bypass a recount of Presidential election ballots.,[5][6] but in the end it meant little to the overall scheme of how the election went.
Adding to a disappointing presidential election for the Democratic party, one of Minnesota's electoral college members inexplicably cast his vote for John Edwards instead of Kerry. New York also made a mistake and gave their electoral votes to ""John L. Kerry"" instead of John F. Kerry.  The state electors gave a corrected set of results to the Senate.

The 1993 World Trade Center bombing was an attack on the World Trade Center which killed 6 and injured 1,042.

Background
The WTC became a symbol of American capitalism and economic dominance, and therefore a vulnerable target for Islamic terrorists.  In 1993, Islamic terrorists detonated a massive truck bomb in an underground parking lot with the goal of knocking the towers over and killing its capacity of 25,000 workers.  This attempt failed, killing only a few, but caused smoke and evacuation of the building.

1st Amendment,https://www.conservapedia.com/1st_Amendment,"The First Amendment to the United States Constitution is an amendment to the United States Constitution, a part of the Bill of Rights, which is generally taken as a limitation on the power of the federal government.  The Amendment protects five specific freedoms:

freedom of religion
free speech
freedom of the press
freedom of assembly
Right to petition
The amendment states:



 “

 Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.

 ”


The protection for free speech was largely motivated to safeguard the preaching of the Bible.  Several passages in the Bible, both Old Testament and New Testament, support a right of free speech, including Numbers 11:26-30 (Moses allowed free speech by declaring, ""If only all the people of the LORD were prophets!"");[1] Mark 9:38-41 (admonition by Jesus not to stop strangers who cast out evil in his name).

Background
A group of colonial leaders known as the Anti-Federalists expressed concern that the Constitution contained no guarantee of individual liberties, and they pressed for the document to be amended.  Their insistence led to the creation of the Bill of Rights by James Madison in 1791.[2]
Madison was the principal author of the Bill of Rights, including the First Amendment.[3][4]

Conservative Interpretation


 “

 To those who cite the First Amendment as reason for excluding God from more and more of our institutions and everyday life, may I just say: The First Amendment of the Constitution was not written to protect the people of this country from religious values; it was written to protect religious values from government tyranny. --- Ronald Reagan

 ”


Liberals often focus on the ""Establishment Clause"", arguing that because the federal government cannot endorse or establish a religion, the state must remain neutral, or even hostile towards religion. This position is not supported by the original intent and application of the Constitution. Michael Farris argues that the Establishment Clause should not apply to the states because it is a jurisdictional limit on federal power, rather than a protection of rights incorporated by either the Due Process Clause or Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  
However, liberals often overlook the clause explicitly allowing for the free exercise of religion, also known as the Free Exercise Clause.  Conservatives argue that this clause can be interpreted to allow much more leeway to the majority of religious Americans than liberals currently allow, and that it provides legislators with great flexibility in supporting the ends of Christian faith, as long as all other religious denominations are equally supported.  The fact that Congress may pass no law establishing or respecting a particular Christian denomination provides the federal government with the freedom to support a variety of Christian ventures, notably the faith-based initiatives enacted under President Bush.
The extent of First Amendment protections of freedom of speech have been a topic of controversy even within the conservative movement. While all conservatives agree that the First Amendment grants absolute protection to ideas, including so-called hate speech, many argue that it does not protect certain ""expressive conduct"" like flag-burning and violent video games, a position opposed by former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who believes that while flag-burning is reprehensible, the First Amendment does not contain an exception allowing for the government to forbid it. [5] [6]

Liberal Violations
American liberals have attempted to use the so-called Fairness Doctrine and political correctness in order to silence conservative viewpoints. These ideologically-motivated attempts to limit free speech are in direct violation of the First Amendment, specifically, and, by extension, the entire U.S. Constitution.
Many liberals also believe in ""hate speech"" laws, which allow the government to silence ""offensive"" views, including criticism of the homosexual agenda, ""racist"" speech (often defined broadly to include opposition to mass immigration) and ""Islamophobia.""

 Jews at the Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement
The Yom Kippur War was fought between Israel, Egypt, and Syria.  The war commenced on October 6, 1973 when Egyptian mechanized divisions crossed the Suez Canal by using a series of pressurized water cannons to demolish sand walls on the opposite side of the canal, and then crossing on pontoon bridges.  This was concurrent to a Syrian advance into the Golan Heights.  The date was chosen because Yom Kippur is the holiest and most solemn day in Judaism, and many Israeli army were stood down during that time.  The delay in mobilization, and the lack of a preemptive strike against Egyptian and Syrian forces allowed the initial success of these advances.  However, the lack of commercial traffic (due to the solemnness of Yom Kippur) allowed Israeli forces to mobilize more quickly than usual.
At first, the Israeli counterattack was focussed primarily against the forces in the Golan Heights as these were much closer to Israel proper, whereas the Egyptian forces in the Sinai peninsula were not as immediate a threat.  Initial counterattacks against both armies were ineffective because the Israelis were hugely outnumbered in armor, although the Egyptians and Syrians were fielding obsolete Russian tanks as opposed to the more modern European and American tanks fielded by Israel.  To counter this advantage, the Arab armies armed their soldiers with Russian anti-tank weapons.  Additionally, both armies used fixed SAM emplacements, and avoided leaving the coverage of this air umbrella, thus blunting the offensive power of the Israeli air force.
Facing defeat, the Israelis implored the United States for military aid, as the Europeans refused to assist under threat of an Arab oil embargo.  The United States airlifted a large number of tanks and aircraft into Israel, thus replacing Israeli losses.  Because of the influx of materiel, the Israelis were able to commit their forces to a renewed offensive posture, overwhelming the older Egyptian and Syrian divisions.
Because the Israelis through the majority of their reserves into the Golan Heights theater, they were able to push back the Syrian advance, and counterattack into Syria, though this counterattack was ultimately turned back by a combined Syrian, Jordanian, and Iraqi force.  In the Sinai, after several attacks and counterattacks, both sides went into a defensive stance to hold the ground that they had.  On October 14, the Egyptian forces decided to attack first, but made a tactical blunder in attacking the Israelis head on and outside of their SAM umbrella.  The Egyptian tanks were decimated by the superior Israeli armor and air power.  The following day, the Israelis counterattacked across the Suez canal.
By October 23, the Israeli army, though pushed back from the outskirts of Damascus, still had captured additional territory near the Golan Heights, and was close to encircling the Egyptian army in the Sinai peninsula.  The United Nations chose this time to impose a cease fire which went into effect at sundown on the 23rd.  However, overnight the Israeli army continued its attack in Egyptian territory in order to complete the encirclement of the Egyptians.  In a conference with Golda Meir that evening, Henry Kissinger asked ""how can anyone ever know where a line is or was in the desert?""  Their army now encircled, the Egyptians had no choice but to accept the cease fire in exchange for the creation of UN checkpoints to allow non-military supplies to reach their army, and the exchange of prisoners of war.  Although the cease fire did not bind the Syrians, they decided not to further counterattack the Israeli army, though their combined force of Syrian, Iraqi, and Jordanian troops had the Israelis in a state of retreat.
Ultimately, the cease fire led to an armistice, and the Camp David accords wherein Egypt agreed to a lasting peace in exchange for the return of the Sinai peninsula, which the Egyptians had lost during the Six Day War, and the recovery of which had been the primary goal of the Yom Kippur War.  However, the airlifting of supplies by the United States to the Israelis directly precipitated the 1973 OPEC oil embargo.

Democratic National Convention
Summary
The 2008 Democratic National Convention was held in Denver, Colorado, from August 25 to August 27 at Pepsi Center. There, Senator Obama and his running mate were selected to be the party nominee's. Barack Obama will accepted the party's nomination in front of a crowd of more than 75,000 in a free, open event held at INVESCO Field at Mile High, in a platform resemblant to a Greek temple. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is the Permanent Chair of the Convention.
The convention had a rocky start as friction between supporters of Obama and the Clintons was not resolved.  Instead of Obama getting a bump in the polls, his support actually declined.  The Democrats also seemed to be at odds on finding a unifying strategy for how hard to attack John McCain and how to present it.  As Democratic pundit James Carville said in an interview on CNN, ""If this party has a message, it's done a <heck> of a job hiding it tonight, I promise you that.""[1]
A bleak convention was turned around by the Clintons. Infighting between Obama and Hillary continued through the day of her speech, but a comprise was reached, and, beyond expectations, she gave a rousing speech for Obama - possibly as an angry response to McCain's latest ad that showed her 'supporting' him. Bill Clinton the next night also praised Obama, something that he failed to effectively do in 2000 for Al Gore when he centered on his accomplishments and gave little more than lip service to Gore with statements amounting to 'and Al Gore was there too'. The convention, possibly remembering that, gave him the topic he was to speak on instead of choosing his own. Clinton was angered, but it worked. He came through. By the time Obama spoke on the last night, the theme that was missing at first was clear, and Obama mixed a message of attacking McCain with the need for change and even outlining some expensive programs that would appeal to the target populace who has been lukewarm to him. From a political point of view, the convention did what it was supposed to.

Scandal
Denver officials had constructed a secret jail to house those that would misbehave in the Mile High City when the Democrats attend their convention. The makeshift holding center, dubbed ""Gitmo on the Platte"" by activists, contained barbed wire fencing and signs warning of stun gun use. The Steele Street warehouse was designed to process 60 arrestees per hour.[2]
Ingrid Mattson, president of the Islamic Society of North America, spoke at a prayer service at the convention. Hidden from the public because nobody debated it at the time, the group has ties to funding Hamas terrorists and the facts were well known July 2008. Mattson's group says it does not condone terrorism.  The Holy Land Foundation and five of its former leaders were convicted of funneling millions of dollars to Hamas for which the ISNA funded and supported.[3]
Cnet reported that in the week of the convention, an unusual phenomenon occurred on Craigslist's Denver Web site. Ads soliciting casual sex spiked 80% that week, as tens of thousands of people had arrived for the Democratic convention. Those convention days showed the week-over-week jump in sex ads. Monday increased 77 percent over the average of earlier in the month; Tuesday increased 69 percent; Wednesday's increase was 74 percent. The online solicitations featured such lurid titles as ""Does the DNC make you hot?"" and content far worse than that.[4] No analogous phenomenon was reported during the Republican convention.

Protest

American Right to Life Action, an anti-abortion group, claims to have displayed the largest ever protest sign in history, 530 feet tall and 666 feet wide. The sign says ""Destroys uNborn Children"" [sic], with the words appearing one atop each other to also form the acronym ""DNC."" [5] According to a release from the group, ""thousands of DNC delegates and journalists can look out their hotel windows to the west to see the sign."" ""The tiniest boys and girls should be loved and protected, but as nominating Barack Obama emphasizes, the DNC even supports killing kids in the womb old enough to know their mother's voice, sleep and dream, suck their thumbs, and play with their toes."" The Guinness Book of World Records assigned American Right To Life an official world record attempt number: 228132.

Republican National Convention
Summary
The 2008 Republican National Convention was held in Saint Paul, Minnesota from September 1 (Labor Day) until September 4. The presumptive nominee was Senator McCain. The location has political significance in that Minnesota will likely be a close state during the general election, as will it's neighboring states Wisconsin and Iowa.
The convention schedule had to be altered due to the upcoming landfall of Hurricane Gustav. The first day almost entirely focused on raising money for Hurricane relief.  This led to a shortened three day convention instead of four and there was some shuffling of who was speaking on which day to accommodate the suddenly shortened time span.  In a surprise, George W. Bush was only delivered an eight minute speech by satellite.  In another surprise Sarah Palin's speech was watched by as many people as saw Obama give his acceptance speech on the closing night of the Democratic convention, as over 40 million people tuned in.[6]  She was considered the highlight of the convention, even surpassing John McCain's speech the next day, and was noted for doing an exceptional job.  Recognizing the strong asset that they have in her, the Republicans made reference to her many times on the last day of the convention.  McCain, not known for being comfortable reading prepared speeches in a convention hall, delivered a solid speech.  While Obama continued to enjoy a lead in the polls, it changed quickly thereafter to a slight McCain-Palin edge.  The Republican convention more than canceled out a very powerful Democratic convention.

Convention Schedule
Note:  Due to the hurricane and the effort to use their public forum to raise funds for it, the first night of the Republican convention was not shown.  Adjustments were made throughout to accommodate that loss.

Differences between 2008 and other elections
In 2008, CNN-YouTube held the first debate in which the questions asked of the nominees in each party came primarily from YouTube viewer submitted videos. The debates received high ratings, however, CNN was criticized for not picking questions that were 'tough' or pertinent enough. One such example was during the Democratic Debate, when CNN chose to ask a question from a snow man, talking about global warming. During the Republican debate, some claimed that many of the questions were from Democratic supporters just meant to embarrass the Republican candidates. For example, a question over whether or not homosexuals should serve in the U.S. military was asked by retired general and gay activist Keith Kerr, an adviser to Hillary Clinton's campaign. 
The internet has also played a major role in the election, with then-Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul and Democratic candidate Barack Obama being very active on the internet.

Young voters
In 2004, 64% of voters aged 18–29 were registered to vote.  This year 75% of voters in that age group are registered.  This demographic usually favors Democrats.

Fewer Uncommitted
Fewer people were undecided this election than in most previous elections.  As of the beginning of October, 2008 approximately 6-8% of poll respondents were undecided, an amount that continued to decline as the election drew closer.

Election Day
The turnout was about normal, except for higher than usual rates among blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and voters under 30—all Obama groups.  The turnout of evangelicals and whites was similar to 2004. There have been allegations of Democrats driving voters around to different voting stations, and as these are Obama groups, this would strengthen the voter turnout of this demographic.

McCain vs. Obama
McCain had the early edge, wrapping up the Republican nomination before Obama was known to be the choice of the Democrats, but this was one of the few advantages he has had.  Both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama raised far more money than McCain, and the Democratic primary saw a surge of new voters coming out leading to a large increase in the rolls of Democrats.  From the historical position of a generally equal number of Republicans and Democrats, the numbers have now tilted 41% Democrat to only 32% Republican.  From the time that Obama was declared the nominee, opinion polling showed him with a modest advantage over McCain in terms of who the voters would choose to be their next President.
Obama's strategy was to tie McCain to George Bush, a very unpopular President, even though McCain was not a part of the Bush administration and often clashed with Bush during his time as senator.  McCain, for his part, had to walk a fine line with accepting praise from the President to woo conservatives, while at the same time keeping enough distance so as to not alienate moderates.  When possible, McCain went after Obama's lack of foreign policy experience.
The trends heavily favored the Democrats, especially after their major gains in 2006.  Overall, Democrat candidates have a +10% advantage over Republicans in a 'generic' election - the current unpopular President is a Republican, and the economy is treading water.  Also, based on statistical percentages of articles on each candidate, Obama was being focused on by the press far more than McCain.  When McCain chastised Obama for his lack of foreign policy experience and that he hadn't been to Iraq or Afghanistan in years, Obama's campaign set up for him to take a trip to both countries.  While this is expected in politics, the decision of every major network to send a team of reporters to follow him was unprecedented.  Obama spoke to 200,000 people in Berlin in a highly covered speech.  McCain spoke to 50,000 in Buffalo shortly thereafter and barely got a whisper.  Obama's numbers started to rise, but a good deal of the populace was noticing the disparity as 48% of those polled felt the press was trying to help Obama win.
Obama seemed pleased to coast on his advantages, but McCain realized he needed to shake things up.  He scored by pushing offshore drilling for oil during a time when oil prices were climbing almost daily.  Obama rejected the idea, but the poll numbers started to show a greater percentage of Americans warming to the concept[2] and McCain's numbers started to improve.  Obama announced he would accept some measure of offshore drilling, and McCain's momentum was halted and his gains retreated by a couple of points.  McCain started an ad campaign that acknowledged Obama's celebrity status, but asking what it meant.  A few days later at the start of August he called out Obama for 'playing the race card' when Obama made a reference to McCain and Bush trying to scare people because he (Obama) doesn't look like other Presidents on dollar bills.  The Democrats fired back, but quickly let the issue drop when poll numbers showed that most voters did consider Obama's statement to be racist.[3]  The bounce for Obama after the Berlin speech shrank back to pre-trip levels.  While Obama continued to enjoy a slight lead in the polls, McCain continued to keep the race close without either candidate breaking away. 
In mid-August, both candidates came together at the invitation of Pastor Rick Warren where each was asked a series of the same questions dealing both with political and personal views.  While not a debate, it was the first televised forum where both candidates had a chance to express themselves and their positions.  Obama hoped to appeal to Christian conservatives by expressing a religious side while McCain hoped to solidify the conservative base by sharing his own conservative and religious credentials.  The difference in style between the two was evident as Obama spent more time explaining and expounding on his positions while McCain was more straightforward and received more laughs with his candid speaking style.  The polling numbers continued as they had been.
There was a bounce at the start of the Democratic convention, but not what was expected as McCain suddenly drew even in the race.  The friction between Hillary Clinton and Obama as well as the perceived slight of Hillary when Biden was chosen as the Vice Presidential candidate hurt Obama at a time when his approval was expected to climb.  McCain then made a mistake by airing an ad of Hillary Clinton that 'supported' him.  Clinton was set to speak at the convention and it was no secret that there was bad blood between her and Obama and it was widely believed that her support for Obama would be lukewarm at best.  Instead, apparently galvanized by McCain's hubris before her speech, she came out strongly for Obama and rallied those who supported her.  Obama's pre-convention edge returned.  Obama followed it up with a very strong speech the next day in a huge stadium with fireworks and a Greek temple.  Dick Morris, a former Bill Clinton political strategist who gave advice to the Republicans in 2008, felt that Obama had done such a good job reaching out to the groups that he needed that he would pull ahead by double-digits.  In order to suppress the bounce from the convention, McCain announced his Vice Presidential candidate the next day, a woman, Alaskan governor Sarah Palin.  The bounce for Obama was muted at first, but increased in the following days to surpass pre-convention levels, especially as Sarah Palin came under heavy attack in the media.
The edge continued as the Republican convention began.  Losing a day to the hurricane, their shortened convention came out strong as well, emphasizing John McCain as a patriot and a maverick for change who is tested and will do what is right for the country regardless of political affiliation.  It was notable for the secondary role that the sitting President played, talking only briefly and barely being mentioned after that.  The convention tied McCain to Ronald Reagan, a popular Republican President who was able to gain the support of a good number of conservative Democrats, an ability that McCain would badly need to emulate.  While the convention had very high ratings starting with Palin's well received speech, it was unclear what the impact would be in the polls.  Indeed, Obama continued to lead directly afterward, but that soon changed with a turn of about 8 points and a slim lead for McCain.  The Republican convention had actually more than balanced out the powerful Democratic convention.
While Obama had stated that his campaign would avoid negative advertising, as it became clear that the bounce from the convention was continuing to last and he might lose the election, his campaign turned more forcefully to negative advertising.  In ads aired since the Republican convention through mid September, McCain's ads were about Obama 56% of the time, but Obama's ads were about his opponents 77% of the time.[4]  Obama also received a large boost from the press which vigorously attacked McCain, but even more so Palin.  Obama appeared on The O'Reilly Factor and was treated with civility and respect, even if not with agreement.  McCain and his wife appeared on The View and were treated to openly antagonistic attacks.  The constant negative barrage and reporting slowly moved the numbers back to even.
As the negative articles on Palin continued to intensify, some of which just quoted celebrities who had never met her calling her ""whacko"" or a ""hater of women"", her first major interview with Gibson was a turning point.  Gibson asked Palin about the Bush Doctrine, but wouldn't define it for her even as she asked questions for clarifications.  When she then answered with her understanding, Gibson rebuked her by implying that she misunderstood the doctrine.  In truth, since the term is only a press invention, it has taken on different meanings at different times and the definition that Palin gave matched one that Gibson himself had used years earlier.  Nevertheless, it was a moment and was jumped on by the press.  Those who saw the interview voted heavily that they were now less likely to vote for Palin.  The attack on her had muted her effectiveness, even if it was unjustified.
Stemming the tide of the McCain campaign's lead became a strong swing for Obama with a series of events that went to the Democratic nominee's favor.  The polls began to tack to Obama's favor with the collapse of Lehman Brothers and a subsequent 500-point drop in the Dow Jones Index.  Then, President Bush sounded a major alarm on the economy and proposed a huge 700 billion dollar rescue plan for the mortgage industry, which sent shock waves through the American populace and swept them with even more fear on the economic picture.  Bush called both Presidential nominees to meet with him and Congress.  It gave Obama a boost in legitimacy, his previous Achilles' heel.  While he had a weak record in accomplishments and showing leadership, the chance to be propelled to a position of prominence handed it to him on a silver platter.  Moreover, the plan was more problematic among Republicans than it was among Democrats, giving Obama another boost merely by supporting it while putting McCain on more shaky ground.  Both candidates supported it once again blurring McCain's advantage in experience if both men were seen as interchangeable in their reaction.
McCain chose to suspend his campaign until a deal on the rescue package was reached, a mistake.  The Democrats could add pork to the plan and make it even more unpalatable to the Republicans, and they did.  As the first debate loomed and no deal had been reached, McCain was in a quandary.  He chose to attend the debate under the view that the plan was well under way to being passed.  After the debate the plan was actually defeated and wouldn't be adopted, with more changes, until the following week.
McCain's debate with Obama went well and he was viewed as having done better than expected.  Unfortunately for him, Obama was also viewed as doing better than expected and was seen as looking Presidential, further cementing his standing and locking in a lead in the polls that had become rather substantial.  The Vice Presidential debate was the most watched in history and Palin was given high marks for her performance, but unfortunately for the Republican ticket, Biden was also on his game that night and also came across well.  There were no changes in the polling numbers and the number of undecided voters began to quickly dwindle.  The second and third debates caused little change as well.
With Obama spending 110 million dollars on TV advertising in October alone, including 30 minute specials on each of the major networks, McCain was hard pressed to make up the necessary ground to win the election after being outspent by 3 to 1 for TV adds over that time period.  He couldn't count on regular TV to help put in a good word for him either, as late night political jokes are running at a pace of 7 jokes against McCain/Palin for every 1 joke against Obama/Biden and a study of news stories on McCain and Obama since the end of the conventions found that 57% of news stories about McCain were negative while only 29% were for Obama.[5]  A later study by the independent Pew Research Center found that the discrepancy had grown even worse.  McCain had 57% of the articles about him negative while only 14% were positive, while Obama had more positive articles than negative.  The only network to achieve a balance, 40% negative for both, was Fox News.[6]

General Strategy
McCain's team emphasized to convince the electorate of the long-term leadership and experience that John McCain has shown in two decades of government service while emphasizing the relative untested nature of Barack Obama.
Obama's team stressed that Obama is the candidate of fresh ideas while downplaying his relative inexperience compared to the more seasoned McCain.  When possible, McCain is lumped together with George Bush, an unpopular President.

Republican Strategy
With more limited funding than his Democratic rival, McCain had favored open town hall meetings to attract the greatest number of people.  He is focusing his advertising on swing states.  He also asked for open debates with Obama of the Lincoln-Douglas variety where candidates can talk directly to each other, but this was not accepted by the Democratic camp which prefers the current structured format.
McCain will highlight his record of leadership, his service to his country and stress that as President he can be counted on to keep America safe from outside threats.  McCain's strongest supporters are the elderly - the group that most wants stability.
McCain's choice of Sarah Palin as his Vice Presidential nominee was a departure from what was expected and helped to show that he would go down paths that the Republican party had not done in the past.  McCain has touted Palin's record of standing up to the Alaska Republican party when she resigned from an Ethics Commission in protest over a lack of ethics of fellow commissioners, as well as when she ran against, and beat, then-incumbent Governor Frank Murkowski in the Republican primary in 2006.  McCain will continue to tout her as a ""maverick"" to complement his own maverick image that he is trying to emphasize. Last, by choosing a female running mate, McCain hoped to pick up the votes of female voters disaffected with the perceived slight of Hillary Clinton by Obama.  Prior to the start of the Democratic convention, 30% of Hillary's supporters had still not backed Obama and there was a good deal of bad blood between the two.
With the unfolding of the campaign season and watching the Democratic strategy and how it was playing out in the press and polls, the McCain campaign decided not to cede the moniker of change to Obama, but rather to take it upon themselves by emphasizing that McCain has a track record of change - while Obama does not.  The McCain campaign feels it needs to have the voters ask who can be trusted more to get the job done, and if that occurs, then they have the advantage.
With the selection of Palin, and the energy it has brought to the conservative base, McCain has taken to larger rallies, as opposed to town hall meetings and press conferences.  By mid-September, he had gone four weeks without a town hall, and three weeks without a press conference, instead sticking to larger engagements, appearing alongside his vice presidential nominee, with larger crowds than he had experienced earlier in his campaign.

Democratic Strategy
Democrats are confident that the low popularity of President Bush and particularly Operation Iraqi Freedom, which John McCain supports, puts them in a highly favorable position for 2008.  They have been cautious in the Iraq arena realizing that 'The Surge' worked and they were on the wrong end of that issue.  Focus is being put on a timeline for troops coming home, a position that most of the American population favors.
Democrats believe it is their race to lose, but also realize they had a good chance to win the last two Presidential elections and came up short each time.  General wisdom also states that a poor economy favors Obama, so they will emphasize the dire times in this area.  As in past elections, differences between those who have obtained a high income level and those who have not will be emphasized. In fact, the Democratic strategy in many ways mirrors that of their strategy in 1992 when the Democrat-controlled Congress deliberately caused economic disruption, knowing full well that the public would blame sitting president George H.W. Bush, and thereby allowing Bill Clinton to win that year's presidential race.
Favored by the young, Democrats will try hard to encourage and get out the young vote, a task that has proven more difficult than expected in the last two election cycles.  To their advantage, Obama made his vice presidential pick via text message to cell phone numbers registered on the site.  The announcement went to 3 million cell phones, a useful database for ""Get Out The Vote"" (GOTV) efforts, when voters may not be home or reachable on their landline.
As an extension of the DNC's strategy in the 2006 elections, led by Howard Dean, Barack Obama has been working towards a ""50-state strategy.""  The campaign is working to place campaign offices throughout the country with a focus on voter registration.  The increase in the rolls of Democratic voters from the primary battle between Hillary Clinton and Obama played out well for the Democrats and puts pressure on Senator McCain even in typically red states, and more specifically, ""Lean Republican"" states, to use the Cook Political Report's term.  In addition, with a fundraising advantage, Obama is airing ads in those tight states forcing McCain to make decisions about whether to use funds to match ads and campaign efforts in those states or rely on historical results that those states will support him and focus funds in traditional toss-up states instead.

Fundraising
Barack Obama had a significant edge over Hillary Clinton in the fundraising department during their contest for the Democratic nomination, but both actually set records for raising money and both raised far more money than John McCain.  McCain didn't have to spend as much since he locked up the Republican nomination much earlier than Obama locked up the Democratic.  Both Obama and McCain said they would accept government funds—which would also cap how much the candidates could raise on their own—but Obama, who could presumably raise more through his own sources, changed his mind and later declined.  Much of McCain's war chest will come from the Republican Party in general, which has more money to spend than their Democratic counterparts.  McCain's campaign raised $47 million in August, a very sizable figure for him so far and a personal record, but not as strong as Obama's best months. In the same time period, Obama set a record with $66 million. Obama, still having an edge in fundraising that has continued throughout his run for the Presidency, saw $10 million collected the day after Sarah Palin's strongly received convention speech, a new one day record.[7]  The Palin announcement has been good for John McCain's fundraising as well.
Obama set a new record of $150 million raised in September and over $600 million overall.[8]  Obama's camp does not release information on who contributes to the campaign.


Conventions
Democratic National Convention
For a more detailed treatment, see 2008 Democratic National Convention.
The 2008 Democratic National Convention was held in Denver, Colorado, from August 25 to August 27 at Pepsi Center. There, Senator Obama and his running mate were selected to be the party nominee's. Barack Obama will accepted the party's nomination in front of a crowd of more than 75,000 in a free, open event held at INVESCO Field at Mile High, in a platform resemblant to a Greek temple. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is the Permanent Chair of the Convention.
The convention had a rocky start as friction between supporters of Obama and the Clintons was not resolved.  Instead of Obama getting a bump in the polls, his support actually declined.  The Democrats also seemed to be at odds on finding a unifying strategy for how hard to attack John McCain and how to present it.  As Democratic pundit James Carville said in an interview on CNN, ""If this party has a message, it's done a <heck> of a job hiding it tonight, I promise you that.""[9]
A bleak convention was turned around by the Clintons. Infighting between Obama and Hillary continued through the day of her speech, but a comprise was reached, and, beyond expectations, she gave a rousing speech for Obama - possibly as an angry response to McCain's latest ad that showed her 'supporting' him. Bill Clinton the next night also praised Obama, something that he failed to effectively do in 2000 for Al Gore when he centered on his accomplishments and gave little more than lip service to Gore with statements amounting to 'and Al Gore was there too'. The convention, possibly remembering that, gave him the topic he was to speak on instead of choosing his own. Clinton was angered, but it worked. He came through. By the time Obama spoke on the last night, the theme that was missing at first was clear, and Obama mixed a message of attacking McCain with the need for change and even outlining some expensive programs that would appeal to the target populace who has been lukewarm to him. From a political point of view, the convention did what it was supposed to.


Republican National Convention
For a more detailed treatment, see 2008 Republican National Convention.
The 2008 Republican National Convention was held in Saint Paul, Minnesota from September 1 (Labor Day) until September 4. The presumptive nominee was Senator McCain. The location has political significance in that Minnesota will likely be a close state during the general election, as will its neighboring states Wisconsin and Iowa.
The convention schedule had to be altered due to the upcoming landfall of Hurricane Gustav. The first day almost entirely focused on raising money for Hurricane relief.  This led to a shortened three day convention instead of four and there was some shuffling of who was speaking on which day to accommodate the suddenly shortened time span.  In a surprise, George W. Bush was only delivered an eight-minute speech by satellite.  In another surprise Sarah Palin's speech was watched by as many people as saw Obama give his acceptance speech on the closing night of the Democratic convention, as over 40 million people tuned in.[10]  She was considered the highlight of the convention, even surpassing John McCain's speech the next day, and was noted for doing an exceptional job.  Recognizing the strong asset that they have in her, the Republicans made reference to her many times on the last day of the convention.  McCain, not known for being comfortable reading prepared speeches in a convention hall, delivered a solid speech.  While Obama continued to enjoy a lead in the polls, it changed quickly thereafter to a slight McCain-Palin edge.  The Republican convention more than canceled out a very powerful Democratic convention.

Leftist violence
 Poster circulated by community organizers. Other posters depicted rock throwers with the caption, ""Shut Down the RNC!,"" dead elephants, and derogatory and demeaning comments about gay Republicans. [2]
Progressives for Obama shares a huge membership overlap with the Movement for a Democratic Society (MDS), a group of former Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) members and sympathisers. MDS re-founded SDS in 2006 for a new generation of college students and functions as a support group for SDS's 130 college chapters. Independent researcher Trevor Louden refers to MDS as ""the brains behind the SDS brawn.""  The reconstituted SDS was very prominent in the violence at the Republican National Convention at St Paul.[11] The founder of ACORN, Wade Rathke, denouncd[12] an FBI informer who foiled a terrorist plot to kill delegates at the Republican Convention.[13]

Vice Presidential Candidates
Democratic Vice-Presidential Candidate
On August 23, Senator Barack Obama announced, via text message to 3 million cell phone numbers of his supporters, his nomination of Joseph Biden to Vice President.  Biden's selection was considered to be a prudent move by Obama, filling a hole in his own foreign policy experience that McCain could exploit.  With the implosion of John Edwards, Biden was widely expected to be the choice.  In order to help build up suspense, Biden said he was not chosen when he spoke to the press the day before, only to be shown as the Vice Presidential candidate the next day.  A long-term senator and Washington insider with over two decades of service in the Senate, his earlier 1988 plagiarism scandal and frequent gaffes (including one in which he insulted Obama in a racist manner during the 2008 election) were deemed to be less negative than the positive that his strong experience credentials could bring to the race.  

 Joseph Biden




Republican Vice-Presidential Candidate
 thumb
Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska was announced as John McCain's choice early on Friday, August 29, the day after the Democratic convention ended.  A surprise choice not even considered by the press to be on McCain's short list, her selection caught the political world off guard.  It had been expected that Mitt Romney would earn the honor, but McCain had other ideas.  At first denigrated by the people in the Obama campaign, Obama's own statement was one of cautious neutrality to feel out what impact her selection would have on the race.


In an interesting twist, the selection of the Vice Presidential candidates changed the dynamics of the race.  By Obama picking Biden, he helped to fill the hole that McCain had been attacking dealing with a lack of foreign policy experience.  McCain's strongest point, experience, would lose some of its luster.  But the selection of Biden, and the passing over of Hillary Clinton, left another opening.  By aligning himself with someone who has been a Democratic stalwart, Obama's claim to change became less pronounced.  McCain seized upon that to select a Vice President that no one expected, and a woman, and steal some of the Democratic thunder.  Her lack of foreign policy experience would cut into the experience angle that had been in play earlier, but her own maverick streak in becoming governor by ousting another Republican, combined with John McCain's maverick choice in selecting her led to a new emphasis on McCain's own maverick past. Palin arguably had more ""executive"" / managerial experience than either McCain, Biden or, notably, Obama.  Suddenly he saw an opportunity to steal the moniker of change that Obama had been wearing, and he went for it.  Such a change in position occurring from the Vice Presidential selection is rare in Presidential politics.

Debates
Presidential Debates
For a more detailed treatment, see 2008 Presidential Debates.
There have been three presidential debates for the 2008 election season.  The first debate on September 26 discussed ""Foreign Policy & National Security"" and also dealt at length with the economic crisis. The result was a statistical draw where both candidates did better than expected in the eyes of the public.  The longer term impact worked out well for Obama who already had a lead going in, and benefited from solidifying that position.
The second debate on October 7, followed a town hall-style.  The questions came from audience members and the Internet, as chosen by the moderator.  Again the result was a statistical draw as far as who was considered to be the winner.  But with time running out for McCain, he needed something to make the people move his way, and that required a clear breakthrough that never happened
The final debate was held on October 15 concerned ""Domestic and Economic Policy."" Both candidates were again viewed as having done well, which was a tactical defeat for McCain as the poll numbers showed only small changes.

Vice Presidential Debate
There was one vice presidential debate held on October 2.  Palin did much better than expected, but Biden was also in top form.  No clear winner emerged and the poll numbers remained largely unchanged, a strategic win for the Democratic ticket that only had to maintain their lead to win the election.  The number of people who watched the debate was an alltime record for a Vice Presidential debate, and was viewed by more people than any of the three Presidential debates.

Third parties and Independents
As usual there were a number of third party candidates, but none made much of an impact.  Briefly the Libertarian Bob Barr had enough strength to become a spoiler for McCain.  He faded quickly. See United States Presidential Election, 2008 -- Third Party Candidates.

Primaries
For expanded primary information, see United States Presidential Election, 2008 - Primaries
The primary season for both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party officially began on January 3, 2008 with the Iowa Caucuses and ended on June 3, 2008.[14]  The 2008 election cycle saw a major shift in the primary election calendar, frontloading many primaries into early February.[15]
John McCain had to get his footing at first, but was pretty much assured the Republican nomination after Super Tuesday.  Barack Obama had a much tougher road, but rode out a string of victories in February to eventually outlast Clinton and take the nomination.  During that time he had raised more money than any other candidate in history giving him a huge boost, a trend that would continue into the general election.

104th Congress,https://www.conservapedia.com/104th_Congress,"The 104th United States Congress was the sessions of Congress that occurred from January 3, 1995 to January 3, 1997. Due to the Contract with America and dissatisfaction with Democratic policies, the elections of 1994 finally saw an increase in the Republican majority of Congress. House speaker Newt Gingrich declared Congress ""under new management"" during this Congress. This Congress was able to pass much excellent conservative pro-American legislation despite liberal and impeached president Bill Clinton being in office. Coincidentally, the ushering in of a Republican dominated Congress exactly coincided with the success of the US economy, a strong economy that lasted until the Democrats surprisingly won power back in 2006. Not surprisingly, the economy then dropped sharply, as did Congressional opinion polls.
The 104th Congress was the most productive in nearly 50 years.  President Bill Clinton, fearing defeat in 1996, signed many good bills into law.  The accomplishments of the 104th Congress included:

DOMA
Welfare reform
Prisoner litigation reform
the Solomon Amendment

1 Maccabees,https://www.conservapedia.com/1_Maccabees,"The First Book of Maccabees is found in the books of the Septuagint, the Old Testament accepted as inspired and canonical by the Orthodox Church in the Greek Orthodox Bible, and found in the books of the Old Testament of the Vulgate and included in the canon of inspired scripture by the Third Council of Carthage (397). It is included in the canon of the Ethiopian Orthodox Bible. Since the Council of Trent it is dogmatically accepted as inspired and canonical by the Catholic Church in the Catholic Bible—books of the Bible accepted as divinely inspired by the majority of Christian believers in the United States and throughout the world.[1][2]
1 Maccabees was first removed from the Old Testament and placed in the Apocrypha by Martin Luther in the 16th century. The First Book of Maccabees is regarded as an apocryphal book of the Old Testament by less than one-third of Christian believers.[2]

Canonical status
The First and Second Books of Maccabees are regarded by Jews and Protestants as apocryphal, that is, not inspired Scripture, because they were not contained in the Jewish list of books drawn up at the end of A.D. the first century. They have always been accepted as an integral part of the traditional Septuagint since the beginning of the 1st century, used as scripture accepted by Greek-speaking Jews before the birth of Christ, and during his ministry and after his ascension, and accepted as inspired books of the Old Testament since the middle of the 1st century by the ancient church of the apostles and the Catholic and Orthodox Church in the east and west. They are called ""deuterocanonical"" to indicate that they are canonical even though they have been disputed by some.[3]
The four books of I, II, III, and IV Maccabees are included in the Biblical canon of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.

Name
The name, Maccabee (Hebrew: מכבי), is probably derived from the Hebrew word makkabah, ""hammer"", and this has become the traditional interpretation of its meaning. It is actually applied in the Books of Maccabees to only one man, Judas Maccabeus (""Mac-cab-be-es"", ""Maccabe-es"") third son of the priest Mattathias and first leader of the revolt, the ""Hammer"" of the resistance, against the Seleucid kings who persecuted the Jews (1 Maccabees 2:4, 66; 2 Maccabees 8:5, 16; 10:1, 16). Traditionally the name, ""the Maccabees"", has come to be extended to the 4 brothers of Judas and his supporters, and even to other Jewish heroes of the period, such as the seven martyred brothers (2 Maccabees chapter 7).
In the Septuagint the title of the book is ΜΑΚΚΑΒΑΙΩΝ Α. In the Vulgate under the heading Machabaeorum the title of the book is Machabaeorum I. In the Douay-Rheims Bible the title of the book is I Machabees.In the Apocrypha the title of the book is I Maccabees. The most common English spelling today is 1 Maccabees, or First Maccabees.
The title is commonly abbreviated in commentaries and footnotes as 1 Macc. or 1 Mc..

Contents
The two Books of the Maccabees contain independent (in part identical) accounts of events that occurred during the attempted suppression of Judaism in Palestine in the second century B.C.. The vigorous reaction to this attempt established for a time the religious and political independence of the Jews, under the priestly dynastic rule of the Hasmoneans, which lasted from 146 B.C. until 63 B.C..
First Maccabees is one of the Historical books of the Bible, similar in tone to the books of Kings and Chronicles and Joshua and Judges. It covers the history of the Jews beginning from the (briefly mentioned) time of the rise of Alexander the Great during the high priesthood of Jaddua about 333 B.C. (Nehemiah 12:10-11, 22), and continues through the details of the persecution of Antiochus IV Epiphanes, and the war of resistance of the Maccabees, to the beginning of the high priesthood of John Hyrcanus I of the Hasmonean Dynasty and the establishment of the independent kingdom of Judea about 124 B.C.. The book is written as a testimony and witness demonstrating to its hearers the miraculous providence of God in preserving the nation in the face of violent religious oppression, and the overcoming of pagan forces seeking the annihilation of the Jews and the systematic destruction of the books (scrolls) of the sacred scriptures containing the written Word of God.
The work was written about 100 B.C., in Hebrew. The original has not come down to us, but instead, we have an early, pre-Christian, Greek translation full of Hebrew idioms. The author himself is unknown. He was probably a Palestinian Jew, familiar with the traditions and sacred books of his people and had access to much reliable information on their recent history (from 175 to 134 B.C.), and he may well have played some part in it as a young man. The writer's purpose is clearly to record the deliverance of Israel that God worked through the family of Mattathias the priest (5:62)—especially through Judas called Maccabeus, Jonathan called Apphus, and Simon called Thassi, three of his five sons (the other two are John surnamed Gaddi and Eleazar called Avaran), and through his grandson, John Hyrcanus son of Simon. The author compares their virtues and their exploits with those of Israel's ancient heroes, Joshua, the Judges, Samuel, and David.
Chapter 4:36-59 relates the triumphant recovery and dedication of the Temple after the defilement of the pagans and those apostate Jews who had gone over to Hellenism. The Feast of the Dedication is mentioned in the Gospel According to John, chapter 10:22-23. Today this celebration is called Ḥanukkah.

Divisions of the book
First Maccabees can be divided as follows:
Crisis and Response (1:1–2:70)
Leadership of Judas Maccabeus (3:1–9:22)
Leadership of Jonathan (9:23–12:53)
Leadership of Simon (13:1–16:17)
Succession of John Hyrcanus (16:18-24)

Chapter summary headings
The chapter summary headings as found in the Douay-Rheims Bible are as follows:
The First Book of the Machabees.

1 The reign of Alexander and his successors: Antiochus rifles and profanes the temple of God: and persecutes unto death all that will not forsake the law of God, and the religion of their fathers.
2 The zeal and success of Mathathias. His exhortation to his sons at his death.
3 Judas Machabeus succeeds his father, and overthrows Apollonius and Seron. A great army is sent against him out of Syria. He prepares his people for battle by fasting and prayer.
4 Judas routs the king's army. Gorgias flies before him. Lysias comes against him with a great army, but is defeated. Judas cleanses the temple, sets up a new altar, and fortifies the sanctuary.
5 Judas and his brethren attack the enemies of their country, and deliver them that were distressed. Josephus and Azarias, attempting contrary to order to fight against their enemies, are defeated.
6 The fruitless repentance and death of Antiochus. His son comes against Judas with a formidable army. He besieges Sion: but at last makes peace with the Jews.
7 Demetrius is made king, and sends Bacchides and Alcimus the priest into Judea, and after them Nicanor, who is slain by Judas with all his army.

Historical-grammatical analysis: Historical setting
The First Book of Maccabees, beginning with the accession of King Antiochus IV to the Seleucid throne in 175 B.C., covers a period of just over forty years in Jewish history. The book is a ""dynastic history"" concentrated on the exploits of one priestly family—the priest Mattathias; his sons Judas Maccabeus, Jonathan, Simon, John, and Eleazar; and Simon's son John Hyrcanus. The sons of Mattathias, known collectively as the Maccabees, rescued the Jerusalem temple from pagan hands and eventually gained political independence for the Jews. They are the founders of the Hasmonean dynasty, which provided political and spiritual leadership for Israel for about a century. The rededication of the Jerusalem Temple described in 4:36–59 (see 2 Maccabees 10:1–8) is the origin of the Jewish feast of Hanukkah.
The book's ending seems to indicate that it was completed sometime after the end of John Hyrcanus's reign in 104 B.C. On the other hand, since it speaks of the Romans in favorable—even idealistic—terms (see I Macc. 8:1-16), it was certainly written before 63 B.C., when a Roman takeover of Jerusalem under Pompey ended Hasmonean rule.
The book is our most important historical source for the period of Jewish history it describes. Josephus considered it to be reliable; he paraphrased 1 Maccabees 1:11-13:42 in books twelve and thirteen of his Antiquities of the Jews. 1 Maccabees, with its extensive use of official documents and precise dates, purports to be an accurate account of the Maccabean revolt, and at the same time, the book has an unmistakable point of view. Written in the style of 1 and 2 Kings (see 1 Maccabees 9:22; 16:23-24), it portrays the Maccabees as God's chosen instruments (5:62) and worthy successors of earlier kings and priests of Israel. The book makes several connections between these earlier heroes and the Maccabees. In them is combined for the first time in Jewish history the offices of high priest and king of the people. Compare Pope.

Historical, religious, cultural background: the Challenge of Hellenism
First Maccabees begins with the rise to power of Alexander the Great. He had conquered the empire of the Medes and Persians (including the land of Israel) and set up his own Graeco-Macedonian empire in its place (1:1-4; see Dan. 8:5-7, 20-21). Just before he died in 323 B.C., he divided his vast territories among four of his ""most honored officers"" (1:6; Daniel 8:8, 22). One of those officers, Ptolemy, controlled Palestine, and he and his successors in Egypt ruled over the Jews until 198 B.C., when Israel came under the authority of the Syrian Seleucids, whose empire was headquartered at Antioch.

The importance of the Greek polis
Although Alexander's rule was short-lived (twelve years, according to I Macc. 1:7), the policies that he set in motion had a profound effect on the world for centuries to come. A pupil of Aristotle and lover of Greek ways, Alexander hoped to use Greek language, learning, and culture to unite the empire. To this end, he founded Greek cities (poleis) throughout his territories. Dr. Oskar Skarsaune (In the Shadow of the Temple, page 31 [4]) gives the following description of a typical polis:

""A polis contained some obligatory institutions: a public town center and marketplace (the square agora); a hall for the city council (the bouleuterion); baths; temples to the Greek (later Roman) gods; a theater; a gymnasium (a combined higher school and sports training ground); preferably a library and a sports stadium; and if a big city, also a hippodrome.""
By means of the poleis, Greek culture was introduced to surrounding areas and mingled with the native cultures of those regions, creating a cultural synthesis called Hellenism. Correspondingly, the spread of Greek language and customs was known as ""Hellenization"" (see 2 Macc. 4:13).
Hellenization
In their interactions with Greek culture, the various native cultures did not enjoy a ""level playing field."" Although the Greeks had some admiration for the more ancient cultures of their empire (In the Shadow of the Temple, pages 29–30 [4]), they were still the ones in charge. Skarsaune comments, ""Greek culture was the culture of the conquerors, the rulers, the armies and the new business elite. Greek was the language of government and administration, business and commerce. And Greek literature was taken as the supreme model for all kinds of literary production. In other words, Greek culture was the culture of the new era, and anyone who would belong to the new elite had to adopt it"" (In the Shadow of the Temple, p. 28 [4]).
Thus the dominant Greek culture created great pressure to Hellenize through its attractions. A number of ancient cultures essentially disappeared from history as a result, swallowed up by Hellenism.
Hellenism offered both opportunities and temptations for the Jews. Ultimately, Jewish thought was greatly enriched by certain Greek concepts. A prime example is the Greek idea that ""the hidden law governing the entire universe is divine reason, logos, and the moral task of humanity is to live a life of conformity to this divine reason, which is the law of ethics as well as the law of nature"" (In the Shadow of the Temple, p. 35 [4]). Beginning with the author of Sirach in the early second century B.C. (c. 150), Jewish thinkers identified the underlying universal law as God's Torah (see especially Sirach 24). Thus, a Hellenistic concept, logos, led to the exaltation of the God of Israel and the promotion of his inspired word, finding its purest expression in the words of the beginning of the Gospel of John:

""In the Beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God"" John 1:1.
However, Hellenism also created temptations for Jews to compromise aspects of the Torah—the Sabbath, circumcision, and dietary laws—which set them apart as a unique and distinct people, as being identifiably those who worship and serve the only real God. Some Jews and Greeks reasoned that, by remaining separate from the Gentiles, the Jewish people and the nation were missing out on the wealth and prestige also afforded by Hellenism.
By the time the greedy and power-hungry Seleucid, Antiochus IV, took over the Seleucid throne in 175 B.C. (1 Maccabees 1:10), there seems to have arisen a considerable controversy in Judea over the issue of Hellenism (1:11-15). One of those who favored Hellenization was Yeshua (called Jason), the brother of Onias (III) the high priest. Jason handsomely bribed the new king in order to seize control of the high priesthood from Onias.

The Second Book of Maccabees tells us that Jason despised the authority of Torah by taking steps to transform Jerusalem into a Greek polis (2 Maccabees 4:9-17). First Maccabees 1:11-15 does not explicitly mention Jason's name, but it is evident that he was chief among the ""renegades"" referred to in those verses. Jason probably rationalized his corrupt actions by claiming that his Hellenization program was in the best interests of the people. Instead, his takeover of the high priesthood set in motion a sequence of events that led to one of the greatest spiritual and cultural crises in the history of Israel.""All the Gentiles accepted the command of the king. Many even from Israel gladly adopted his religion; they sacrificed to idols and profaned the sabbath."" 1 Maccabees 1:43.
The Abomination of Desolation
Ironically, when Jason sent his subordinate Menelaus to Antiochus on official business in 172 B.C., Menelaus double-crossed him in much the same way that Jason had ousted Onias, and managed to grab the high priesthood for himself by outbidding and offering a bribe to the greedy king much richer than Jason's (2 Maccabees 4:23-24).
Menelaus was another Hellenizer, and he seems to have been mainly concerned with staying in office and lining his own pockets. He quietly arranged for Onias to be murdered (Daniel 11:21-22), causing a cry of outrage from both pagans and Jews, and created additional scandal by plundering gold vessels from the temple, giving some of them to the assassin Andronicus, and selling the others to surrounding cities (2 Macc. 4:25-34). When the Jews appealed to Antiochus against Andronicus, he stripped him, had him marched round the city naked, and executed him.
In 169 B.C., Jason, hearing a false rumor that Antiochus had been killed in battle in Egypt, tried unsuccessfully to oust Menelaus and regain control of Jerusalem (2 Macc. 5:5-10), even burning the gates of the city (2 Maccabees 1:7-8). Antiochus then hurried to Jerusalem with his forces to put down the uprising. At Menelaus's invitation, the king raided the temple before returning to Antioch (1 Macc. 1:20-28; 2 Macc. 5:11-16).
Two years later, Antiochus sent his general Apollonius (""Apollyon"", Revelation 9:11) to Jerusalem with a large force to increase Seleucid control over Judea. Apollonius killed multitudes of Menelaus's opponents in hiding, in a cruel attack on the Sabbath day, knowing they would refuse to fight because of their devotion to the commandment in the Torah (1 Maccabees 1:29-32; 2 Maccabees 5:24-26). He then built up Akra, ""the city of David"", a fortress citadel located near the temple, where he stationed a garrison of Syrians and Hellenized Jews (1 Maccabees 1:33-40).
This was only the beginning. Antiochus proceeded to outlaw temple sacrifices, circumcision, Sabbath and festival observance, and reading of the scriptures (I Macc. 1:41-61; 2 Macc.6:1-11). He established idolatrous pagan worship in the temple itself (2 Macc. 6:1-5). The king's men ""erected a desolating sacrilege on the altar of burnt offering."" This phrase identifies Antiochus's blasphemous sacrifices as the ""abomination of desolation"" prophesied in Daniel 11:31. 1 Maccabees 1:54. He sacrificed a pig on the altar and ordered swine's broth poured over the altar and sprinkled over all the walls and the interior of the temple and throughout the whole outer court.[5]
Historians do not know exactly why Antiochus IV persecuted the Jews so harshly. Certainly his judgment was impaired by greed and an arrogance reflected in the name he gave himself—""Epiphanes"", ""the manifest [one].""—he claimed to be a god manifest in human form. The Jews changed this title to a more fitting designation so that he came to be known as Epimanes (""the madman"").

Historical-critical textual analysis
James King West (Introduction to the Old Testament, page 467) [6] sees the story as told in the idiom of the Former Prophets and Chronicles (see 9:22 and 16:23 with 1 Kings 11 beginning verse 41) and as concerned principally with the war itself and the providential victories of the Jews.  Because the form is so similar, R. H. Pfeiffer conjectures that the author may have planned his book as a sequel to Chronicles-Ezra-Nehemiah.[7] There is no doubt that Judas is his hero, and that the book was written to show him as God's instrument to again bring deliverance to Israel. The author provides appropriate speeches and prayers to help interpret the story, to accent its important turns, to characterize the heroes. He presents copies of official documents affecting the course of his history. Their authenticity is a matter of dispute among scholars. West acknowledges that, although in the Second Book of Maccabees we have an alternate source for a considerable part of this history, 1 Maccabees is so basic to our knowledge of this period as to be indispensable, and even Josephus took it over as his main source for the period in his Antiquities of the Jews (XII, 5 to XIII, 7).
J. Alberto Soggin (Introduction to the Old Testament, page 466 [8]) wrote that the author of 1 Maccabees is never mentioned, and whoever he was, he must have composed his text in the last years of John Hyrcanus I, certainly before Pompey's occupation of Jerusalem, sometime at the end of the second to the beginning of the first century B.C.. Soggin says he was apparently a Palestinian Jew who knew Hebrew and Aramaic well; it is unknown whether he knew Greek. The book shows him to be an ardent patriot, identifying religion with nation. He notes that the last chapters of the Hebrew-Aramaic version of the protocanonical book of Daniel are modest compared to the outstanding celebration of the action of the Maccabees. Soggin observes that the author seems to have had no close contact with the sect of the Pharisees, since he never speaks of resurrection or of the messianic hope, and speculates that he wanted to write a kind of unofficial history of his time glorifying the Maccabees. Yet he does not conceal some of Simon's misdeeds, the founder of the Hasmonean dynasty: only 14.4-48 and 15:15-24 give him unqualified praise. Soggin sees the author admiring those who have made a substantial contribution towards liberating his country from Syrian oppression, but also as trying to show that they were subordinate to an historically obscure institution he mentions on a number of occasions, which he calls 'the Great Synagogue' (3.44; 14:26-28): in the last analysis it is this which decides national policy and confirms Simon in his position.
David A. deSilva (Introducing the Apocrypha, p. 248) [9] says that the book must have been written some time after the accession of John Hyrcanus in 134 B.C., since this is the last event related in the narrative. The author admires the Romans, and emphasizes the Jews' friendly relations with Rome and Rome's faithfulness as allies, which fact makes necessary a date of composition prior to 63 B.C. (he cites Oesterley 1913: 60; Goldstein 1976: 63; Fischer 1992: 441; Bartlett 1998: 34). He sees the narrated encomium of the achievements and character of the Romans earlier in 8:1-16 as contrasting sharply with later Jewish reflection on Roman conquest and rule as arrogance, insolence, and an affront against God. DeSilva points out that Pompey's entry into the holy places in 63 B.C. would have marred the author's unqualified appreciation of the Romans (he cites the comparable response of Psalms of Solomon 2; 8; 17 to that event). He observes that the conclusion to the whole work (16:23-24), while it does not necessitate a date of composition after the death of John Hyrcanus, is certainly more naturally taken that way, given that the author intentionally draws on parallels in the books of Samuel and Kings (citing Oesterley 1913: 60; Pfeiffer 1949: 301; Goldstein 1976: 63; Bartlett 1998: 33). DeSilva suggests therefore that it seems preferable to consider 1 Maccabees as having originated sometime after John Hyrcanus's death in 104 B.C. and before Roman intervention in the dispute between Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II in 63 B.C.
Lawrence H. Schiffman (Harper's Bible Commentary, p. 875 [10]) tells readers that biblical critics generally agree that the First Book of Maccabees was originally written in Hebrew, even though no manuscripts or fragments still exist in Hebrew. He says that the Greek text of 1 Maccabees has the unmistakable style of a rather literal translation from the Hebrew, and the church father Origen (A.D. third century) claimed the Hebrew title of 1 Maccabees was Sarbethsabaniel. This puzzling title, difficult to interpret, may be a slightly corrupted rendering of Hebrew sar bet 'el (""Prince of the House of God"") or of sfar bet sabanai 'el (""Book of the House of the Resisters of God""). Schiffman says most Greek manuscripts of 1 and 2 Maccabees are designated Makkabaion A and Makkabaion B, and by A.D. the second century the designation for both 1 and 2 Maccabees was To Makkabaika (""The things Maccabean"" or ""Maccabean Histories""). Clement of Alexandria, the early church father (A.D. second century), termed 1 Maccabees to Biblion ton Makkabaikon (""The Book of Things Maccabean"") and 2 Maccabees he ton Makkabaikon epitome (""The Epitome of Things Maccabean""). Although ""Maccabee"" (""hammer"") was originally the nickname of Judah the hero, Schiffman says the generally used title ""Maccabean Histories"" led to the habit of referring to all of the heroes of the book as the ""Maccabees"".
Neil J. McEleney (The Jerome Biblical Commentary, vol. 1, p. 463 [11]) writes that among the several complaints lodged against the historical reliability of 1 Maccabees, both the author's nationalism, and the exaggerated importance he gives Judean events (1:41-43; 3:27-31; 6:5-13) are said in general to make his objectivity suspect: he is anti-Seleucid (1:9-10), and he is apparently ignorant of the actual history, geography, and political organization of foreign peoples. McEleney says the author's Jewish nationalism leads him to inflate the numbers of the enemy in a way that makes the divine intervention on behalf of the Hasmoneans more striking, and says he has wrongly placed the death of Antiochus IV after the dedication of the Temple. He asserts that these historical shortcomings and others are thought to disqualify this author as an accurate reporter of the period. Nevertheless, McEleney says that he cannot be dismissed so easily. Given the context of his culture and the canons of histriography standard for the time, he is a trustworthy witness of men and events. His carefully expressed details in matters of topography (7:19; 9:2, 4, 33) and Jewish chronology (1:54; 4:52; etc.) illustrate a genuine concern to report matters accurately within the limits of his capabilities and aims. His placing of Antiochus' death is wrong, but his description of it corresponds to the independent secular witness of the historian Polybius of Megalopolis (Histories 31.9). Therefore, as Dancy notes,[12] despite his limitations, 1 Maccabee's author has ""such large stretches of honest and sober narrative that 1 Mc deserves to be regarded as equal if not superior in historical worth, not only to any book of the Old Testament but also to most surviving Hellenistic history""
Daniel J. Harrington (Invitation to the Apocrypha, p. 135 [13]) says there has been a puzzling ambivalence about 1 and 2 Maccabees in the Jewish tradition, since Hanukkah, which celebrates the cleansing and rededication of the Jerusalem temple in 164 B.C. under Judas, is part of the traditional Jewish calendar of festivals. Although it is a minor holiday (except in countries where its proximity to Christmas has made it very significant), the 'biblical basis' for it lies in books not regarded by Jews as canonical. Harrington pointedly states that the absence 1 Maccabees from the canon of Hebrew Scriptures is somewhat puzzling, since according to all the textual evidence it is likely that was originally composed in Hebrew. These puzzlements have led some scholars to suspect that there was a Jewish reaction at some point in the first century against the Maccabees and what they stood for, and a deliberate attempt to push them out of the sacred tradition of Judaism. Harrington speculates that perhaps 'messianic' claims were being made about Judas Maccabeus, or about some other figure who traced his ancestry back to the Maccabean movement. In light of failed uprising against the Romans by Jews claiming to follow the example of Judas and his brothers, the custodians of the Jewish tradition perhaps found the Maccabees too controversial and dangerous. Harrington says the relatively recent revival of interest in the Maccabees as men of action and noble warriors within the modern state of Israel suggests that these suspicions have some basis in fact.
Of the four books which pass under this name—I, II, III, and IV Maccabees—historical critics have judged, on the basis of their assessment of the available historical evidence, that the First Book of Maccabees is the only one of the four which can be regarded as a reliable historical source.

Original Language
Although there are no surviving Hebrew manuscripts of the book, scholars universally agree that it was originally written in Hebrew and subsequently translated into Greek. From the Semitic idioms which occur throughout the work it is clearly evident that 1 Maccabees was composed in a Semitic language (see, for example, 2:40; 4:2), and with great clearness certain passages indicate that the original language was Hebrew (see 2:39, 3:19). Origen and Jerome also bear testimony to this evident fact, though it is possible that the version or paraphrase known to them was Aramaic.
According to Dr. David A. deSilva (Introducing the Apocrypha, page 247), ""Translating the book back into Hebrew offers relatively few challenges and has been used to clear up difficulties in the Greek text, a fact that weighs heavily in favor of a Hebrew original standing behind the Septuagint tradition."" As shown above, the Hebrew original does not seem not to have borne the name ""Maccabees,"" and what its real designation was is not known. Eusebius (""Hist. Eccl."" vi. 25) quotes Origen as authority for the name Σαρβηθ Σαβαναι Sarbeth Sabanai, a name which has been explained in many different ways. For some of these see Grimm (""Das Erste Buch der Makkabäer,"" page xvii.[14]). Torrey (Cheyne and Black, ""Encyc. Bibl."" [15]) follow Dalman (""Grammar,"" p. 6 [16]), who takes the name as a corruption of ""Book of the Hasmoneans"". If this is the correct interpretation, an Aramaic translation of the book must have been made at an early time, and this, then, was the translation known to Origen and Jerome—a view which does not seem improbable. In any case, the Hebrew text was certainly translated very early into Greek, and the Greek only has survived. It seems to be a literal one, often preserving the Semitic, and sometimes even the Hebrew, idiom; but it is clear, on the whole, that the Greek form of the text is most probably a satisfactory translation. It is transmitted to us in three uncial manuscripts of the Septuagint—the Codex Sinaiticus, the Codex Alexandrinus, and the Codex Venetus—as well as in several cursives.

Author
No information about the author himself is obtainable beyond that which may be inferred from the book itself. The author of First Maccabees probably lived in the Holy Land, since he was very familiar with the geography of the region (some disagree) and had access to official documents that would have been archived in Jerusalem. That he was a devout and patriotic Jew who lived and wrote in Palestine is seen as proved by his intimate and exact geographical knowledge of the Holy Land (compare 3:24; 7:19; 9:2-4, 33, 34, 43; 12:36-40; 13:22, 23; 16:5, 6)—an opinion which does not accord with the opinion of Neil J. McEleney (above)—and proved also by the author's lack of accurate knowledge of any of the foreign countries which he mentions—which does accord with McEleney. As always, in Higher Critical studies, what one scholar holds to be very probable another considers to be very unlikely, even when considering the same data and the same texts.
First Maccabees was certainly written by a supporter of the Hasmoneans. The author shows himself a loyal admirer of the Hasmonean family. He believed that to this chosen family Israel owed her deliverance and existence (5:62). He admired not only the military deeds of Judas (compare 5:63), but also those of Jonathan (compare 10:15-21) and Simon (compare 14:4-15).

Date
The author's datings of all events are according to the terms of the Seleucid era which have a known correspondence to the current Gregorian calendar. The terminus a quo (earliest possible date) of the work is found in the fact that John Hyrcanus I, who began to reign in 135 B.C., is mentioned at the close of the book (16:21-24). As the Romans are presented throughout in terms of respect and friendliness, it is clear that the terminus ad quem (latest possible date) must be found at some time before the conquest of Jerusalem by Pompey in 63 B.C.. Scholars are not agreed on whether the date can be more nearly determined, and the determining fact is held by most to be the statement in 16:23, 24, that ""the rest of the acts of John...are written in the chronicles of his high-priesthood."" Many think that this implies that John had died and that a sufficient time had elapsed since his death to permit the circulation of the chronicles. Bissell (Lange's ""Commentary,"" page 479 [17]) thinks that no more than a score or two of years had passed, while Schürer (""Hist. of the Jewish People,"" div. ii., vol. iii., p. 8 [18]) and Fairweather (in ""Cambridge Bible"" [19] and Hastings, ""Dict. Bible"" [20]) think that not more than a decade or two had elapsed, and they date the work in the first or second decade of the first century B.C. Torrey, on the other hand, concludes (""Encyc. Bibl."" [15]) that this reference to the chronicle of the priesthood is an imitation of well-known passages in the Books of Kings, that it was intended solely as a compliment to John [Hyrcanus], and that the work instead was composed early in his reign (that is, soon after 135 B.C.) by one who had been an interested observer of the whole Maccabean movement. The vivid character of the narrative, and the fact that it closes so abruptly after the death of Simon, make this a very plausible view.

Sources and Integrity
A proposal for a later date of the work must account for the vivid details it contains by supposing that the writer employed older sources, such as letters and memoranda. In Torrey's view such sources are not necessary, as the author could have supplied his lack of personal knowledge, by interviewing aging participants or eyewitnesses of the events. In either case the First Book of the Maccabees is one of the best sources known for information on this period in the history of the Jews.
J. D. Michaelis insists that Josephus used the Hebrew original of the book, which differed in some important particulars from the present Greek text. Destinon (""Die Quellen des Josephus,"" 1882 [21]) revived this theory and endeavored to prove (pages 80 and following) that chapters 14-16 were not contained in the edition used by Josephus. Destinon bases his argument on the fact that Josephus treats these chapters very sparsely in comparison with his treatment of the other material of the same book, although these chapters contain just as much material and just as interesting. Wellhausen (""I. J. G."" pages 222 and following [22]) follows him. But Torrey (in ""Encyc. Bibl.""), utilizing the investigations of Mommsen,[23] demonstrates that Josephus actually knew some of this material and introduced it at a later point in his work (""Ant."" xiv. 8, § 5), in describing the history of Hyrcanus II. From all of this, it seems highly probable that the First Book of the Maccabees has retained its original form.

Literary elements
The enthusiasm of the writer at times rises to a high pitch and breaks out into poetry of a genuine Semitic character (compare 3:3-9). Seven poetic sections in the book imitate the style of classical Hebrew poetry: four laments (1:25–28, 36–40; 2:7–13; 3:45), and three hymns of praise of the ""fathers"" (2:51–64), of Judas (3:3–9), and of Simon (14:4–15). Throughout the work the style of the narrative is modeled on that of the historical books of the Old Testament: simple, terse, restrained, and objective. The fact that due weight is given and proper proportions are observed in treating the different parts of the narrative proves the author to have been a writer of considerable skill.
Throughout the work the priesthood is represented in a favorable light. The renegade priests Jason and Menelaus are not mentioned by name—a striking contrast with the treatment given them in the Second Book of the Maccabees. From these facts Abraham Geiger [24] conjectured that the author was a Sadducee, and most recent writers follow his opinion, although they fault him for calling the First Book of the Maccabees a partisan document; its temperate and just tone certainly redeems it from such a narrow evaluation. 
The narrative is told as though the victory over pagan suppression was due to the military genius of these men, exercised under the favoring guidance of God (1:64, 3:8), and not solely a divine deliverance of the people and the nation by the direct intervention of God. Curiously enough the word ""God"" does not appear in the work, nor does the word ""Lord."" However, the idea itself, as in the Book of Esther, is not lacking but is represented by ""Heaven,"" or by the pronoun ""He."" In spite of this mannerism, the author was a deeply religious man, very zealous for the Law and for his peoples' national religious institutions (see 1:11, 15, 43; 2:20-22; 3:21), for the Scriptures (1:56, 3:48), and for the Temple (1:21, 39; 3:43). Devout Jews today, in particular the Hassidic Jews, in their writing and speech, use similar circumlocutions, using the written form G-d, for example, instead of God, and in the synagogue readings, where the printed edition of the books indicate the Name with the mark  ' ' , they speak the word ""Adonai"" in place of the Tetragrammaton יהוה YHVH LORD.

Doctrine
The cultural religious teaching expressed in the book is the traditional belief of Israel, without the newer developments found in 2 Maccabees and Daniel. There is no doctrine of individual immortality as found in the Second Book of Maccabees, except for the survival of one's name and fame, and the book does not express any messianic expectation, although messianic images are applied historically to ""the days of Simon"" (1 Maccabees 14:4–17). The author insists, in accordance with true Deuteronomic tradition, on fidelity to the law as the expression of Israel's love for God. The struggle he describes is a contest, not only between Jew and Gentile, but between those who would uphold the law and those, Jews or Gentiles, who would destroy it. While he rightly condemns the Seleucid politicians for their policy of intolerant ethnic extermination of true religion, his severest condemnation goes to the lawless apostates among the people of Israel, who have been uniquely chosen by the one true God as a covenant-people, for they alone have been privileged to know and worship God, their eternal benefactor and unfailing source of help, who had warned them in the law what would happen to the community of the people if they ever turned aside from him and broke the covenant-bond he had established between him and them. The people for their part must worship the Lord alone and observe exactly the precepts of the holy law He has given to them.
There is some slight evidence in the book of an awareness of a tradition of interpreting the Written Torah according to the Oral Torah (1 Maccabees 2:40-41, 49-68; 3:20-21, 48; 4:42-47, 60; 7:12-18; 15:41-43) which centuries later was given a more developed written expression first in the Mishnah and then the Talmud. Christianity continued this tradition of interpretation of the scriptures according to the oral tradition of the ancient Christian church. See Deuteronomy 18:15-22, Jeremiah 31:31-34, Luke 10:16, 2 Thessalonians 2:15, 2 Corinthians 3:13-16, Hebrews 13:17 and 2 Peter 3:14-18.

2008 Atlantic hurricane season,https://www.conservapedia.com/2008_Atlantic_hurricane_season,"The 2008 Atlantic hurricane season was above average with 16 named storms, 8 hurricanes, 5 Major hurricanes. [1]



Date 31 of May to June 1
 Max winds 40 knots
Min central Pressure 1004 millibars
Arthur formed mid day on the 31st of May from the Remants of Alma that had made landfall a few days earlier in the Eastern Pacific, the remant LLC of Alma moved into the western Caribbean late on the 30th of May. This LLC with a tropical wave helped form a LLC off the coast of the Yucatán early on the 31st that slowly moved westward. The nhc upgraded the system once it was nearly on land, but later discovered what many 'hurricane watchers thought' when they made their report showing it had been a tropical storm over the western Caribbean for at least a few hours.  [2]


Bretha
Bertha formed from a tropical wave off of Africa durning the early part of July; it was one of the farthest east storms in Atantic hurricane history for so early in the season. It was also one of the farthest east of any storm to reach hurricane and Major hurricane strengths. Also to top it all out it was the longest July tropical cyclone ever [3]



Tropical storm Christobal


Hurricane Dolly 20–25 July
Winds 85 knots, min central pressure 963 millibars,
 Dolly formed from a tropical wave on the 20th of July around 270 n mi east of Chetumal, Mexico, and than moved west to west-northwest throughout the next couple of days through the northwestern caribbean. For some unknown reasons(nhc report) it became disorganized early on the 21st of July as a LLC could not be closed off, it reformed a LLC, and crossed the northern half of the Yucatán or just north of it during the night of the 21st, and morning of the 22nd. The upper level Anticyclone that was badly shearing it had weaken and moved away by that time; which was holding the cyclone back from strengthing over the last few days over the BOC/southern gulf of Mexico late on the 22nd and it quickly became a hurricane on the 23rd. Later that day a shortwave trough over the great lakes was digging down and created a weakness within the subtropical area of high pressure that was holding the cyclone on a west to west-northwest track for the last few days, because of this the cyclone turned northwest on the evening of the 23rd. The hurricane reached its peak at 1400z just offshore of Brownsville Texas.

A pic of Dolly at her peak [5]


26 August to 2nd of Sept
 max winds 130 knots.
Hurricane Gustav formed as a depression on the 25th of August, and it rapidly strengthen into a hurrricane by late on the 26th the next day....The storm moved onto the strip of land over southwestern Hati. Afterwards the storm weaken to a troical storm moving over mountains on the 27th of August. The storm made landfall on Southwestern Hati at near 80 knots. The storm unexpectly moved southwestward south of the NHC forecast track(it was expected to move over Cuba or even to the north earlier forecast by the nhc). Once it moved back over water after about a day over Jamaica, it become a hurricane at 12z the 29th, and 110 knots by 12z 30th the hurricane kepted strengthing with a very favorable upper level upper level wind shear and high ""TCHP"", 82-85f waters; some of the warmest waters of the whole Atlatnic basin. The hurricane peaked as it was moving onto the coast of the Isle of Youth, and Central Cuba around 22z on the 30th near 130 knots. Strong upper level shear, with the fact that it had moved over Cuba for a good 10 hours before moving into the gulf had weaken the system with the innercore becoming less organized. As this storm moved out into the Gulf of Mexico, the storm had to deal with strong southly shear, dry air at the mid levels that work together to cap any restrengthing up until the final landfall over central LA. 15z on the 1st of September it made landfall with 90 knot winds   [6]
112 deaths with 77 of those over hait. The cyclone caused over 4.4 billion in damage.

1934 Midterm Elections,https://www.conservapedia.com/1934_Midterm_Elections,"In the Midterm Elections of 1934 the Democratic Party gained nine House seats and nine Senate seats from the Republican Party, increasing their already overwhelming majorities. Although the economy had failed to recover from the Great Depression, Democrats had a series of legislative success and Franklin Roosevelt remained popular. 1934 was the first off-year elections in which a first-term president's party gained seats in both houses of Congress.

2008 U.S. presidential election analysis,https://www.conservapedia.com/2008_U.S._presidential_election_analysis,"Note: this pre-election analysis is being preserved for historical purposes.
The 2008 United States presidential election will take place on November 4, 2008. The two major tickets consist of Republicans John McCain and Sarah Palin and Democrats Barack Obama and Joe Biden. Libertarian Bob Barr and independent Ralph Nader are also running, although not as prolifically in the media as Obama or McCain.

Key demographics
In order to win, both Obama and McCain will need to turn out voters in certain demographic groups.

For McCain
 Evangelicals. The evangelical vote was critical in the election of George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004. While the evangelical community was lukewarm to McCain during the Republican primaries, the selection of conservative Sarah Palin as his running mate may help bring the evangelical vote out in greater numbers during the general election.
 Veterans. McCain's military credentials, both as a war hero while he was a POW during the Vietnam War and as an advocate for the War in Iraq, have given him a strong backing from military families. McCain's ability to draw them to the polls could bolster him in blue collar states like Ohio and Pennsylvania.
For Obama
 African-Americans. During the Democratic primary, Obama was able to draw historic levels of African-Americans to the polls, contributing to his victories over Hillary Clinton in southern states and in Virginia. While Obama's strong showings among the black community are unlikely to turn the South blue, the influx of black Democratic voters may have consequences for GOP state and congressional elections down the ticket.
 Youth. Obama's grassroots organization was conducive to drawing record numbers of young voters to his campaign during the primary season. If Obama is going to be able to counterbalance losses of blue collar and women voters in key states, he will have to be able to draw this notoriously unreliable demographic to the polls in record numbers.
For both
 Women. Hillary Clinton's ""18 million cracks"" in the glass ceiling have brought the female vote to the forefront of the 2008 election. Democrats have historically led the female vote, but Obama's prolonged battle with Hillary Clinton damaged his standings with many women. The nomination of Sarah Palin as the Republican vice president could further impact Obama's standing among female voters. For either Obama or McCain to win they must secure this toss-up demographic.
 White blue collar males. These voters are sometimes referred to as ""Reagan Democrats"" for their role in electing Reagan in 1980 and 1984, despite historically voting for Democrats since Franklin D. Roosevelt's time. Although Bill Clinton was able to win the presidency without winning them, their high numbers in battleground states like Ohio and Pennsylvania make them a vital group for both candidates in the 2008 election.
 Hispanics: Republicans have strong in-roads with the Hispanic vote. Bush captured the Hispanic vote in 2000 and 2004 and McCain's moderate immigration stance may win him some points within the community. Barack Obama's efforts in swaying their vote have diminished the margin somewhat, giving him a possible edge in momentum. Given their high populations in Western battleground states like New Mexico, Nevada and Colorado their role in the election will be more pronounced than previous cycles.  A Democracy Corps poll from July 11 - August 3 [1] in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Nevada showed Obama leading McCain by 45 percentage points, 69% - 24%.
Individual states
Certain states in which the vote has been historically close between the Democrats and the Republicans are called battleground states. Their unique demographic and electoral histories provide unique challenges to both candidates in capturing them.

The big three
 Ohio: Ohio voted for George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004, but by very slim margins. The strength of blue collar workers in Ohio voted with Hillary Clinton during the Democratic primary, giving McCain an opening by which he can hold this barely-red state. However, Obama may be able to galvanize Ohio's large youth and college population to off-set the blue collar vote to give himself a slim lead in the state. No matter what happens, this state will be close.
 Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania's large blue collar population may also aid McCain here if he manages to secure that demographic. Unlike Ohio, Pennsylvania has the large cities of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh which Obama won overwhelmingly in the primaries despite losing the state at large. If Obama can turn out the African-American vote in the two cities and hold the more liberal suburban counties he may be able to eke out a slim victory here like John Kerry in 2004.
 Florida: The center of controversy in the 2000 election, Bush managed to carry the state again in 2004. The lack of campaigning here by Obama during the primary, a large Cuban-American voter bloc opposed to his calls for talks with Fidel Castro, and an influential Jewish population uncomfortable with his Iran and Israel approaches will make it extraordinarily difficult for Obama to capture the state.
Others
 Nevada: Nevada is considered the most libertarian state in the United States, which allowed Bush to take its 5 electoral votes in 2000 and 2004 albeit by slimmer and slimmer margins. However, McCain faces serious challenges. During the primaries Ron Paul did extremely well in the rural counties, coming in second overall behind Mitt Romney. At the GOP state convention, Ron Paul supporters clashed with the GOP establishment over the state's allocation of delegates to John McCain, disaffecting many of them from the party. The Democrats, whose voters are concentrated in Reno and Las Vegas, registered more Democrats than Republicans during the primaries and benefit from the state's high Latino and union member populations. If those who voted for Ron Paul instead vote for the Libertarian candidate Bob Barr in the general election, McCain could end up losing this important bellwether for the West.
 Virginia: Once safely Republican as part of the ""Solid South"", the state went for Barack Obama in the Democratic primary by a wide margin. The increasingly liberal northern part of the state, whose suburbs border Washington, D.C., played a key role in that victory. If Obama manages to bring those northern suburbs to the polls and draw out the African-American vote in record numbers, he could squeak out a victory here to capture Virginia's 13 electoral votes.

1996 welfare reform law,https://www.conservapedia.com/1996_welfare_reform_law,"The Welfare Reform Act of 1996 ended most welfare and angered many of Clinton's more liberal constituents. It changed the welfare system into one requiring work in exchange for time-limited assistance (see Work requirements).  
It contained a performance bonus to reward states for moving welfare recipients into jobs, state maintenance of effort requirements, and support for families moving from welfare to work.
The 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWOR) (PL 104-193), also called the ""Welfare Reform Act,"" became law on August 22, 1996 with the signature of President Bill Clinton.

2012 Republican Primaries,https://www.conservapedia.com/2012_Republican_Primaries,"The 2012 Republican Primary were won by Mitt Romney. They are the Republican Party's primary to decide who will run against Obama in the 2012 presidential election.  Currently, there are four candidates in the running: RINO Mitt Romney, family values conservative Rick Santorum, conservative Newt Gingrich and libertarian Ron Paul.  For sometime Romney was ahead in the polls, but many Republicans hoped a more conservative candidate would gain the nomination causing Newt to gain the lead briefly, but then Santorum surged. Ultimately, the goal of the Republicans in 2012 is to defeat President Barack Obama which will take a strong conservative candidate. See: Presidential Election 2012.

133rd Littorio Armoured Division,https://www.conservapedia.com/133rd_Littorio_Armoured_Division,"The 133rd ""Littorio"" Armoured Division was formed in Parma at the end of 1937 by merging the 1st Celere Division into the existing Littorio infantry division. Littorio was the third Italian armoured division formed after the Centauro and Ariete.
The Littorio Infantry Division had fought in the Spanish Civil War as a unit of regulars that had largely volunteered for service. On its return to Italy it was converted to an armoured formation. Its name comes from lictor, the name of those who carried the fasces, the rod-and-axes symbol adopted by Benito Mussolini from ancient Rome.
The Littorio Armoured Division first saw action in the April 1941 invasion of southern Yugoslavia and performed quite well. The Italian Armoured Corps had been designed to defeat the Yugoslavs, and it did so. It was never intended for desert operations, but the need in Libya and Egypt for armoured formations soon become urgent. At the end of 1941 Littorio was shipped to North Africa. The division arrived in Tripoli by March 1942.
A battlegroup from the Littorio arrived at the front on 20 June 1941, as the British defences were collapsing, and took part in the final attack on Tobruk.
The Littorio took part in the Battle of Mersa Matruh and was destroyed during the Second Battle of El Alamein. The remnants merged into the Ariete Tactical Group, which continued fighting in Libya and Tunisia into April 1943.

.50 BMG,https://www.conservapedia.com/.50_BMG,"The .50 BMG or .50 Browning Machine Gun or 12.7×99mm NATO is one of the most powerful rifle cartridges ever developed. It was first developed in 1910 by Browning for the Browning .50 caliber machine gun. Along with the 7.62x51mm, it is one of the most popular rounds for sniper rifles and long-range target practice. It is also still used for military and civilian use in .50-caliber machine guns.
According to Boston's Gun Bible, the .50 BMG is most commonly used by civilians in single shot bolt action rifles or semi-automatic target and hunting rifles. Boston T. Party says it is very popular with civilians in long-distance (1000-1500 yard) shooting matches. The .50 BMG throws a 700 gr bullet at 2800 fps for 12,1890 fpe. According to Boston T. Party, ""In 1998 and 2000 I predicted that the .50 BMG round would come under increased scrutiny, and I was right. If you can't afford a .50 BMG rifle, then at least buy some ammo""[1] such as the High Explosive Incendiary/Armor Piercing Ammunition (HEIAP). According to Boston, handloading is common among .50 BMG gun enthusiasts.

1

And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.






2

And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he Will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD.






3

And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.






4

And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?






5

And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.






6

And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed is before him.






7

But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.






8

Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.






9

Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.






10

Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.






11

And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.






12

And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.






13

Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.






14

But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.






15

And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.






16

Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.






17

And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.






18

Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him.






19

Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which is with the sheep.






20

And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.






21

And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.






22

And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.






23

And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.

1

Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.






2

And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.






3

And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.






4

And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.






5

And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.






6

And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders.






7

And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.






8

And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.






9

If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.






10

And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.






11

When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.






12

Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Beth-lehem-judah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul.






13

And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.






14

And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.






15

But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.






16

And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.






17

And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren;






18

And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.






19

Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.






20

And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle.






21

For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army.






22

And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren.






23

And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard them.






24

And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.






25

And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.






26

And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?






27

And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.






28

And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.






29

And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?






30

And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.






31

And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him.






32

And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.






33

And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.






34

And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:






35

And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.






36

Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.






37

David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with thee.






38

And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.






39

And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.






40

And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.






41

And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him.






42

And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.






43

And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.






44

And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.






45

Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.






46

This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.






47

And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give you into our hands.






48

And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.






49

And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.






50

So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.






51

Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.






52

And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.






53

And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.






54

And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.






55

And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.






56

And the king said, Inquire thou whose son the stripling is.






57

And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.






58

And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.

1

And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.






2

And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house.






3

Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.






4

And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.






5

And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants.






6

And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick.






7

And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.






8

And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?






9

And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.






10

And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in Saul's hand.






11

And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice.






12

And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul.






13

Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.






14

And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him.






15

Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.






16

But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.






17

And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD's battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.






18

And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?






19

But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife.






20

And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.






21

And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain.






22

And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son in law.






23

And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?






24

And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David.






25

And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.






26

And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not expired.






27

Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.






28

And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal Saul's daughter loved him.






29

And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David's enemy continually.






30

Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.

And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David.






2

But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:






3

And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee.






4

And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to theeward very good:






5

For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?






6

And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain.






7

And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past.






8

And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him.






9

And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with his hand.






10

And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin; but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.






11

Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain.






12

So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.






13

And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.






14

And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.






15

And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.






16

And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster.






17

And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?






18

So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.






19

And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.






20

And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.






21

And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also.






22

Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah.






23

And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.






24

And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?

1

And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?






2

And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.






3

And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.






4

Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee.






5

And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.






6

If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.






7

If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him.






8

Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?






9

And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?






10

Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy father answer thee roughly?






11

And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.






12

And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew it thee;






13

The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with my father.






14

And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not:






15

But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.






16

So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies.






17

And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.






18

Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.






19

And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.






20

And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.

And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the LORD liveth.






22

But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.






23

And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever.






24

So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat.






25

And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty.






26

Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.






27

And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?






28

And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem:






29

And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king's table.






30

Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?






31

For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.






32

And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?






33

And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.






34

So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.






35

And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.






36

And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.






37

And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?






38

And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.






39

But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.






40

And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city.






41

And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.






42

And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.

1

Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?






2

And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place.






3

Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of bread in mine hand, or what there is present.






4

And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.






5

And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.






6

So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.






7

Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.






8

And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.






9

And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.






10

And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.






11

And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?






12

And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.






13

And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.






14

Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore then have ye brought him to me?






15

Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?

1

David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him.






2

And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.






3

And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.






4

And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold.






5

And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.






6

When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;)






7

Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;






8

That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?






9

Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.






10

And he inquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.






11

Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.






12

And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord.






13

And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?






14

Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king's son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine house?






15

Did I then begin to inquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.






16

And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house.






17

And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD; because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not shew it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD.






18

And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.






19

And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.






20

And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.






21

And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD's priests.






22

And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father's house.






23

Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard.

1992 Presidential Election,https://www.conservapedia.com/1992_Presidential_Election," Bill Clinton and George H. W. Bush In the 1992 presidential election, President George H. W. Bush stood for reelection.  He had received strong support for the way he had handled foreign relations during his term in office, but the economy had slumped.  Bush had the confidence of the Republican Party, which nominated him for reelection after he easily brushed aside a campaign by Pat Buchanan.  
The Democrats, after a more protracted primary season, nominated young Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, as their candidate. Clinton and his wife Hillary Rodham Clinton who promised ""two for the price of one"" perpetrated a myth that he was a Rhodes Scholar and she a ""defender of children"".[1]
Wealthy oil-businessman named Ross Perot also ran as an independent bringing together a new Reform Party. The candidates appeared in several live televised Presidential Debates, which included not only the two major party candidates but also the sometimes quirky, but very charismatic, Perot who proved to have a ""folksy"" delivery that gave him a strong following. Clinton won a majority of the Electoral College despite receiving only a plurality of the popular vote after Perot was able to garner almost 20% of the vote.

Campaign
Bush enjoyed historically high approval ratings after his decisive military victory in Operation Desert Storm in 1991, but that had evaporated by the time of the election. Ironically, the fall of the Berlin Wall and collapse of the Soviet Union under Bush's Presidency hurt him in his reelection campaign in that it resulted in foreign policy not being a prominent issue, with no Soviet threat. The campaign focused almost entirely on domestic concerns and an economy that was believed to still be in a recession.
A prominently placed sign in Clinton's campaign headquarters read ""It’s the economy, stupid!"" Bill Clinton ran a different, more youthful campaign, by making frequent appearances on MTV and daytime talk-shows, and took questions from live audiences, which proved to be a comfortable setting for him. He distanced himself from past Democratic Party candidates like George McGovern, Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis, by running as a centrist. He cited the ticket's support of the death penalty, a balanced budget, middle class tax cuts and a desire to ""end welfare as we know it.""  Clinton had baggage of avoiding the Vietnam War, illegally failing to report for the draft, and past drug use, but the mainstream media didn't push those themes.
According to Wikipedia, Bill Clinton engaged in voter suppression by appearing at several Massachusetts polling locations, which caused voters hours of delay and inhibited traffic.[2] Clinton was allegedly electioneering within 150 feet of the polling locations, which is also illegal according to Massachusetts state law.[3]
George H. W. Bush trailed in the polls for the entire campaign. Several of his speeches and political ads focused on the Gulf War, fall of the Berlin Wall and experience to illustrate his success as commander in chief, but his message did little to help his standing.  
Bush was widely blamed for a downturn in the economy that did not actually happen.[4] Worse, he was held responsible by conservative voters for reneging on his pledge, ""Read my lips—no new taxes"". He agreed to a major tax hike. More moderate and less charismatic than Reagan, Bush had no personal following could do little to find an issue to energize his party or the American people.  In the debates he stressed the idea of the American people giving him a Republican Congress to work with, which at the time seemed out of touch as the Democrats enjoyed large leads in both the House and the Senate.  His campaign never caught fire.  Attempts to paint Clinton as a tax-and-spend liberal governor with no foreign policy experience didn't resonate. Bush never found a way to deal with Perot.
In Ross Perot's surprisingly strong third-party campaign he ran as a crusading expert—a successful businessman—who was qualified to fix the economy and the huge federal budget deficits. Perot argued that deficits were a kind of corruption, and represented a failure that could no longer be tolerated. He damaged the Bush campaign by asserting that the economy was worse than it was and giving disenchanted voters who didn't want to support Clinton a protest vote.

Analysis
The 1992 election was unique for a number of reasons: a perception that economic conditions were worse than they actually were, which harmed incumbent President Bush; a strong third-party candidate in Perot who won over alienated conservatives by arguing 12 years of Republican rule had only raised the deficit; and, perhaps most importantly, Bill Clinton's ability to unite not only the Democratic Party, but a number of heterogeneous coalitions, much as Franklin Roosevelt, also a consummate politician, did in the New Deal Coalition after 1932.[6]

In the uprising, members of Akromiya, with support from Hizb ut-Tahrir and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan raided a police station, killing several guards and taking a large quantity of military equipment.  Not long afterward the militants raided a prison and freed more than 500 prisoners, including several imprisoned Islamists.  The militants then set fire to the city's main cinema, forcing patrons and nearby residents to run into the main city square.  After civilians fleeing the burning building entered the square, militants members took them as hostages, beating, torturing, and using them as literal human shields by tying them to the perimeter of the city square with wire.  Ill-prepared Uzbek troops fired on the square, but due to their poor training killed an estimated 45 civilians.  The militants filmed themselves throughout the event, showing that they were heavily armed, but were later seen putting down their weapons before fleeing to refugee camps in Kyrgyzstan.  On the video, several men were heard shouting ""Allahu Akbar"", taking hostages (including two human rights activists) and throwing grenades.  In total 176 people were killed; 79 Islamists, 45 civilians, and 31 Uzbekistani soldiers; although some groups claim 187 people were killed.[1][2][3]

15th amendment,https://www.conservapedia.com/15th_amendment,"To former abolitionists and to the Radical Republicans in Congress who fashioned Reconstruction after the Civil War, the Fifteenth Amendment, enacted in 1870, appeared to signify the fulfillment of all promises to African Americans. Set free by the Thirteenth Amendment, with citizenship guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, black males were given the vote by the Fifteenth Amendment. From that point on, the freedmen were generally expected to fend for themselves. In retrospect, it can be seen that the Fifteenth Amendment was in reality only the beginning of a struggle for equality that would continue for more than a century before African Americans could begin to participate fully in American public and civic life.
African Americans exercised the franchise and held office in many Southern states through the 1880s, but in the early 1890s, steps were taken to ensure subsequent “white supremacy.” Literacy tests for the vote, “grandfather clauses” excluding from the franchise all whose ancestors had not voted in the 1860s, and other devices to disenfranchise African Americans were written into the constitutions of former Confederate states. Social and economic segregation were added to black America’s loss of political power. In 1896 the Supreme Court decision Plessy v. Ferguson legalized “separate but equal” facilities for the races. For more than 50 years, the overwhelming majority of African American citizens were reduced to second-class citizenship under the “Jim Crow” segregation system. During that time, African Americans sought to secure their rights and improve their position through organizations such as National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the National Urban League and through the individual efforts of reformers like Booker T. Washington, W.E.B. DuBois, and A. Philip Randolph. 
The most direct attack on the problem of African American disfranchisement came in 1965. Prompted by reports of continuing discriminatory voting practices in many Southern states, President Lyndon B. Johnson, himself a southerner, urged Congress on March 15, 1965, to pass legislation “which will make it impossible to thwart the Fifteenth Amendment.” He reminded Congress that “we cannot have government for all the people until we first make certain it is government of and by all the people.” The Voting Rights Act of 1965, extended in 1970, 1975, 1982, and 2006, abolished all remaining deterrents to exercising the franchise and authorized Federal supervision of voter registration where necessary.
The Fifteenth Amendment was the last of the Reconstruction amendments after the Civil War.  There would not be any new amendments until the 20th century.

19th-century,https://www.conservapedia.com/19th-century,"The 19th century was the time period between 1801 and 1900. It was a busy time, because lots of things were going on at once. For example, there was the War of 1812, the Civil War, the American Indian Genocide, the Mexican War, and the Spanish-American War, all in the 19th century. The 19th century was also the time of cowboys and Indians in the West, and the Industrial Revolution in the East. Also, the United States was rapidly expanding during this time. The majority of states entered the Union during this time period.
In the arts, the 19th century saw the rise of Romanticism.
Britain was one of the most powerful nations during the 19th century, controlling Canada, parts of Africa, India, Hong Kong, and Australia.
Other major powers included France, which controlled most of North Africa and part of Canada and Asia; Belgium, whose territories included much of Central Africa, Asia, South America, and New Zealand; Holland, who dominated the spice and tea trades from the Azores and the Solomon Islands, and the Ottoman Empire, which covered a land mass equivalent to 20 times the size of Wales but was past its zenith and was backwards in comparison to the industrialized nations of Europe.

.zipx,https://www.conservapedia.com/.zipx,"A compressed file is any kind of computer file which has been optimized to consume less drive space that usual using the process of data compression.  Since there is so much redundant data in any large file, compressed files can consume.

Contents

1 Advantages
2 Disadvantages
3 Common file extensions
4 References


Advantages
Storage space is conserved
Network communication can be reduced
Disadvantages
In some cases, compression can be potentially harmful.  These include:

Flash memory wear: Flash Drives, Secure Digital (SD) cards, and solid-state drives can wear out more quickly due to the increased read/write operations required[1]
Increased file vulnerability: A single lost of corrupted bit can result in the entire file being destroyed
Increased drive vulnerability: If an entire drive is compressed (an option which Windows makes easy in its modern versions) then this problem can be magnified—a lost bit or two can cause the entire contents of the drive to be destroyed.
Additionally, compressing files (or file systems) requires more work from the computer's processor, so this tends to decrease the operating speed on the computer while it is accessing such files.

Common file extensions
When a file or group of files is compressed, it is stored in an archive file using a specific format, which will be marked as such by a file extension.  Common file extensions include:

.zip
.zipx
.7z
.cab
.dmg
.pea

1979 Grand Mosque Siege,https://www.conservapedia.com/1979_Grand_Mosque_Siege,"The Grand Mosque in Mecca (home of the Kaaba) was briefly taken over for a period of weeks by an obscure group led by a poorly educated Bedouin named Juhayman[1] whose theology was an early manifestation of modern violent Salafism. These believers did not embrace many aspects of modern society. They opposed identity cards and passports because these denote loyalty to an entity other than Allah. They were against images of living beings, not only on television and in photography but also on coins. The only previous violent encounter was when a group of young activists were caught smashing shop display windows showing female mannequins in the center of Medina in 1965. And they had peculiar views on ritual practices setting them apart from other religious communities and the religious establishment.
The incident revealed the Saudi state was thoroughly unprepared to deal with a challenge to its legitimacy from conservative religious believers.[2] After three days of fruitless negotiations, the Saudi's turned to external, non-Islamic ""crusader"" forces to dislodge the jihadis. Non-Muslims are not allowed within the city of Mecca, and bloodshed on the grounds of the temple is considered virtually an unpardonable sin; yet the Saudi state and its reigning religious establishment deputized, through a fatwa, the French Special Operations Forces to retake the mosque.[3][4]
Official reports say that 255 fanatics, troops and pilgrims were killed, while 560 were injured. The rebels who survived were imprisoned or beheaded, with reports claiming 63 beheadings.
The respected imam Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani, who abhorred violence, condemned Juhayman's attack; however one of his students, Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi, fell under the influence of Juhayman's thought. In coming years Maqdisi further developed the idea that the ruling Saudi clan were apostate Muslim infidels along with a rejection of the very idea of a nation state.[5]

1 Esdras,https://www.conservapedia.com/1_Esdras,"The First Book of Esdras (III Esdras) is found in the books of the Septuagint, the Old Testament accepted as inspired and canonical by the Orthodox Church in the Greek Orthodox Bible, and found in the books of the Old Testament of the Vulgate. It is included in the canon of the Ethiopian Orthodox Bible where it is called Ezra Kali which means ""2 Ezra."" It was not included in the canon of scripture by the Third Council of Carthage (397). Since the Council of Trent it is not accepted as inspired and canonical by the Catholic Church in the Catholic Bible—books of the Bible accepted as divinely inspired by the majority of Christian believers in the United States and throughout the world.[1][2][3]
I Esdras was first removed from the Old Testament and placed in the Apocrypha by Martin Luther in the 16th century. The First Book of Esdras is regarded as canonical and inspired by about 12% of Christian believers.[3]

Name and canonical status
""Esdras"" is the Greek word for ""Ezra"". In the Septuagint it is called ΕΣΔΡΑΣ Α, ESDRAS Ι (the book of 1 Esdras), followed by ΕΣΔΡΑΣ Β, ESDRAS ΙΙ (the book of Ezra), and ΝΕΕΜΙΑΣ, NEHEMIAS (the book of Nehemiah). Most current Ecumenical editions of the Bible give the names of these three books as ""1 Esdras"", ""Ezra"" and ""Nehemiah"". Jerome's Vulgate places this book after Nehemiah, in the order Ezra, Nehemiah, and 1 Esdras. Thus, in printed Latin and English Bibles of the 17th through 18th and 19th centuries, I Esdras (1 Esdras) is found listed as III Esdras (3 Esdras)—the canonical Book of Ezra is called I Esdras (1 Esdras), and the canonical Book of Nehemiah is called II Esdras (2 Esdras), hence this book is designated III Esdras (3 Esdras). Some versions of the Bible combine Ezra and Nehemiah as one book called either ""Ezra"" or ""I Esdras"". In the Slavonic editions of the Bible the book I Esdras (not Ezra) is called ""2 Esdras""; in the Vulgate where Ezra and Nehemiah are separately I Esdras and II Esdras, this book is called ""3 Esdras""; and in the Ethiopian Orthodox Bible it is called Ezra Kali which means ""2 Ezra."" The variant names of this book have been a source of some confusion for many beginning students of the Bible.

The first verse of 1 Esdras in English is:1:1 And Josias held the feast of the passover in Jerusalem unto his Lord, and offered the passover the fourteenth day of the first month
The book of 1 Esdras (3 Esdras) was widely quoted by Josephus, as well as early Christian authors. Use of the book continued in the Eastern Church, and it remains a part of the Eastern Orthodox canon. It was included in Origen's Hexapla, which placed various versions of the Old Testament side by side. However, it was not included in early canons of the Western Church. In the late sixteenth century, after the Council of Trent (1545-1563), Pope Clement VIII relegated the work to an appendix following the New Testament in the Vulgate ""lest [it] perish entirely."" It is listed among the Apocrypha in Article VI of the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England (1563).[4] It is regarded as apocryphal by Jews, Catholics, and most Protestants.

Variant names of the book
Various problems of naming 1 Esdras today are evident. Most editions of the Septuagint give its Greek title as Εσδρας Α′ (1 Esdras), and it is placed before Εσδρας Β′ (2 Esdras), which is the combined traditional books of Ezra and Nehemiah, titled together as  Εσδρας Β′ (2 Esdras). However, the Latin Vulgate version of the Bible titled the books of Ezra and Nehemiah as ""1 and 2 Esdras,"" giving the current book the title ""3 Esdras"" instead of the Septuagint denomination of ""1 Esdras"".
Since most modern translations use the more Hebraic transliteration of ""Ezra"" for the canonical Book of Ezra, the Vulgate's ""3 Esdras"" is now called 1 Esdras in most English Bibles with Apocrypha. The Vulgate's 4 Esdras, meanwhile, has become 2 Esdras in the Apocrypha.

Source and composition
1 Esdras draws most of its text from the books of Ezra and 2 Chronicles and Nehemiah. New material in 1 Esdras not found in these 3 canonical texts offers some legendary background of the Jewish leader Zerubbabel while he was in Babylon, and relates the story of how Zerubbabel in the court of King Darius defeated two other young noblemen in an intellectual contest on the topic of what is most powerful (the most powerful is truth), and won as his prize the king's permission to lead another wave of Jewish exiles back to Jerusalem. 1 Esdras represents a summary view of the establishment of Second Temple Judaism as a providential renewal of God's covenant with the Jews. Also, its additional information on Zerubbabel shows that he was an important figure to many Second Temple Jews. 1 Esdras has a more polished conclusion than that of the much shorter Book of Ezra.
An anonymous Jewish writer in Egypt compiled the text most probably around 150 B.C.. 1 Esdras is  a Greek translation of older Hebrew texts, occasionally updating the older text and adding some new material. It was circulated widely among the Jews of the diaspora and is included in the Septuagint collection of Jewish scriptures, which was created in Alexandria, Egypt. However, after the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem in A.D. 70, rabbinical authorities rejected the Septuagint, giving primacy to the original Hebrew texts, and eventually excluding even some of these as not canonical. Thus, 1 Esdras and some of the other books in the Septuagint came to be excluded from the Jewish canon of scripture. However, since educated Christians of the 1st and 2nd centuries generally knew Greek and used the Septuagint, it was the foundational Scripture in the ancient Christian Church for determining what books belonged in the Christian version of the ""Old Testament"".
The oldest extant manuscripts of the entire Christian Bible are written in Greek, the language of the apostles and the early Christian Church, representing the text of the Holy Bible as it was before the time of Jerome's 5th century Vulgate translation of the scriptures into Latin. These are the Codex Vaticanus, the Codex Sinaiticus, and the Codex Alexandrinus. They demonstrate that all of the books and parts of books that have been separated and designated as Apocrypha since the 16th century were included as integral parts of the whole Bible as handed down from the time of the apostles without any distinction or difference, as sacred scripture.[5]

Content
While most of the content of 1 Esdras closely parallels the books of Ezra, Nehemiah, and 2 Chronicles, the writer changes the order of some sections, updates the text to suit his theological views, and adds significant new material, particularly in chapters 3–5. The book's contents can be summarized as follows.
Chapter 1 ( = 2 Chron 35:1-36:21). Josiah's celebration of Passover and his death. 1 Esdras states it was the prophet Jeremiah, not Pharaoh Necho II, whom God inspired to warn Josiah not to attack Egyptian forces en route to Babylon. Josiah's death is thus attributed to his disobedience to a command from God through a known prophet, rather than from God through the Egyptian king. Then the history of Jerusalem unto its destruction and the Babylonian exile of the Jews.
Chapter 2:1-14 ( = Ezra 1:1-11). Cyrus authorizes the Jews of Babylon to return to Jerusalem.
Chapter 2:15-26 ( = Ezra 4:7-24). The first attempt of the Jews to rebuild the Temple is blocked by Samaritan opposition.
Chapter 3:1-5:3 (original). The story of Zerubbabel as the Jewish deliverer. Three young courtiers of King Darius debate what is the strongest thing in the kingdom, the winner of the debate to receive great honor and favors from Darius. One of the courtiers is Zerubbabel, a descendant of the Jewish King David. The three publicly debate the matter before the king and his court. The first holds that wine is strongest, the second claims the king is the strongest, and Zerubbabel declares that it is women who are strongest, but that Truth is stronger than women. Darius concurs with Zerubbabel and grants his request to be appointed leader of a new wave of Jewish exiles from Babylon to Jerusalem to complete the restoration of the Temple. Zerubbabel arrives in Jerusalem from Babylon (1 Esdras 5:5)
Chapter 5:4-6 (original). Beginning of a list of exiles who returned.
""And all the people gave a great shout of praise to the Lord, because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid."" (Ezra 3:11 and 1 Esdras 5:62)
Chapter 5:7-73 ( = Ezra 2:1-4:5). An extensive list of exiles returning with Zerubbabel. Beginning of Temple reconstruction and Zerubbabel's rejection of Samaritan assistance, followed by their opposition and another interruption of building.
Chapter 6-7:9 ( = Ezra 5:1-6:18). Correspondence between the governor of Syria and Darius regarding authorization to rebuild the Temple, followed by the completion of construction.
Chapter 7:10-15 ( = Ezra 6:19-22). Dedication of the Temple and the celebration of Passover.
Chapter 8:1-9:36 ( = Ezra 7:1-10:44). Return of additional exiles under Ezra, as the agent of king Artaxerxes. Ezra's preaching and legislation against mixed marriages requires Jewish men divorce their Gentile wives and send them away with their children.
Chapter 9:37-55 ( = Nehemiah 7:73-8:12). Ezra reads the Law, reaffirming God's covenant with the Jews.

Historical-critical textual analysis
Josephus used 1 Esdras in his Jewish history. Some scholars believe it was likely composed in the first century B.C. or as late as A.D. the first century. However, most place it earlier, around 150 B.C.. The writer updated his historical information to reflect his theological views.
Many Protestant and Catholic scholars see no historical value in the ""original"" sections of the book, thought by them to resemble those accounts in the Book of Daniel which they consider legendary. However, citations in 1 Esdras of the other books of the Bible are of considerable value to textual scholars, providing a unique, pre-Septuagint translation of those texts. 1 Esdras also provides important insights into the character of Second Temple Judaism, and the importance of the figure of Zerubbabel which otherwise would be harder to discern.
An apparent ignorance of the historical sequence of events, attributable to its author(s), presents a difficulty. Artaxerxes is mentioned before Darius, who is mentioned before Cyrus. The person called ""Attharias"" and ""Attharates"" in the text (5:40; 9:49) is apparently a Greek transliteration of a word meaning ""governor,"" which is used for Nehemiah in the Book of Nehemiah (8:9; 10:1 ""Tirshatha"" in KJV). So Nehemiah does not appear by name in 1 Esdras.
The various discrepancies in the account suggest to many scholars that the work has more than one author. In the current Greek texts, the book breaks off in the middle of a sentence, and the verse had to be reconstructed from an early Latin translation. It is generally presumed that the original work continued to the Feast of Tabernacles, as described in Nehemiah 8:13-18, and that this portion of the text was lost.

110th Congress,https://www.conservapedia.com/110th_Congress," The Zogby International Poll reported a ""paltry 11 percent rated Congress positively, beating the previous low of 14 percent in July."" [1]
The Democratic party which gained control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2006 Congressional midterm elections had promised major reforms within the first 100 hours. One reform in particular was lobbying and ethics reform—a key plank in the fall 2006 campaign.  Democrats vowed greater openness in the Congressional Appropriations process, and an end to so-called ""earmarks,"" an appropriation designated to spend specific money on a specific project in a specific members district, sometimes designating a specific private business concern to whom the money is to be spent with. Several Republican members had been caught up in so-called earmark scandals, trading money for influence, and this was widely accredited as a key reason why the GOP lost control of the House after a dozen years.

Achievements
In the first five months of 2007 after the Democratic party took control of Congress, the majority party,

 Reissued a ""blank check"" to the President on the Iraq War, which allegedly was opposed by 70 percent [2] in opinion polls and was vociferously opposed by many Congressional candidates in 2006. The bill included an increase in the minimum wage.
 Successfully renamed six post offices, four courthouses, a national park, and one of the buildings housing the Department of Education in Washington. They also extended the lives of two government commissions, reduced the membership of the Red Cross board of governors from 50 to 20, and authorized construction of 541 feet of road on a flood plain in St. Louis County, Missouri. 
Kept the government going with two temporary spending bills, completed one appropriations bill which was vetoed, redesignated five Eastern European countries (Albania, Macedonia, Croatia, Georgia and Ukraine) for security aid, and passed a bill on penalties for animal fighting that had passed in the Republican Congress last year. 
Voted to kill lobbying reforms that were part of the 2006 Honest Leadership and Open Government Act Democratic candidates made a centerpiece of their campaign message in 2006.[3]
Passed a bill to allow federal funding of stem cell research on lines of stem cells derived from discarded human embryos created for fertility treatments.  The bill caused the first veto of Bush's presidency.
Passed a bipartisan bill expanding the State Children's Health Insurance Program, increasing coverage by 4 million people by 2012.  After a Bush veto, Congress passed a second version which was also vetoed by the President.
Passed the appropriations bill to fund the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education for 2008.  It was vetoed by the President and did not pass an override.
By mid June 2007, Congressional Approval ratings had hit a new low, with only 23% of the American people expressing approval, worse than President George W. Bush had experienced.[4]  The L.A. Times reported Congressional Approval ratings were the lowest in a decade—since the Clinton Impeachment trial.[5]

Earmark reform
A House ethics panel is led by a lawmaker who holds the record for taking the most free travel, while another panel member was implicated in the recent flap over the firing of U.S. attorneys.  The earmark process by which so-called ""pork barrel"" projects are doled out to members by June 2007 saw no major changes.  In fact, rules approved the first day in power in January, the Associated Press reported, where being ignored. Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, instructed members to withhold ""earmark requests"" until September. 
According to the Associated Press, what Obey did ran counter to new rules Democrats promised that would make spending decisions more open. Those rules made it clear that projects earmarked for federal dollars and their sponsors were to be made available to public scrutiny. The rules also require lawmakers requesting such projects to provide a written explanation describing their requests and a letter certifying that they or their spouse would not make any financial gain from them.  The greater transparency was intended to lead to more self-discipline on the part of lawmakers.[6]  Two weeks later, a group called Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW) reported that after a wave of protest from across the political spectrum, Democrats backed down from plans to keep taxpayers in the dark about tens of billions of dollars in congressionally earmarked spending. CAGW President Tom Schatz said  
“Chairman Obey wanted to stay behind closed doors and play ‘God’ with earmarks, but the taxpayers won this battle for transparency and accountability.” [7]
The legislative journal, The Hill, reported Sen. Carl Levin and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton were the two top Senatorial pork barrel  reciepients via the earmark process in 2007.[8]

Tax increases
House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell of Michigan announced a proposal for a new carbon tax that would increase the gasoline tax by 50 cents.  In addition to raising the gasoline tax, Dingell’s new proposal would institute a “double digit” tax on each ton of carbon dioxide emitted.[9]
The Wall Street Journal reported in April House Ways and Means Chairman Charlie Rangel effectively declared the death of Reaganomics in America.  Democrats have come up with an idea to slow the 17 million middle class Americans subject Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT).  Changes in the AMT rate, and the treatment of dividends and capital gains, still leaves the budget at least $600 billion short of paying for the AMT fix. House Democrats have acknowledged that to close this final gap, they will have to consider raising  personal income taxes.
The top AMT rate would increase to 31.5% from 28%. Democratic tax experts also recommend eliminating the lower rate for capital gains and dividends for those subject to the AMT. This would raise the capital gains tax rate to about 31% from its present 15% rate.[10]

1 Samuel,https://www.conservapedia.com/1_Samuel,"The general subject of I Samuel is the foundation and development of the Kingdom of Israel. The history of Samuel being intended to explain the circumstances which brought about the establishment of the monarchal form of government. The author is guided by a leading idea in the choice of his matter and that his main object is not to give a detailed history of the first two kings of Israel, but to relate the Providential foundation of a permanent royal dynasty in the family of David. By accounting Saul's reign the author shows that first he was elected then after a time was found wanting (by God), finally being rejected in favor of David. The history shows the struggle between David and Saul (and his house) is intended to reveal David as the chosen of the Lord, evidenced by being miraclously saved from imminent dangers and how he ultimately triumphed, while Saul perished with his house.

Evidence from Origen, St. Jerome, as well as by the Hebrew manuscripts, shows that First and Second Samuel were originally one: ""Samuel."" This title was chosen not only because Samuel is the principal figure in the opening chapters also because he had been a determining factor in the history of the whole historic period comprised by the book.
Dividing the larger work into two smaller one was done when the Septuagint was compiled, this was done to make smaller scrolls, (that the Greeks had introduced), which were a more  convenient size.
The Book of Kings was divided at the same time, and the four books, being considered as a consecutive history of the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah, were named ""Books of the Kingdoms"" The vulgate retains the division into four books.
The Hebrew text of the Books of Samuel and of the Books of Kings was first divided in Bomberg's edition of the rabbinical Bible[1] (circa 1517), the individual books being distinguished as I Book of Samuel and II Book of Samuel, I Book of Kings and II Book of Kings. This nomenclature is found in the subsequent editions of the Hebrew Bible as well as the Authorized Version.
I-II Samuel comprise the history of Israel from the birth of Samuel to the close of David's public life;  covering a period of about a hundred years. The first book contains the history of Samuel and of the reign of Saul. (Saul's death marks the division between the two books.) II Samuel is the history of the reign of David.
If we look at First and Second Samuel together, as one book as they were originally, the contents are easily divided into five main sections:

1-7, history of Samuel
8-15 the history of Saul's government
16-31, Saul and David
II,1-20, history of the reign of David
21-24, epilogue and denouement. The division between 3 and 4 is sufficiently indicated by the death of Saul and by David's accession to power; the other sections are marked off by the summaries, 7:15-17; 14:47-58; 20:23-26

1 History of Samuel
The first chapter deals with Samuel's birth and consecration to the Lord.  The second chapter opens with Hannah's Song, then a telling of the misdeeds of the sons of Eli and prediction of the downfall of his house, 2:12-36. Chapter 3, Samuel's call to the prophetic office; his first vision, in which the impending punishment of the house of Eli is revealed to him. The army of Israel is defeated by the Philistines, Ophni and Phinees are slain and the ark taken, and the death of Eli occurs when hearing of the death of his wicked sons. The ark is among the Philistines, but it is brought back to Bethsames due to afflictions occurring to the Philistines.  The Ark is taken to Cariathiarim. Samuel as judge; he is instrumental in bringing the people back to the Lord and in inflicting a crushing defeat on the Philistines, 7:2-17.

2 History of Saul's Government
In Chapter 8 the people demand a king. Samuel reluctantly yields to their request. Saul, a strapping man, is looking for lost livestock and is privately anointed king by Samuel. Samuel gathers the people at Mizpah to elect a king; the lot falls on Saul, but he is not acknowledged by all. Saul defeats Naas, (the Ammonite king),  and opposition to him ceases. 
Chapter 12 is Samuel's swansong to the people. 13 brings war against the Philistines and Saul's disobedience to God's command for which Samuel announces his rejection. 
14: 1-46: Jonathan's exploit at Machmas; he is condemned to death for an involuntary breach of his father's orders, but is pardoned at the people's prayer. Verses 47-52 are the summary of Saul's wars; his family and chief commander.
Chapter 15 War against Amalec, a second disobedience and final rejection of Saul

Saul and David
In chapter 16 one finds that David, the youngest son of Jesse, is anointed king at Bethlehem by Samuel. He is called to court to play before Saul to sooth a savage spirit that comes over him and is made his armour-bearer. Then comes the story of David and Goliath. Jonathan's friendship for David is related just as  Saul's jealousy increases due to an evil spirit and his hearing the people singing songs lifting up David over him in battle.  Saul throws a spear at David, but misses. Jonathan quells his father for a time. Saul tries to have David marry into his family, but David refuses as he is of low birth.  Saul offers again with his younger daughter and sets a price in battle.  David agrees and is successful and marries Saul's daughter, Michol.  All the while Saul is hoping the Philistines will kill David, but instead David has triumph after triumph, renewing the enmity. Saul a second time attempts to kill David. Michol helps David to escape; he flees to Samuel at Ramatha. After Jonathan's effort at mediation fails, all hope of reconciliation is gone. David flees to Achis, King of Geth, stopping on the way at Nobe, where Achimelech gives him the loaves of proposition and the sword of Goliath. After being recognized at Geth he saves himself by feigning madness.

David as an Outlaw
David takes refuge in the cave of Adullam, and becomes the leader of a band of outlaws. He places his parents under the protection of the King of Moab. Saul kills Achimelech and the priests of Nobe (Chapter22). David delivers Ceila from the Philistines and avoids capture by Saul by fleeing to the desert of Ziph, there, he is visited by Jonathan. 

David's star rises while Saul's Falls
By chapter 23 David is delivered by Providence when surrounded by Saul's men. In 24 David spares Saul's life in a cave of the desert of Engaddi, as he will not kill God's anointed king. Samuel dies. The episode of Nabal and Abigail where Abigail saves the household after the foolishness of her husband.  He is stricken and Abigail becomes David's wife after her husband's death. During a new pursuit,in chapter 26, David enters Saul's camp at night and carries off his lance and cup. He becomes a vassal of Achis, from whom he receives Ziklag. He feigns raids in the territory of Judah and wars against the tribes of the south. 28 shows a new war with the Philistines and Saul's entreatment of the witch of Endor.
29 and 30 David accompanies the army of Achis, but is sent back when his loyalty was doubted by the Philistine chiefs. On his return he finds that Ziklag has been raided by the Amalecites and Abigail carried off with other prisoners. He pursues the marauders and recovers the prisoners and the booty. 31:The Battle of Gelboe against the Philistines causes the death of Saul and Jonathan.  Those seeking favor with David for saying they killed Saul are themselves slain for taking the life of God's anointed.


Author and date
I Samuel, up to chapter 24, is ascribed to this prophet the part referring to his time. Chapters 25 and following are attributed to the prophets Gad and Nathan as ascertained by the rabbinical tradition and most of the older Christian writers. This view is evidently based on I Chronicles 29:29: ""Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer..."" This wording of the text might lead one to conclude that there are three distinct works, with the works of Nathan and Gad not having survived to modern day and not being incorporated as part of the Bible.  The internal unity of the book excludes composite authorship.  Hummelauer suggests that there was a redactor who combined the works and that this redactor is the prophet Nathan. This view is doubtful though as the work can hardly be placed so early. Others attribute it to Isaiah, Jeremiah, or Ezekiel. None of these opinions rests on any solid ground therefore it is best to say that the author is unknown.
The date of composition is assigned by some (Hummelauer e.g.) it to the last days of David.   According to recent critics it belongs to the seventh century B.C., but received retouches as late as the fifth or even the fourth century B.C. No sufficient data are at hand to fix a precise date. We can, however, assign cedrtain limits of time within which the work must have been composed. The explanation concerning the dress of the king's daughters in David's time (II Sam 13:18) supposes that a considerable period had elapsed in the interval. It also points to a date later than Solomon, during whose reign a change in the style of dress was most likely introduced by his foreign wives. How much later is indicated by the remark of I Samuel 27:6: ""For which reason Ziklag belongeth to the kings of Judah unto this day."" The expression ""kings of Judah"" implies that at the time of writing the Kingdom of Israel had been divided, which occurred under Solomon's son, and that at least two or three kings had reigned over Judah alone. The earliest date cannot, therefore, be placed before the reign of Abiam. The latest date, on the other hand, must be prior to Josiahs' reforms (621 B.C.). 
The author repeatedly records without rebuke or comment, violations of the Pentateuchal law regarding sacrifices. Now it is not likely that he would have acted thus if he had written after these practices had been abolished and their unlawfulness impressed on the people, since at this time his readers would have taken scandal at the violation of the Law by such a person as Samuel, and at the toleration of unlawful rites by a king like David. The force of this reason will be seen if we consider how the author of I-II Kings, who wrote after Josias's reform, censures every departure from the Law in this respect or, as in 1 Kings 3:2, explains it:Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days.
The purity of language speaks for an early rather than a late date within the above limits.

It is recognized that the author of I-II Samuel made use of written documents in composing his work. One such document, ""The Book of the Jasher (Just),"" is mentioned in connection with David's lament over Saul and Jonathan (II Sam 1:18). The canticle of Hannah (I Sam 2:1-10), David's hymn of thanksgiving (II Sam 22:2-51; cf. Psalm 17), and his ""last words"" were very probably also drawn from a written source. But besides these minor sources, the writer must have had at hand, at least for the history of David, a document containing much of the historical matter which he narrates. This we infer from the passages common to I-II Kings and the First Book of Chronicles, which are shown in the following list:–
I Sam 31
II Sam 3:2-5
II Sam 5:1-10
II Sam 5:11-25
II Sam 6:1-11
II Sam 6:12-23

I Chronicles 10:1-12
I Chronicles 3:1-4
I Chronicles 11:1-9
I Chronicles 13:1-14
I Chronicles 14:1-16
I Chronicles 15:25-29
I Chronicles 16:1-3, 43
Although these passages often agree word for word, the differences are such that the author of I Chronicles, the later writer, cannot be said to have copied from I-II Samuel and it must concluded that both authors made use of the same document. This seems to have been an official record of important public events and of matters pertaining to the administration, such as was probably kept by the court ""recorder"" (2 Samuel 8:16; 20:24), and is very likely the same as the ""Chronicles of King David"" (1 Chronicles 27:24). To this document we may add three others mentioned in 1 Chronicles 29:29 as sources of information for the history of David, namely, the ""Book of Samuel,"" the ""Book of Gad,"" and the ""Book of Nathan."" These were works of the three Prophets, as we gather from 2 Chronicles 9:29; 12:15; 20:34, etc.
Samuel very probably furnished the matter for his own history and for part of Saul's; Gad, David's companion in exile, the details of that part of David's life, as well as of his early days as king; and Nathan, information concerning the latter part, or even the whole, of his reign. Thus between them they would have fairly covered the period.
Besides these four documents other sources may occasionally have been used. A comparison of the passages of I-II Sam and I Chronicles given in the list above shows further that both writers transferred their source to their own pages. Since one did not copy from the other, the agreement between them cannot be explained except on the supposition that they more or less reproduce the same (third) document. 

According to recent liberal critics, I-II Samuel is nothing but a compilation of different narratives so unskillfully combined that they may be separated with relative ease. In spite of this supposed ease in distinguishing the different elements, critics are not in agreement as to the number of sources, nor as to the source to which certain passages are to be ascribed - and therefore cast strong doubt on their claims.

"""Weird Al"" Yankovic",https://www.conservapedia.com/%22Weird_Al%22_Yankovic,"Alfred Matthew ""Weird Al"" Yankovic (born October 23, 1959) is an American comedian, parodist, satirist, musician, writer, actor, accordionist, and singer-songwriter. He has, for three decades, parodied popular songs by inserting his own (often silly) lyrics, or performing songs in the style of an artist or an entire genre. Since his first-aired song ""My Bologna"" in 1976, Yankovic has sold more than 12 million albums, recorded more than 150 parody and original songs, and has performed over a thousand concerts. He has earned three Grammy awards and had nine nominations, four gold records, and six platinum records.
Yankovic was born in Downey, California to Nick Louis Yankovic and Mary Elizabeth, and was raised in Lynwood.
In 2000, Yankovic had his first top ten album and single with Straight Outta Lynwood (10) and White and Nerdy (9) respectively.
Yankovic achieved his first number one album with his latest album Mandatory Fun in 2014 when it debuted at number 1.
Despite lingering rumors that Yankovic is Jewish, mainly due to his Eastern European surname, his face, and song ""Pretty Fly for a Rabbi,"" he is actually a devout Christian who belongs to the Churches of Christ.

Political views
""Weird Al"" Yankovic didn't have any understanding in politics, and as such demonstrates liberal positions in some respects, particularly with regard to his vegetarianism.[1] He also held that the conservative positions of his friend Victoria Jackson are so funny as his work in the movie UHF, starring both.[2] ""Weird Al"" Yankovic also advocates same-sex marriage[3][4] and ""gun control,""[5] and seems to be ""anti-war""[6] and perhaps even anti-business (he mocks those who have wealth, regardless of how hard they worked for it).[7] His keyboardist Ruben Valtierra classified the debate among Republican presidential candidates on Fox News as a ""comedy show"". Nevertheless, ""Weird Al"" Yankovic is seen by the most radical leftist sectors as a fascist conservative.[8] ""Weird Al"" Yankovic also criticized capitalism on the track ""Mission Statement"" from his latest album Mandatory Fun.

"""Signing statement""",https://www.conservapedia.com/%22Signing_statement%22,"A Signing statement is an official statement made by the President as he signs a bill into law that includes instructions to executive officials about how to interpret and put in place the new law. Such statements have been common since 1993.
While generating controversy they are seen by most experts as a legitimate tool of executive power because they are part and parcel of a given law's ""legislative history,"" in that they reflect the administration's interpretation of legislation and because theoretically they can serve as executive orders to subordinate officials.

Bush
Liberals vehemently opposed the extensive use of signing statements by President George W. Bush after he used them to assert that he could authorize officials to bypass provisions that he considered unconstitutional in bills banning torture and in the oversight provisions of the USA Patriot Act.  Candidate Barack Obama in 2008 denounced them as an abuse.

Obama
To the dismay of his liberal supporters, Obama has thus far issued five signing statements, claiming the authority to bypass dozens of provisions of bills enacted into law since he took office.
For example, Obama issued a statement signing a bill that funded the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank while requiring the administration to pressure the organizations to adopt certain policies. Obama's statement announced that he could disregard the negotiation instructions under his power to conduct foreign relations.  In response on July 9, 2009, the House issued a bipartisan rebuke, voting 429 to 2 to ban officials from using federal money to disobey the restrictions. 
Other laws Obama has said he need not fully obey include limits on whom he may appoint to a commission, and a restriction on putting American troops under United Nations command.

1986 Midterm Elections,https://www.conservapedia.com/1986_Midterm_Elections,"In the midterm elections of 1986, the Democratic Party gained five seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, and more significantly took back control of the U.S. Senate by gaining eight seats. Despite Democratic congressional victories, Republicans gained eight governorships, including Florida and Texas.
In the House, voters generally accepted the status quo, with just five Republicans and one Democrat defeated for reelection. A probable reason for Democratic gains in the Senate was that the Republican Senators who were elected in 1980, riding on Reagan's coattails, were up for reelection for the first time. In fact, six out of the seven Republican incumbents defeated were first-term Senators. 
The south seemed to be trending Republican following President Reagan's landslide reelection in 1984, however Democrats made strong gains, winning every southern Senate seat that was up for election that year. Future Republican Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert was election to Congress in Illinois. Future Republican presidential nominee John McCain was elected to the Senate in Arizona to replace the retiring Barry Goldwater, future Senate Majority Leaders Tom Daschle was elected to replace George McGovern in South Dakota and Harry Reid was elected in Nevada.

Advantages
Storage space is conserved
Network communication can be reduced
Disadvantages
In some cases, compression can be potentially harmful.  These include:

Flash memory wear: Flash Drives, Secure Digital (SD) cards, and solid-state drives can wear out more quickly due to the increased read/write operations required[1]
Increased file vulnerability: A single lost of corrupted bit can result in the entire file being destroyed
Increased drive vulnerability: If an entire drive is compressed (an option which Windows makes easy in its modern versions) then this problem can be magnified—a lost bit or two can cause the entire contents of the drive to be destroyed.
Additionally, compressing files (or file systems) requires more work from the computer's processor, so this tends to decrease the operating speed on the computer while it is accessing such files.

Common file extensions
When a file or group of files is compressed, it is stored in an archive file using a specific format, which will be marked as such by a file extension.  Common file extensions include:

The amendments which adorn the bill may provide special benefits to various groups or interests.[1]
An example is the National Defense Authorization Act; since the bill is a must-pass issue, as it provides for funding for Operation Iraqi Freedom, members of the Democratic party have tried to tag the bill with various other amendments supporting the homosexual agenda. Bills that would be politically dangerous for members of Congress to be on record as voting against are thus especially likely to become ""Christmas tree"" bills.

1971 Theological Controversy at Central Baptist Theological Seminary,https://www.conservapedia.com/1971_Theological_Controversy_at_Central_Baptist_Theological_Seminary,"In the early part of 1971, the hot waters of controversy began to boil at Central Baptist Theological Seminary in Kansas City, Kansas, where Paul T. Losh served as president.  Discussions among students and faculty at this school—associated with American Baptist Churches—surfaced that some students thought their professors were promoting liberal views in the classroom.[1]
In an open letter to the student paper, James Rozmus, a student himself, wrote of his desire for professors to teach according to the school's statement of faith and called for professors to resign if they did not agree with the statement of faith.[1]
In response, three professors—Alvin C. Porteous, M. Edward Clark, Warren Lane Molton—submitted their resignation letters.  The letters asked the board of directors to side with Rozmus or indicate that the school could be a place of diverse thought.  After consideration, the directors accepted their resignations.[2]
One newspaper quoted professor Porteous as saying, ""We are regretful of the fact the issue relative to our resignations has been subject to a good deal of misunderstanding….  It is not an issue as to whether the seminary be defined as liberal or conservative, but whether it is prepared to affirm diversity of theological stance within its faculty….""[2]
Central Baptist Theological Seminary is now in Shawnee, Kansas, and Molly Marshall is the president.   Marshall wrote of the 1971 controversy, ""It is an interesting window into an earlier day at Central.  I am always glad to learn more about the challenges and actions of my forebears at this venerable school.  It is amazing that God's providence has preserved it through many 'dangers, toils and snares.'""[3]

Democrats still retained a narrow 222-209 seat majority in the House and a 57-38 seat majority in the Senate.
During the mist of World War II, President Franklin Roosevelt called for ""an end to politics"" [1] as he switched leadership roles from a domestic policy President to a wartime President. However, the nation had yet to fully recover from the Great Depression, unemployment and inflation remained high. Disgruntlement over the attack of Pearl Harbor and conditions of wartime led to big Republican gains. Thomas Dewey won the governorship of New York and emerged as the Republican nominee for President in 1944 and 1948.

1946 Midterm Elections,https://www.conservapedia.com/1946_Midterm_Elections,"In the midterm elections of 1946 the Republican Party gained 55 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and 13 seats in the U.S. Senate, giving them a majority in both houses of Congress for the first time since 1930. Two notable freshmen included future U.S. Presidents John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon. 
President Harry Truman, who assumed the presidency upon the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt, had his approval ratings plummet to just 32%.[1] Truman's problems were ironically within his party coalition. Coal miners and railroad workers were going through a nationwide wave of strikes. Truman decided that the unions had gone too far, and had the government takeover the railroads. He announced that his administration would use the army as strikebreakers and deny seniority rights to strikers.[2] Truman lost the support of unions, which he desperately needed. He further alienated southern Democrats by calling for a Fair Employment Practices Commission (FEPC) to prevent job discrimination against African Americans.
After taking office, Truman wanted to build on the New Deal, announcing a full employment program, a higher minimum wage, a larger Social Security System, and a national health insurance system. The nation was divided over continued government intervention in the economy. High inflation and lack of consumer goods like bread, meat, and housing resulted in economic anxiety. Republicans blamed Truman for the country’s problems, and ran on the slogan ""Had Enough? Vote Republican.""
Republicans swept into power and put them in a position to thwart the Truman Administration's programs. Thomas Dewey was handedly reelected Governor of New York, and become the Republican nominee for President in 1948. Truman's reelection chances looked bleak. A public opinion poll taken in December 1946 revealed that only 35 percent of those surveyed supported his handling of the presidency. However, Truman pulled a major political upset, winning reelection by attacking the ""do nothing Republican Congress."" 
In reality, the 80th Congress was anything but a ""do-nothing Congress."" They left behind a strong legislative legacy, including passing the 22nd Amendment (limiting the president to two terms), putting restrictions on labor unions, passing a major tax cut, establishing the U.S. Air Force, the Department of Defense, the National Security Council, the Central Intelligence Agency; and approved the Marshall Plan and aid to Greece and Turkey, starting the policy of containment during the Cold War.
This was one of just two separate occasions that Republicans controlled Congress in a period from 1931 until 1995.

Democratic primaries
Hubert Humphrey accused George McGovern of violating campaign spending limits they had agreed upon. McGovern accused Richard Nixon of failing to ""wage an effective war on drugs and narcotics gangsters"" and suggested ""the Federal Communications Commission should intervene against television and radio commercials suggesting that certain drugs are the answer to emotional or behavioral problems.""[1]

Democratic nomination
The Democratic party was deeply split after their near-collapse in 1968 and in 1972 the leftwing faction won out, then self-destructed. The nominee after a nasty primary battle was South Dakota Senator George McGovern, and initially his running mate was Thomas Eagleton. Eagleton had a secret history of mental illness (complete with electric shock treatments to his brain) that was revealed after he accepted the nomination. Although McGovern said he was ""1000% behind Eagleton,"" the insanity issue threatened to destroy the credibility of McGovern's crusade and Eagleton was forced off the ticket. Numerous leading Democrats publicly rejected the VP nomination until finally a Daley-supporter and Kennedy in-law, Sargent Shriver, accepted. Polls showed Nixon winning a huge landslide, as indeed happened. 

General election
The McGovern camp counted on the vote of young people disaffected by the Vietnam War to boost their support as the voting age was dropped from 21 down to 18.  Their turnout stayed low.
Nixon ridiculed McGovern as the far left-candidate of ""acid, abortion and amnesty"" (""acid"" meant illegal drugs; abortion was now an issue; McGovern favored amnesty for draft dodgers.)  Instead Nixon promised that peace was at hand, and indeed peace was reached with the Vietnam war ending in January, 1973. It seemed as well that Nixon's détente policy was ending the Cold War.  Peace and prosperity against a confused opponent leading a bitterly divided Democratic party.
Nixon was running a nonpartisan campaign separate from the Republican Party in the hopes of winning over many Democrats and independents.  He was fearful that this new approach would be sabotaged by the Democrats, so he authorized ""dirty tricks"" to discover what the Democrats were planning. His operatives broke into the Democratic National Headquarters at the Watergate Hotel, and were caught. Nixon desperately tried to cover up the crime and divert suspicion away from him, and he was successful for a while. 
The voters overwhelmingly chose Nixon with the numerically highest popular vote margin in history (though Warren G. Harding won a slightly higher percentage margin in 1920).

100 days,https://www.conservapedia.com/100_days,"The first 100 days of the tenure of the President of the United States is considered a way to determine how much momentum the president has going in his direction.
Franklin D. Roosevelt was the first president to employ such a strategy when he took office in 1933, coining the term to refer to the first 100 days of the 73rd U.S. Congress.[1] The mainstream media often gives higher ratings to liberal presidents on their first 100 days than to conservative presidents, even if the latter accomplish more.[2] The mainstream media loved Barack Obama's first 100 days in office and overexaggerated his success in that time period.[3]
Despite the media's spin on his presidency,[4] President Donald Trump had a relatively successful first 100 days in office,[5][6][7] having signed the most pieces of legislation since Harry Truman and the most executive orders ever in that timeframe.[8]

 Jews at the Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement
The Yom Kippur War was fought between Israel, Egypt, and Syria.  The war commenced on October 6, 1973 when Egyptian mechanized divisions crossed the Suez Canal by using a series of pressurized water cannons to demolish sand walls on the opposite side of the canal, and then crossing on pontoon bridges.  This was concurrent to a Syrian advance into the Golan Heights.  The date was chosen because Yom Kippur is the holiest and most solemn day in Judaism, and many Israeli army were stood down during that time.  The delay in mobilization, and the lack of a preemptive strike against Egyptian and Syrian forces allowed the initial success of these advances.  However, the lack of commercial traffic (due to the solemnness of Yom Kippur) allowed Israeli forces to mobilize more quickly than usual.
At first, the Israeli counterattack was focussed primarily against the forces in the Golan Heights as these were much closer to Israel proper, whereas the Egyptian forces in the Sinai peninsula were not as immediate a threat.  Initial counterattacks against both armies were ineffective because the Israelis were hugely outnumbered in armor, although the Egyptians and Syrians were fielding obsolete Russian tanks as opposed to the more modern European and American tanks fielded by Israel.  To counter this advantage, the Arab armies armed their soldiers with Russian anti-tank weapons.  Additionally, both armies used fixed SAM emplacements, and avoided leaving the coverage of this air umbrella, thus blunting the offensive power of the Israeli air force.
Facing defeat, the Israelis implored the United States for military aid, as the Europeans refused to assist under threat of an Arab oil embargo.  The United States airlifted a large number of tanks and aircraft into Israel, thus replacing Israeli losses.  Because of the influx of materiel, the Israelis were able to commit their forces to a renewed offensive posture, overwhelming the older Egyptian and Syrian divisions.
Because the Israelis through the majority of their reserves into the Golan Heights theater, they were able to push back the Syrian advance, and counterattack into Syria, though this counterattack was ultimately turned back by a combined Syrian, Jordanian, and Iraqi force.  In the Sinai, after several attacks and counterattacks, both sides went into a defensive stance to hold the ground that they had.  On October 14, the Egyptian forces decided to attack first, but made a tactical blunder in attacking the Israelis head on and outside of their SAM umbrella.  The Egyptian tanks were decimated by the superior Israeli armor and air power.  The following day, the Israelis counterattacked across the Suez canal.
By October 23, the Israeli army, though pushed back from the outskirts of Damascus, still had captured additional territory near the Golan Heights, and was close to encircling the Egyptian army in the Sinai peninsula.  The United Nations chose this time to impose a cease fire which went into effect at sundown on the 23rd.  However, overnight the Israeli army continued its attack in Egyptian territory in order to complete the encirclement of the Egyptians.  In a conference with Golda Meir that evening, Henry Kissinger asked ""how can anyone ever know where a line is or was in the desert?""  Their army now encircled, the Egyptians had no choice but to accept the cease fire in exchange for the creation of UN checkpoints to allow non-military supplies to reach their army, and the exchange of prisoners of war.  Although the cease fire did not bind the Syrians, they decided not to further counterattack the Israeli army, though their combined force of Syrian, Iraqi, and Jordanian troops had the Israelis in a state of retreat.
Ultimately, the cease fire led to an armistice, and the Camp David accords wherein Egypt agreed to a lasting peace in exchange for the return of the Sinai peninsula, which the Egyptians had lost during the Six Day War, and the recovery of which had been the primary goal of the Yom Kippur War.  However, the airlifting of supplies by the United States to the Israelis directly precipitated the 1973 OPEC oil embargo.

Cause
The 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict was the result of the actions of the terrorist group Hezbollah who were staked out in southern Lebanon.  The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah began on July 12, 2006 when Hezbollah terrorists crossed the border into Israel and attacked an Israeli army convoy, killing eight soldiers and kidnapping two others.  Hezbollah had been looking to capture Israeli troops so they could trade them for hundreds of prisoners in Israel that had been rounded up in their occupation of Lebanon and Palestine.[1] Hezbollah embedded itself within a civilian population, housing its office buildings, military positions, and weapons caches among civilians. Hezbollah also fired its rockets from within civilian villages and cities making it extremely difficult if not impossible to distinguish between civilian and Hezbollah areas. Israel dropped leaflets and broadcast radio messages warning civilians to leave certain areas, often giving up the element of surprise. To prevent further supplies of arms from Syria and Iran reaching Hezbollah, Israel launched air attacks against Beirut’s airport and major land routes, while a naval blockade prevented shipping from entering or leaving the ports. Thousands of foreign nationals eventually were evacuated from the war zone. 
Unlike past wars, such as the 1956 war against Egypt or the 1967 war against Egypt, Syria and Jordan, the Israeli military did not immediately launch powerful ground assaults. Ground attacks did occur, largely from the second week onwards, but these were individual assaults to take or neutralize specific targets relatively close to the border. One significant commando assault did take place in the northeastern Lebanese city of Baalbeck, but that was designed as a specific attack to seize individual Hezbollah leaders. Only in the days leading up to the cease-fire did the Israeli military launch any significant assault, which took it to the Litani River in southern Lebanon.[2]
The fighting lasted for 34 days until a UN Security Council resolution achieved a ceasefire on August 14, 2006, and an agreement was reached for a “robust” version of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) to be installed in southern Lebanon to prevent Hezbollah from reestablishing itself there and using the area to attack Israel.[3]
Nearly 1,200 people in Lebanon, mainly civilians, and 157 Israelis, mostly soldiers, died during the war.

Media Coverage
The press coverage of the event in the West came under heavy criticism, as the liberal anti-Israel media intentionally gave favorable coverage to Hezbollah.[4]  Many instantly claimed Israel was responsible for casualties before investigations revealed that they were not.  The most famous incident of bad press coverage was the now fired Reuters journalist Adnan Hajj, who intentionally doctored his pictures of the events.[5]

Desecration
In January 2008, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, boasted that the terrorist group had gathered as trophies the body parts of Israeli soldiers left on southern Lebanon's battlefields during the war. Shi'ite Muslim followers cheered as he claimed ""I am not talking about regular body parts. I tell the Israelis, we have the heads of your soldiers, we have hands, we have legs... There is even a near-complete body, a half or three-quarters of a body, from head, to chest to the torso."" His speech demonstrated that the Hezbollah terrorist organization violates the values that are sacred to all religions, including Islam. 
Nasrallah's comments prompted Israeli ministers to call for his assassination.[6]

The Winograd Commission
The final report of the Winograd Commission into Israeli conduct of the war was released on January 30, 2008.  The report was critical of military and political authorities, stating that there was ""flawed performance by the military, especially the ground forces, and of deficient Israeli preparedness.  Israel did not use its military force well and effectively, despite the fact that it was a limited war initiated by Israel itself"".[1]

007,https://www.conservapedia.com/007,"James Bond (or 007) is a fictional British MI6 secret agent created by writer Ian Fleming. Beginning in 1952, Fleming wrote 12 James Bond novels and two collections of short stories until his death in 1964. Subsequent James Bond novels have been written by many writers, including Kingsley Amis.
James Bond is best known from the feature-length movies. ""Dr. No"" (1962) was the first of the James Bond film series produced by EON Productions, and an adaptation of Ian Fleming's sixth James Bond novel.  James Bond films have always been somewhat epic in scope, featuring exotic locations, fast cars, beautiful women and elaborate stunts.  Bond is also known for his heavy drinking and smoking, along with sexual encounters (Fleming himself indulged in much of this same activity, leading to his early death).  Although Bond has faced many adversaries, during the Cold War many of his opponents were from Soviet Russia (or in the case of Die Another Day, North Korea). The most recent Bond film was Spectre (2015).
The current James Bond is Daniel Craig, who has taken the role back towards the more rugged character that Connery and Dalton brought to the screen, as opposed to the portrayal by Pierce Brosnan.

"17th ""Pavia"" Infantry Division",https://www.conservapedia.com/17th_%22Pavia%22_Infantry_Division,"The 17th Pavia Infantry Division was a major combat formation of the Regio Esercito (Royal Italian Army) during the Second World War. It was formed in October 1939 and sent to Italian Libya in February 1941 for defensive operations during the final stages of Operation Compass. The Pavia saw extensive action in North Africa and was destroyed in the Second Battle of El Alamein. The bulk of the division comprised the 27th, 28th Infantry Regiments and 26th Artillery Regiment.

Battle of El Mechili
The Pavia Division took part in General Erwin Rommel's first desert offensive (nickhamed the Benghazi Derby among the retreating British Imperial troops) in late March and early April 1941. Under Major-General Pietro Zaglio, the Pavia attacked via the Balbia coastal road from Agedabia, helping the Ariete Armoured Division and 8th Bersaglieri Regiment force the Australian, British and Indian divisions to relinquish their gains and fall back to Tobruk. On 3 April, the 8th Bersaglieri Regiment with the help of reconnaissance troops from the Sabratha Division, recaptured Benghazi and advanced to El Mechili, along with the advance elements from the German 5th Light Division. On 8 April, General Gambier-Parry surrendered to General Zaglio and the Pavia after a breakout attempt was broken up by heavy fire from the Fabris and Montemurro Bersaglieri Battalions that had taken up ambush positions around the British fortress under the cover of darkness. Some 3,000 British, Indian and Australian soldiers were captured as a result of the actions of the Pavia and supporting Bersaglieri.[1][2]
With the arrival of the German Afrika Korps, the Pavia and Brescia Divisions help isolate and capture Bardia. The Italian divisions then take part in the Siege of Tobruk, taking up positions in the southern sector of the Axis siege lines.
In early May 1941, the Australians defending Tobruk counterattack in an attempt to recover several strong-points lost to the Italians from the Ariete and Brescia Divisions, but the Pavia, Trento and Ariete defeat the attacks.[3]

Operation Crusader
On 23 November 1941, the British 70th Infantry Division with 60 supporting tanks overruns part of the defenses of the 25th Bologna Infantry Division, but the Pavia counterattacks, restoring the broken lines.[4]
On 4 December, the Pavia and Trento recapture the British-held ‘Plonk and ‘Doc’ strong-points outside Tobruk.[5]
On 5 December, the Pavia Division from positions at El Adem  covers the German withdrawal from Tobruk, delaying the advance of the 1st Battalion from the Durham Light Infantry in chaotic night-fighting lasting over three hours.[6]
On 14 December, the Maoris from the New Zealand 22 Battalion encountered stiff resistance from the Pavia Division that counterattacked twice, before withdrawing. The New Zealanders with the help of strong artillery fire capture 382 soldiers from the Pavia in the action, but lose 3 killed and 27 wounded in the process.[7]
On 15 December, the Pavia, Brescia and Trento Divisions covering the German withdrawal from the Gazala Line, successfully resist the advance of the 2nd New Zealand Division and supporting Polish Brigade, allowing Italian and German armoured forces to join and deliver a strong counterattack that overruns the 1st Battalion, Royal East Kent Regiment (The Buffs).[8]

Operation Venezia
On 16 June 1942, the Pavia takes part in the mopping-up operations following the Battle of Knightsbridge, with 6,000 demoralized British Imperial troops falling into Italian hands.[9]

El Alamein
The division took part in the First Battle of El Alamein as part of the Italian 10th Corps. During the initial phase of the fighting the Pavia served as part of the rearguard for the Ariete Armoured Division where, according to US Army Colonel Conrad H. Lanza, the division repulsed the advance of the Maoris of the New Zealand 23rd Battalion with a night counterattack that overwhelmed the New Zealanders. Corporal Pasquale Franchi from the Pavia would posthumously win the Medaglia d'Argento al Valore Militare for his role in the counterattack.
On the night of 14/15 July 1942, the Pavia along with the Brescia Division put up a stubborn defence on Ruweisat Ridge, allowing Field Marshall Erwin Rommel to assemble German armoured and motorized infantry units to counterattack in support of the Italians, overrunning the attacking New Zealand infantry and supporting British armour in the morning action.[10][11] Captain Amalio Stagni and Corporal Ugo Vaia from the Pavia would each posthumously win the Medaglia d'Argento al Valore Militare for their leadership during the night action on Ruweisat.
During the Second Battle of El Alamein, one battalion from the Pavia Division fought alongside the Folgore Parachute Division. At the end of the battle, the Pavia along with the other two divisions from the Italian 10th Corps were abandoned without transport as the remnants of the Afrika Korps retreated from Alamein to Fuka and Mersa Matruh on 4 November 1942. At Mersa Matruh, where several of the survivors of the Pavia had regrouped (including its commander), the remnants of the division were soon trapped and forced to surrender.[12]

.223 Remington,https://www.conservapedia.com/.223_Remington,"The '.223 Remington caliber, and its military equivalent 5.56x45mm NATO, is a small, light low power round used primarily for military assault rifles like the M16 and M4, civilian personal defense weapons such as the AR-15, varmint hunting and medium game shooting.  It is the standard cartridge used in the AR-15 and many other semi-automatic rifles.

Ballistic Characteristics
The .223 has a wide range of bullet weights and designs, from the 40 gr. NT which has a muzzle velocity of 3500 fps. to the 77 gr. BTM which has a muzzle velocity of 2750 fps.  There is even a 90 gr. VLD (very low drag) bullet for this caliber.  The most common military ammunition loads are the M885 SS109 62 gr. FMJ with a penetrator and the older M193 55 gr. FMJ's.  Unfortunately these loads depend on different twist rates in the rifle barrel for optimal stabilization.  Older M16's used a 1:14"" twist rate which suffered in accuracy below freezing.  M16A1's, like most varmint hunting rifles, were switched to a 1:12"" twist rate which is optimal for light bullets such as the 55 gr. M193.  When the SS109 bullet was adopted a faster twist rate, 1:7"" twist rate was required to stabilize the longer 62 grain bullet with its penetrator at the base of the bullet.  Custom barrels also exist in twist rates of 1:10, 1:8, 1:6.5 and even 1.6 inches for use with the long heavy bullets.  Gun owners are advised to check the twist rate of their firearm and match up appropriate bullet loads for optimal performance out of their weapon.

Appeal for Home Security
The 223 Remington's appeal for home security is due primarily to its use in the civilian semi-automatic AR-15 personal defense rifle and in military fully automatic assault rifles such as the M16 and M4, which in turn is due to its lighter weight and subsequent increased carrying capacity per soldier.  With it long history of use by the United States Military, police and civilians; .223 ammunition supplies can be inexpensively acquired in large quantities.

Same-sex ""marriage"" (also called sodomite ""marriage"", homosexual ""marriage"" or ""gay marriage"") is a liberal attempt to advance the homosexual agenda and force the public to pay benefits for relationships that are not procreative and typically are not even monogamous. This is not only contrary to thousands of years of success based on a one-man/one-woman marriage system and in direct violation of the Bible[1] and most other religious teachings,[2] but also antisocietal as can be shown by scientific device of thought experiment used for investigation of nature of things.
On June 26, 2015, the United States Supreme Court, in a 5-4 ruling in the case of Obergefell v. Hodges, illegally claimed that same-sex ""marriage"" was ""legal"" in all 50 states, despite not having the power or authority to make such a ruling. As a result, local, state and federal laws (as well as state constitutional provisions) that distinguish between heterosexual marriage and same-sex ""marriage"" are claimed by same-sex ""marriage"" supporters to be  ""unconstitutional"" under the Fourteenth Amendment, even though, in fact, no such ""right"" to same-sex ""marriage"" exists in the Fourteenth Amendment or anywhere else in the Constitution. Contrary to the claims of many liberals, the decision advanced big government by making the definition of marriage a federal and constitutional issue, in addition to a government issue.
Same-sex ""marriage"" is legal in twenty-two countries: the Netherlands, Belgium, Brazil, Spain, Canada, South Africa, Norway, Sweden, Portugal, Iceland, Argentina, Denmark, Uruguay, Finland, Luxembourg, Ireland, New Zealand,[3] France, the United States, Germany[4] and the United Kingdom (excluding Northern Ireland) Additionally, in Mexico, same-sex ""marriage"" is legal in the states of Quintana Roo, Chihuahua, Guerrero and Coahuila, as well as in Mexico City, a federal district similar to Washington, D.C. Other countries, such as Colombia and Chile, recognize civil unions and domestic partnerships.[5][6]
In Norway and Sweden, the adoption of same-sex ""marriage"" has led to a loss in respect for the marriage institution itself even for traditional couples.  In Massachusetts, the legalization of same-sex ""marriage"" led to a decline in property values.[7] Also in response to the introduction of same-sex ""marriage"" the State Department of Public Health changed marriage certificates to read ""Party A"" and ""Party B"" instead of husband and wife.
In May 2012, voters in North Carolina banned both same-sex ""marriage"" and homosexual unions.  North Carolina thereby became the 29th state to pass an amendment against same-sex ""marriage"", by a huge 61-39% margin.[8] Barack Obama—heavily dependent on donations from homosexuals for his reelection—rushed to prop up the homosexual agenda by endorsing same-sex ""marriage"" after its stunning defeat in this swing state.
Some studies and polls about same-sex ""marriage"" conducted in a few countries generally claim support for same-sex ""marriage"" increases with higher levels of education, and that younger people are more likely to support the legalization of it than older generations due to propaganda campaigns targeting the younger generation.[9][10][11][12][13] Polls show the most religious people regardless of age are more likely to oppose it.[14] Prior to 2012, in each U.S. state to hold a voter referendum on the issue, the public rejected same-sex marriage laws by a small majority.[15] However, In 2012, Maine, Washington and Maryland voted in favor of same-sex marriage. In April 2013, Rhode Island became the tenth state to begin recognizing same-sex marriage.[16] Additionally, recent polls from liberal poll organizations claim to indicate that more than half of Americans ""support"" same-sex ""marriage"", approximately 53%.[17][18][19]
Campaigns advocating same-sex ""marriage"" were at the forefront of the homosexual rights movement's attempt to elevate homosexuality to the same moral plane as heterosexuality, overturning centuries of established tradition whereby homosexuals would keep their (according to many Christians) sinful acts hidden. Some opponents of same-sex ""marriage"" claim its purpose is to destroy the family as an institution, merely to secure a legal basis for sexual freedom. According to some opponents of same-sex ""marriage"", the primary purpose of marriage is to bring joy to society as much as to safeguard the development of happy families, and it is not for individual glory. They believe that unrelated people living together make each other miserable and harm society.  Among the many reasons homosexuals might advocate same-sex ""marriage"" are the ability to make emergent healthcare decisions for a loved one in the absence of a durable power of attorney or living will, the alteration of the laws of intestate succession to include homosexual partners, and the same tax treatment as heterosexual married couples.
Current United States law defines ""marriage"" as ""one man, one woman"" for purposes of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which prohibits the federal government from recognizing same-sex relationships as marriages for any purpose, even if permitted under state law, and permits a state to disregard a same-sex ""marriage"" entered into in another state. However, due to the liberal Supreme Court overturning section 3 of DOMA as ""unconstitutional"", the federal government currently recognizes homosexual ""marriages"" as equal to the traditional, correct marriage. An interesting consequence of the federal definition of ""marriage"" is that it specifically rules out polygamy.

Background
Public opinion about same-sex ""marriage"" has shifted rapidly.  In the United States, the period between 2012 and 2015 marked a rapid shift in the public debate on this issue.  While religious teachers continue to discuss this important topic, the matter has not received much public discussion since 2015.  Indeed, in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, it was not a major issue raised by the candidates. Of the responses in a May 2016 Gallop Poll, 61% favored same-sex ""marriage"" and 37% opposed it.[20]  Responses in a 2016 Pew Forum poll found that only 27% of white evangelical Protestants and 39% of black Protestants favor same-sex ""marriage"" while it is supported by a majority of other religious groups and 80% of the nonaffiliated category.[21]
In the United States, marriage is primarily governed by each individual state and marriage laws differ from state to state. Several states allow civil unions between two people of the same sex, and 37, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York, Maryland, Maine, Washington, Rhode Island, Iowa, California, Delaware, Minnesota, New Jersey, Hawaii, Illinois, Oregon, Idaho, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, Arizona, Kansas, Oklahoma, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Alaska and New Mexico, plus the District of Columbia, currently issue same-sex ""marriage"" licenses, although most of these states were illegally forced to do so by activist federal courts acting outside of their mandate. Only in Maine, Maryland, and Washington has same-sex ""marriage"" been approved by popular vote. Minnesota was the first state, in 2012, in which voters voted against a state constitutional amendment defining marriage as between one man and one woman. Same-sex ""marriages"" were legal in Alabama for one month in 2015 following a federal court decision, but were halted by the Alabama Supreme Court pending the June 2015 ruling of the United State Supreme Court on the matter. Same-sex ""marriages"" are recognized by the federal government since the overturning of section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, however, recognition varies between departments of the federal government, with some departments referring to the legality or non-legality of the ""marriage"" in which the ""couple"" resides, and others referring to the legality or non-legality of the ""marriage"" according to where the ""marriage"" took place. 
In 1996 Congress recognized the likelihood that liberal activists would soon seek changes to the laws in some states that pertain to homosexuals. It considered the possibility of test cases reaching the Supreme Court, and of the court conceivably ruling that a state—even though it prohibits same-sex ""marriage"" itself—must honor same-sex ""marriages"" performed in another state pursuant to the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution. The Defense of Marriage Act, which was passed and signed by President Clinton, prevents this possibility, and also prevents the Federal Government from recognizing marriage as anything other than a union between a man and a woman.  Its Constitutionality has not yet been tested under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, or the Due Process Clause of the 5th Amendment.
In 1999 a Vermont court ruled that under its constitution, it was not required to allow same-sex ""marriage"" but was required to make provisions to grant same-sex couples legal rights identical to those provided by marriage. Vermont responded by creating ""civil unions,"" which are legally distinct from marriages but convey the same rights. In 2009, the Vermont legislature overrode the governor's veto to pass a bill allowing same-sex ""marriage"".
In 2003 the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that under Massachusetts' constitution, same-sex couples could not be denied Massachusetts marriage licenses, making Massachusetts the first state to issue same-sex ""marriage"" licenses. As of April 2009, same-sex ""marriage"" was legal in four states, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont, and Iowa.[22][23]
Beginning in 2008, the states of Washington, and Oregon also provide for same-sex unions. Washington later legalized same-sex ""marriage"". Hawaii provides certain benefits to same sex couples.[24]  The State of New Hampshire issued civil unions until the summer of 2009, when it passed a bill approving same-sex ""marriage"" [25] The state began issuing same-sex ""marriage"" licenses in January, 2010.
In the fall of 2009, a same-sex ""marriage"" bill was introduced to the Washington, D.C. city council by At-Large Council Member David Catania (who is openly homosexual). After two days of testimony involving nearly 250 witnesses,[26] the council voted to approve the bill, 11-2. Once signed by the Mayor, the bill went to Congress for a mandatory 30-day review period. While opponents of the bill vowed to fight it in Congress[27] it passed and became law in 2010.
Five years after Hernandez v. Robles, a New York Court of Appeals case in which the court declined to legalize same-sex ""marriage"" in New York via judicial fiat, the New York legislature voted for same-sex ""marriage"" on June 24, 2011.[28]
Same-sex ""marriages"" were legal for a brief period in the state of California, but the people of that state voted to repeal the law in the fall of 2008,[29] through a ballot initiative known as Proposition 8. The legislature of Maine approved a same-sex ""marriage"" bill in May 2009 [30] but opponents lobbied to have the bill put up to a popular vote, and it was defeated by the voters in the fall of 2009.[31] Same-sex ""marriage"" eventually became legal again in California in 2013 after the United States Supreme Court declined to rule on the case after deciding that those defending it did not have standing to do so, after the gubernatorial administration of California and the attorney general of California had refused to defend the law.
In Israel, all marriages must be performed by a religious organization - there is no ""civil"" marriage. Specific religions may determine the definition of marriages that they perform, and none currently recognize same-sex couples. However, a Supreme Court decision determined that Israel must recognize all marriages performed outside the country, same-sex or opposite-sex. In September 2011, an Orthodox Jewish rabbi in Israel attempted to marry homosexual males to homosexual females so they could start a conventional family. However, the plan drew criticism both from liberals, who said the plan was meant to discourage homosexuality, and from conservatives, who argued the plan promoted loveless relationships.[32]
In the Netherlands overseas territories of Aruba, Curacao, and Sint Maarten, same-sex ""marriages"" are not performed, but all marriages performed in the mainland portion of the country (including same-sex) are recognized. In Brazil, same-sex civil unions can be converted to marriages by state judges on a case-by-case basis. Additionally, the state of Rhode Island recognizes, but does not perform, same-sex ""marriages."" Furthermore, California recognizes all same-sex ""marriages"" performed in or out of state before the passage of Proposition 8. 
Some opponents of same-sex ""marriage"" believe that the religious ceremony of marriage is governed by each denomination and is unaffected by laws passed by civil authority. Same-sex ""marriage"" is forbidden in Orthodox Judaism, Catholicism, and most mainstream Protestant denominations. In Conservative Judaism (no relation to the political philosophy known as ""conservatism""), synagogues and rabbis are allowed, but not required, to recognize and perform same-sex ""marriages"". Reform Judaism also allows rabbis to use ""good faith"" on this issue, but as the least-religious branch of Judaism, they take this stance on most issues. Additionally, homosexuality (and by extension same-sex ""marriage"") is forbidden in Islam. 
Many libertarians argue eliminating any legal definition of ""marriage"" and simply granting legal benefits to all couples under a neutral name would solve this problem and satisfy both sides. This is called ""marriage privatization"". Many religious conservatives still feel this is unacceptable - see that article for more details.
Public attitudes toward same-sex ""marriage"" parallels attitudes toward homosexuality.

Morality
Social conservatives regard same-sex ""marriage"" as immoral, and argue that use of the word ""marriage"" is a misnomer, because the marriage services of Christian denominations define marriage as the union of a man and a woman. Some social liberals try to use this debate as an excuse to take the socially-conservative view of marriage out of the law. In some Christian marriage ceremonies, the wedding will begin with a statement along the lines of: ""Dearly beloved: We have come together in the presence of God to witness and bless the joining together of this man and this woman in Holy Matrimony,""[33] a definition which was also written into United States federal law in 1996.[34]
Dr. James Dobson's Focus on the Family organization prefers the phrase same-sex ""marriage"" (which is also the phrasing preferred by Conservapedia), with quotation marks around the word ""marriage,"" to call attention to his belief that marriage—civil as well as religious—is intrinsically a union between a man and a woman, and that that same-sex unions are counterfeits.[35]
Use of the term ""same-sex 'marriage'"" was unheard of a few decades ago; however, these unions are now among a number of issues advocated by liberal activists. They argue that heterosexual people are allowed to marry and so the homosexual population should be given that right too.
Some advocates of same-sex ""marriage"" view marriage as a purely civil matter, which in the history of the United States is a position taken particularly strongly by Puritan colonists, who viewed the interjection of religion into the franchise of marriage as scandalous to Christ's Church.

Motivation for advocating it
 A recent study by the Canadian government states that ""violence was twice as common among homosexual couples compared with heterosexual couples"".[36]
James Dobson cites Stanley Kurtz to argue that the motivation of those advocating same-sex ""marriage"" is not to secure the benefits of marriage for homosexual couples, but to destroy the institution of marriage itself:

...most gays and lesbians do not want to marry each other. That would entangle them in all sorts of legal constraints. Who needs a lifetime commitment to one person? The intention here is to destroy marriage altogether. With marriage as we know it gone, everyone would enjoy all the legal benefits of marriage (custody rights, tax-free inheritance, joint ownership of property, health care and spousal citizenship, etc.,) without limiting the number of partners or their gender. Nor would ""couples"" be bound to each other in the eyes of the law. This is clearly where the movement is headed.[37]
Homosexuals are beginning to admit they want what Mollenkott proposes, namely the destruction of the concept of monogamy and traditional marriage altogether. What they really are after is a society that recognizes every sexual arrangement as normal - even group sexual liaisons and polygamy.[38]
In reality nobody is trying to stop homosexuals from doing what they want to do, or tell them they can't live together, or have a domestic partnership. The only reason many people oppose same-sex ""marriage"" is to prevent the definition of ""marriage"", more of a religious institution than a legal one, from changing, and to avoid being forced to have to recognize a union between two persons of the same gender as if it were equivalent to a marriage between a man and a woman.

Child-rearing and adoption
According to a March, 2007 report, there are 65,000 adopted children in the U.S. being raised by same-sex couples.  The same report says 14,100 foster children were being raised by one or more homosexual or lesbian foster parents.[39]
In Great Britain, the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) has expressed its full support to the stand taken by the Catholic Church opposing regulations on homosexual adoption. The Catholic Church sought to be exempt from the new law.  The  Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams of the Church of England, supports the Catholic Church's efforts declaring that the rights of conscience cannot be subject to laws. Catholic leaders have already said that its teachings prevent its agencies placing children with homosexuals and they will have to close if bound by the rules.  The MCB, the UK's leading Muslim umbrella group embracing over 400 affiliated organizations, said that while it supported anti-discrimination laws, homosexuality is forbidden in Islam.[40]
Several states, including New York, allow any two adults living together to adopt a child regardless of marital status or sex. This law provided a method for same-sex couples to adopt children even before New York legalized same-sex ""marriage"".

Homosexual promiscuity
See also: Homosexuality and promiscuity
Studies indicate that homosexual couples have higher rates of promiscuity than heterosexual couples.[41]  Allowing homosexuals to ""marry"" would make them seek more partners.[42]

Homosexual violence and abuse
In addition, studies report that homosexual couples have significantly higher incidences of violent behavior. These studies are not surprising given what pathologists have stated regarding the commonness and brutality of homosexual murders[Citation Needed] (see Homosexuality and Murders).  The prevalence of violence and emotional abuse in same-sex domestic partnerships. One survey found 53% of homosexuals felt if the high incidence of violence against partners in homosexual relationships was known and understood by the heterosexual population, it would hinder the drive for homosexual rights.
Domestic abuse is divided into two categories, emotional abuse and physical abuse.  While homosexual domestic abuse has not been studied to the extent that heterosexual relationships have, preliminary studies indicate a much higher level of abuse.

Family breakdown
Bishop Harry Jackson has shown how same-sex ""marriage"" is causally linked to the breakdown of the family in recent decades, particularly the black family.[43]  As noted in the 1965 Moynihan Report,[44] the breakdown of the African-American family is a national concern.  He has attributed support for same-sex ""marriage"" in the District of Columbia and Maryland to a demonic force called the Queen of Heaven.[45]
Subsequent to same-sex ""marriage"" becoming law in Massachusetts, property values declined and many left the State, in contrast to those states that do not recognize it.[Citation Needed]
One study published in liberal magazine Time, however, claims that the children of same-sex couples or homosexual parents have equal or higher scores in psychological evaluations as well as cognitive. Researchers Nanette Gartrell, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California at San Francisco, and Henry Bos, a behavioral scientist at the University of Amsterdam, led a study focused on planned lesbian families in which a lesbian couple had chosen to adopt children or undergo artificial insemination to start a family. The study claims that these children were shown to have higher self esteems and confidence which in turn enabled them to have higher test results academically than their straight-parent counterparts.[46]
Same sex union stability has been studied in Norway and Sweden using registered partnerships. 
Although in these countries patterns in divorce risks are rather similar in same-sex and opposite-sex marriages, marriages and that unions of lesbians are considerably less stable, or more dynamic, than unions of homosexual men. Divorce risk for female partnerships is practically double that for male partnerships. The authors argued a higher propensity for divorce in same-sex couples is perhaps not surprising given this group's lower exposure to normative pressure to maintain lifelong unions. 
[47]

Social dysfunction
Legalization of same-sex ""marriage"" is correlated with social dysfunctions[48] that states and countries banning it have avoided.  States and countries legalizing same-sex ""marriage"" have markedly different levels of quality of life from those that have banned it. For example, 8 of the 10 states with the highest median income have legalized same-sex ""marriage"" (Maryland, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Hawaii, Delaware, and California).

Collapse of civilizations
Some ancient civilizations that recognized same-sex ""marriage"" collapsed, while some that refused to recognize it escaped that fate.[49] However, Correlation is not causation, and there is not even a large enough data set to get a correlation.

Legal disadvantages for heterosexuals
Legalization of same-sex ""marriage"" would confer special rights on homosexuals, thereby placing heterosexuals at a legal disadvantage.[50]
The fact that the strongest predictor of support for same-sex ""marriage"" is level of education[51] shows that brainwashing into professor values has a corrosive effect on morality.
According to Bill Borst, a regular substitute radio host for conservative Phyllis Schlafly on WSIV, rights are a zero-sum game.[52] If this is true, granting same-sex couples the right to ""marry"" will necessarily come at the expense of the rights of others.

11th Amendment,https://www.conservapedia.com/11th_Amendment,"The judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another state, or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.
Ratified 1795.


This Amendment was proposed and ratified in swift response to an unpopular decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, Chisolm v. Georgia, 2 U.S. 419 (1793).

Analysis
The scope of the Eleventh Amendment has been explained by the Second Circuit:



 “

 The immunity recognized by the Eleventh Amendment extends beyond the states themselves to ""state agents and state instrumentalities"" that are, effectively, arms of a state. Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Doe, 519 U.S. 425, 429, 117 S. Ct. 900, 137 L. Ed. 2d 55 (1997); see also McGinty v. New York, 251 F.3d 84, 95 (2d Cir. 2001). It does not, however, extend to ""suits prosecuted against a municipal corporation or other governmental entity which is not an arm of the State."" Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. at 756; see also Board of Trustees v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 369, 121 S. Ct. 955, 148 L. Ed. 2d 866 (2001). Thus, as this court has explained, a governmental entity is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity only if ""it is more like 'an arm of the State,' such as a state agency, than like 'a municipal corporation or other political subdivision.'"" Mancuso v. New York State Thruway Auth., 86 F.3d at 292 (quoting Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 280, 97 S. Ct. 568, 50 L. Ed. 2d 471 (1977)).

How many athletes will do the equivalent of Tebowing after a victory?  American Meb Keflezighi, who won the silver medal in the marathon in 2004, typically gives glory to God with the sign of the Cross after finishing a race.[3]

Missy Franklin, who won three gold medals at the 2012 games, thanked God as one of her first comments after winning.
Lauren Cheney and at least four other members of the women's soccer team are devout Christians who participate in Bible studies and worshiped together in church services.[4]
American Allyson Felix, whose three gold medals (200m, 4 × 100 m and 4 × 400 m relay) were the most by a female track star in nearly 25 years, has said ""I feel so blessed that God has given me the talent of running. My running is an amazing gift from God, and I want to use it to the best of my ability to glorify Him. For me, my faith is the reason I run. ... My goal is to be more Christ-like every single day, and that is not an easy task.""[5]
The first American medalist (silver) in the 10k since 1964, Galen Rupp, reportedly has a strong Catholic faith and attended Catholic high school.Dawn Harper, gold medalist in 2008 and silver medalist in 2012 in the 100m hurdles, said ""My faith was definitely a part of me growing up. ... I knew that God was real in my life.""[4]
The first gold medalist for Ireland since 1996, boxer Katie Taylor said after winning: ""I serve an amazing God and without Him I wouldn't be here without this gold medal around my neck."" Her boxing robe contained the verse, ""The Lord is my shepherd and my shield.""[6]
After winning the all-around women's gymnastic title, Gabby Douglas tweeted, ""Let all that I am praise the LORD; may I never forget the good things he does for me.""
Bernard Lagat, a medalist at prior Olympics, did the Sign of the Cross just before he was introduced to the crowd for the 5k race.  He then ""finished fourth after being clipped from behind in the final 200 meters,"" but showed tremendous sportsmanship, praised the winner, and gave thanks afterward as ""the most blessed person during my career.""[7] Indeed, at least three out of the eight athletes running in the 5k finals did the Sign of the Cross shortly before being introduced for the race, and a fourth runner is known to be a devout Catholic.
Ethiopian Tiki Gelana remarkably overcame a mid-race fall to win the women's marathon, after thinking ""thank God"" at the beginning of the race for the rain because she grew up running in rainy weather - but the lamestream media reported her quote with a small ""g"" for ""God"".[8]
Double-amputee runner Oscar Pistorius noted that he thanks God ""Because He is the reason for my success and the one that takes me from strength to strength.""[6]
The winner of both the 10,000 and 5,000 metres races, Mohamed Farah, bowed towards Mecca to give thanks to Allah after both his victories.

Will almost no athletes from public school sports programs win any gold medals, despite how public schools spend more than $500 billion annually to teach and train Americans?

The lamestream media state that Missy Franklin, the star swimmer, is a high school student, but fail to mention that she attends Catholic school rather than public school.

How many athletes will be unfairly expelled based on liberal censorship of their free speech?

One athlete—Greek triple-jumper Voula Papachristou—was expelled from the Greek National team by her own country's Olympic committee before it officially opened based on a one-sentence joke about immigration, even though she apologized. The joke in question was this from her Twitter: ""With so many Africans in Greece, the West Nile mosquitoes will be getting home food!!!"" It should be noted that Papachristou apologized for the tweet.
In addition to the Greek Olympic Committee's decision on Papachristou, the IOC's own twitter-use policy has been criticized for hindering free speech. The policy, which is claimed to protect the IOC's commercial rights, goes as far as to prevent athletes from ""reporting on events"". According to The Globe and Mail, even a tweet such as ""Won our games against China, USA. Next up, the Brazilians,"" could get an athlete expelled from the Games without notice. As of yet, no athletes have been expelled by the IOC for this social media censorship policy. 
Lolo Jones, a pro-abstinence American hurdler, is being criticized by the lamestream media for sending out a pro-Second Amendment tweet.
The liberal thought police expelled a Swiss soccer player for tweeting that South Koreans are ""retards.""[11]



Opening Ceremonies

Will Overrated Sports Star David Beckham be selected to light the Olympic cauldron?

Beckham was not selected as the final torchbearer. He was, however, a passenger on the speedboat that carried the torch up the River Thames. He assisted in the hand-off of the torch to Sir Steve Redgrave, one of Britain's greatest Olympians. Sebastian Coe, chairman of London 2012, stated, ""He [Beckham] will be more than an ambassador given what he has done, the commitment he has given and the amount of time he has spent with us in London on this project. He was not only alongside us when we won [the right to host the Olympics], he was alongside us when we threw our hats in the ring.""[12]

will atheist nations underachieve in team sports?

Yes.  The performance by Great Britain's teams was abysmal.  They were eliminated in the quarterfinals in soccer, the national sport.  They did not even make the tournament round in men's basketball, after going 1-5 in the qualifying matches.  In men's volleyball, Great Britain's team lost every single match and was eliminated.
Increasingly atheistic Australia underachieved in team sports also.  It failed to qualify for men's or women's soccer. In men's soccer, they finished last in their four-team qualifying group, competing against three mediocre teams: United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, and Iraq (Australia competes in soccer competitions against Asian teams, not Oceanic teams, unlike in most other team sports). The women did slightly better in qualifying, finishing third behind Japan and North Korea, but also failed to qualify. This is the first Olympics since 1976 where the Australian men did not compete - however the competition, while still weak, is much tougher than the competition in the Oceanic Zone they faced until 2004. Still, Australia was the best team in their men's qualifying group and should not have finished last. 
In women's basketball, France won Group B with a 5-0 record, while Australia finished 4-1 in the same group. Great Britain is 0-5. France and Australia won their quarterfinals. France will face Russia in the semifinals while Australia will face the United States.
In women's handball, Great Britain finished 0-5-0 and France is 4-0-1 (W-L-D). France lost to Montenegro the quarterfinals. Handball is almost unknown in GB, with only a dozen or so clubs, in stark contrast to most other countries in Western Europe.
In basketball, Australia finished 3-2, fourth in their group, and lost to the USA in the quarterfinals. France finished 4-1 and will face Spain in the quarterfinals. Basketball is a minor sport in GB, much less played than in continental Europe, and GB would have considered themselves lucky if they had won a match.
In men's volleyball, Australia finished 2-3 and was eliminated in the group stage.



Multiple

Similarly, will atheist nations underachieve in general?

China, an officially atheist and communist country, led in gold medals in the first week but then dropped badly to a distant second place behind the United States, despite China having more than three times the population of the United States and despite having a national program designed to produce champion athletes.  Increasingly atheistic Australia performed much worse than expectations.  Australia won 35 medals, but only 7 gold medals. France has 34 medals, of which 11 are gold. In 2008, Australia won 46 medals and France won 41. Australia won 14 golds that year, a total that they failed to surpass. ""Atheistic"" Great Britain, on the other hand, had its best Olympic showing since the 1908 Olympic Games (where Team GB had over half of the athletes in competition), although this is possibly because they were the hosts (as they were in 1908 and 1948). Even excluding Britain (which may or may not be accurate), the data is inconclusive as there is a 1/4 chance (25%) that two randomly selected countries would underperform by pure chance. 2016 will provide additional data to analyze, and it may be possible to reach a conclusion. Furthermore, any analysis including Great Britain in these Games is problematic, because hosts typically experience about a 30% medal boost.


wrestling

have feminist Title IX quotas destroyed the U.S. team?

The U.S. men's wrestling team won only three medals - less than half that won by much-smaller and less prosperous Iran, and only a fraction of the medals won by Russian, despite the U.S. winning far more medals overall than both nations.
Men's track has also been ravaged by feminist Title IX quotas, and Team USA won only one bronze medal out of 12 medals in the marquee events of the men's 100m, 200m, 400m, and 800m events—which the U.S. previously dominated.
A majority of medals won by Team USA were won by women, but many of those were in sports unhelped by Title IX, such as women's gymnastics, swimming, tennis, and beach volleyball.



men's basketball

will selfless play by outspoken Christian Kevin Durant overcome ball-hogging by Overrated Sports Stars Kobe Bryant and LeBron James on USA Basketball?

Outspoken Christian Kevin Durant set an all-time Olympic record of 147 points, including a game-high of 30 points in the tight final game, while the media-promoted players did not do as well.


women's soccer

ranked #1 and won the gold in the last two Olympics, most recently with a foreign coach. Now that this U.S. team is politically correct, will it underachieve?[13]  Major rivals will be Japan, Brazil and France.

The U.S. women's team advanced to the finals only because of a foul that is almost never called in a big game: holding the ball too long by the Canadian goalie.[14]  In the finals the women's team then won the gold by a margin of only one goal against an underfunded team from Japan that had to fly to the Olympics in economy class.


Joke sports

Will underperforming countries pad their medal totals by excelling in many varieties of swimming and in non-serious sports like badminton and dressage?

Several nations were able to obscure their underachievement in real sports and pad their medal totals by winning joke sport events of dubious value, such as table tennis (atheistic China won all 4 gold medals),[15] swimming relays (there is no baton passed in a swimming relay), equestrian (Great Britain racked up five medals in this), [add more], synchronized swimming (China won two of the six medals awarded), and synchronized diving (where China won all four gold medals).


men's tennis

will one of the Greatest Conservative Sports Stars—such as Novak Djokovic—win the gold medal? Will Andy Murray of atheistic Britain underperform?

Both players advanced to the semifinals, where Murray defeated Djokovic in straight sets. Murray defeated Roger Federer of Switzerland for the gold in straight sets, while Djokovic underperformed and lost to Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina in the bronze medal match.  Murray then went on to play in mixed doubles match that same day and medalled silver with Laura Robson, losing to the heavily favoured Mirnyi and Azarenka.


8-month pregnant athlete

Will the lamestream media report on Nur Suryani Mohamed Taibi of Malaysia, who is competing while being 8 months pregnant, or does that send too pro-life of a message?

Taibi was eliminated from the Olympics on the first day of official competition after finishing in 34th place. Few articles mentioned her prior to her elimination; there was more publicity about her after her defeat.[16][17][18][19] The New York Times ran an article on the athlete on 16 July 2012,[20] The Guardian [21] and ESPN [22] both reported on her results in the competition.


Gun events

Will the lamestream media downplay the gun events because they want to continue to push gun control?

Great Britain shooter Peter Wilson's gold medal success in the double-trap clay pigeon event was widely reported and celebrated in the British media, despite Britain being strong in favor of gun control. The victory of Chinese air rifle shooter Yi Siling in winning the first gold medal of the games was reported in most GB media.[23] Coverage is similar to other sports with modest national following. See the entry above on the Malaysian shooter for an exception to this lack of coverage.


Openly homosexual athletes

Will the liberal media overpromote homosexual athletes, far beyond their achievements?

Several months before the games, Sports Illustrated ran a feature article entitled ""The Transgender Athlete"", which included significant overage of a transgender female-to-male shotputter attempting to qualify for the United States women's Olympic team. However, she failed to qualify at the US Olympic Trials, and as such did not receive any coverage during the actual Olympics.

Will countries that have implemented same-sex marriage underperform? (See below for a more lengthy explanation)

The total number of medals decreased:[24]
 Belgium - 5 in 2000, 3 in 2012
 Canada - 14 in 2004/2008,[25] 18 in 2012
 Denmark - 7 in 2008, 9 in 2012
 Netherlands - 25 in 2000, 20 in 2012
 Norway - 6 in 2004, 4 in 2012
 Spain - 19 in 2004, 17 in 2012
 Total - 76 expected, 71 actual - decline by more than 6%[26]


Men's Handball

Will underdogs Tunisia overperform in Group A? Group A should perhaps be dubbed the ""Group of Left"", as the other five teams are Sweden, Iceland, and Argentina, where same-sex marriage is legal, and increasingly atheistic Great Britain and France.

Tunisia went 2-3 in the group stage, becoming the second African team ever to advance to the quarterfinals. They then lost to Croatia, the winner of Group B in the quarter finals.
It should be noted that they finished 8th ranked in the twelve team tournament, beating the Great Britain squad that was only formed for the Olympics and then disbanded, and the Argentine team, who qualified for the first time in 2012. So their performance could be viewed as living up to their expectations in some quarters.



2012 Olympics - Sports performance: Religious faith vs. atheism
See also: Sports performance: Religious faith vs. atheism 
The Sports Journal is a monthly refereed journal published by the United States Sports Academy. 
A journal article appeared in the Sports Journal entitled Strength of Religious Faith of Athletes and Nonathletes at Two NCAA Division III Institutions. The article was submitted by Nathan T. Bell, Scott R. Johnson, and Jeffrey C. Petersen from Ball State University.[27]
An excerpt from the abstract of the journal article Strength of Religious Faith of Athletes and Nonathletes at Two NCAA Division III Institutions declares:



 “

 Numerous studies report athletes to be more religious than nonathletes (Fischer, 1997; Storch, Kolsky, Silvestri, & Storch, 2001; Storch et al., 2004). According to Storch, Kolsky, Silvestri, and Storch (2001), four reasons may explain why religion interacts with athletic performance. First, athletes may identify with religious beliefs for direction and humility. Second, athletes may turn to religion to gain a sense of optimism and security, benefiting from such beliefs following a disappointing athletic performance. Third, religion can be used for emotional and psychological support in stressful circumstances like the uncertainty of athletic competition, which can cause athletes an overwhelming amount of anxiety. Religious beliefs can offer the internal strength to persevere through the stress. Fourth, religion “provides a cognitive framework conducive to the relief of anxiety associated with competition” (Storch et al., 2001, p. 347). This framework allows relief from fear and anxiety on the basis of the athlete’s understanding (i.e., belief) that a supreme being is in complete control of the situation. For example, athletes may rely on religious faith to place a poor athletic performance in perspective...
Religion can be an important aspect in athletes’ lives and may serve a protective function against psychological distress and maladaptive behaviors such as substance use or aggression (Storch, Roberti, Bravata, & Storch, 2004). Viewers of sporting events can frequently observe athletes pointing to the sky, engaging in team prayer on the court or field, and glorifying God following athletic competitions.[27]


 ”


This distinction became apparent as a number of Christian athletes have thanked God for their 2012 Olympic medals (see above). No Olympic athlete at the 2012 Olympic games has credited atheism with providing them enhanced sport performance.

Underachievement by nations allowing same sex marriage will be particularly evident.[29]

Nations that are increasingly atheistic
Sweden 1G, 4S, 3B - 1 per 890,806 (per capita)
Norway 2G, 1S, 1B - 1 per 1,298,980
Finland 0G, 2S, 1B - 1 per 5,482,013
Denmark 2G, 4S, 3B - 1 per 374,400
Netherlands 6G, 6S, 8B - 1 per 895,395
Britain 29G, 17S, 19B - 1 per 972,212
France 11G, 11S, 12B - 1 per 1,590,675
Australia 8G, 15S, 12B - 1 per 820,040
[30]

New Zealand 6G, 2S, 5B - 1 per 255,316
Canada 1G, 6S, 11B - 1 per 1,629,626
USA 46G, 28S, 29B - 1 per 2,656,353
The USA won the highest number of medals demonstrating that belief in sport is linked to faith.
Underachievement by atheistic nations will be particularly evident in the team sports, where spiritual motivation is usually non-existent.  Expect the atheistic nations to underachieve most notably in soccer, where teamwork is paramount. Strongly Christian Mexico and Brazil won Gold and Silver in the mens soccer finals whilst the United States, Spain and Russia won Gold, Silver and Bronze respectively in the Basketball demosntrating the how a belief and shared faith can make teams perform to the highest standards.
Also, since Great Britain is the host nation, it may receive a boost in performance in spite of its increasingly atheistic nature. One should be careful to account for this when comparing Britain's performance this year to that in previous Olympic Games. The real reason Britain performed so well in 2008, 2012 amd 2017 was due to the huge liberal money that was poured into the sports agenda to bring Britain prestige even as it declines economically and moves into a dark era with atheism growing and faith declining.

Expected Medals
Many factors contribute to a country's success in the Olympics (e.g., population, proximity to host country, culture), and Gross Domestic Product cannot be used as a fair proxy, due to low (per capita) GDP China comfortably coming first in the 2008 Olympics and Russia ranking third. Below is how the Olympic medals would be awarded if each country earned medals in proportion to their GDP, which vastly overestimates the United States' performance.

Commemoration
The 2012 games mark the 40th anniversary of 11 Israeli Olympic team members taken hostage and killed by Palestinian terrorist group Black September. The Internal Olympic Committee has been urged to offer a commemorative moment of silence for the athletes at the opening ceremony. The IOC has rejected the moment of silence or any mention of the tragic event so as not to upset Muslim countries.[31] Sportscaster Bob Costas says NBC will honor the Munich 11 despite IOC’s refusal to allow it.[32]
There were reports in the media that NBC had cut out a portion of the opening ceremony memorializing the London subway bombing victims. However, according to ceremony director Danny Boyle, the portion was intended as a tribute to his late father, who would have celebrated his birthday that day had he still been alive. Although pictures of victims were displayed, it was not intended to commemorate the victims specifically.[33]

NBC Coverage
Scorn for Comcast's NBC coverage of the Olympic games hit America coast to coast. Viewers took to the internet with the trend #NBCfail During the event. The groans began at the opening ceremony when American viewers were denied the tribute to British victims of Islamic terrorism. However, Sports Illustrated later reported that ceremony director Danny Boyle had intended the tribute in memory of his father, whose birthday would have been that night, and that it was not specifically for the 7/7 victims. While pictures of some of the victims were displayed on the video board, in Boyle's mind, it had ""nothing to do with 7/7"".[33]
As the games moved forward, live events were interrupted or had already finished, replaced with commercials and NBC commentators talking about the athletes. It has been reported the Comcast spent $1 billion for the rights to televise the 2012 Olympics.

↑ Although part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Aruba competes separately at the Olympic Games. Same-sex marriage is not legal in Aruba, although marriages performed in the European mainland Netherlands are recognized per the Kingdom's requirements. Additionally, the territories of Curacao and Sint Maarten, who competed as ""Independent Olympic Athletes"" under the Olympic Flag following the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles and the loss of recognition of their Olympic Committee, have the same regulations as Aruba with regards to same-sex marriage. Since citizens of these territories are also Dutch citizens, they are also eligible to compete for Team Netherlands. Therefore, they may have won some of the Dutch medals. In all three territories, the population is heavily Catholic and there is large opposition to same-sex marriage in spite of the Kingdom's requirements. When Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba opted to integrate fully with the Netherlands as part of the dissolution, the Dutch House of Representatives passed a law that will make same sex-marriage legal in those territories effective in October 2012. However, this law was very strongly opposed by locals and should not be seen as a reflection of popular opinion. Athletes from those three territories were permitted to compete as Independent Olympic Athletes as well. However, of the four IOAs at the Olympics, three are from Curacao and one is a marathoner from South Sudan, which does not yet have a national Olympic Committee. Neither Aruba nor the Independent Olympic Athletes won any medals.

↑ In the United States, 6 out of 50 states permit same-sex marriage (Washington, D.C. also permits same-sex marriage), and 8 additional states permit civil unions.  Two states (including Washington, which had previously recognized civil unions) have declared same-sex marriage legal, but implementation is postponed until after voter referendums on the laws in November 2012. Additionally, in Mexico, same-sex marriage is legal in Mexico City, a federal district roughly equivalent to Washington, DC, as well as in the state of Quintana Roo.

2003 Barack Obama deal with Emil Jones,https://www.conservapedia.com/2003_Barack_Obama_deal_with_Emil_Jones,"When Illinois' U.S. Senator Peter Fitzgerald announced he would be retiring in April 2003, Obama jumped at the opportunity, declaring that he would be a candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2004.[1] To boost his chances at reaching the U.S. Congress in the 2004 elections, in 2003 Barack Obama approached the newly crowned head of the Illinois Senate, Emil Jones Jr., with a proposal. According to Jones, who Obama has since called his ""godfather""[2] the conversation went as follows:



 “

 ""After I was elected president, in 2003, he came to see me, a couple months later. And he said to me, he said, ‘You’re the senate president now, and with that, you have a lot of pow-er.’  And I told Barack, ‘You think I got a lot of pow-er now?,’ and he said, ‘Yeah, you got a lot of pow-er.’ And I said, ‘What kind of pow-er do I have?’ He said, ‘You have the pow-er to make a United States sen-a-tor!’  I said to Barack, I said, ‘That sounds good!’ I said, ‘I haven’t even thought of that.’ I said, ‘Do you have someone in mind you think I could make?,’ and he said, ‘Yeah. Me.’ ""[3][4]

 ”

 Because of the deal, Obama's entire Illinois Senate legislative record was, as longtime Obama reporter Todd Spivak put it, built in a single year. During his 7th and final year in the Illinois Senate, Obama sponsored an incredible 26 bills into law, including many he now points to when criticized as inexperienced[5] - as CNN's Suzanne Malveaux observed, ""With help from on high, Obama got his name on hundreds of bills that he pushed through.""[6] Jones not only had Obama craft legislation addressing daily tragedies to raise his political profile,[2] he also appointed Obama head of almost all high-profile legislation in the Illinois Senate, angering other state legislators with more seniority who'd spent years supporting the bills.[5] Illinois State Senator Rickey Hendon, the original sponsor of the famous racial profiling bill requiring videotaped confessions in police interrogations, complained bitterly about Jones' decision.


 “

 ""I took all the beatings and insults and endured all the racist comments over the years from nasty Republican committee chairmen. Barack didn't have to endure any of it, yet, in the end, he got all the credit. I don't consider it bill jacking, but no one wants to carry the ball 99 yards all the way to the one-yard line, and then give it to the halfback who gets all the credit and the stats in the record book.""
-Rickey Hendon[7]


 ”

 Hendon admitted he ultimately released the bills because of Jones' newly acquired power, saying, ""President Jones has considerable influence and a lot of power. I knew the President would like me a whole lot more if I went along with his wishes.""[7] Hendon also has made sure to remind Obama of how much was due to Jones, stating, ""He owes it all. He owes everything to President Jones. I never let Barack forget that. And we shouldn't let Barack forget that.""[6] Jones' influence had a major impact on Obama's chances in the 2004 elections, preventing major political players from backing Obama's opponents. To quote Emil Jones,


 “

 ""He knew if he had me in the run for the Senate, it would put a block on the current mayor. The current mayor and the father of the controller, which was Dan Hynes, they were roommates in Springfield when the mayor was a state senator, so they had a relationship. Another big financial backer for the governor was Blair Hull. Barack knew if he had me it would checkmate the governor, ’cause the governor couldn’t come out and go with Blair Hull, ’cause the governor needs me. Same with the mayor. So he had analyzed and figured all of that out. He knew I could help him with labor support. And I could put a checkmate on some of the local politicians that didn’t know him, but they couldn’t really go against me.""
-Emil Jones[3]

1

And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.






2

And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city.






3

And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so, dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.






4

And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they were subdued.






5

And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff was like a weaver's beam.






6

And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand, and six on each foot: and he also was the son of the giant.






7

But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's brother slew him.






8

These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.

1

And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.






2

And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know it.






3

And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord's servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?






4

Nevertheless, the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.






5

And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.






6

But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king's word was abominable to Joab.






7

And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.






8

And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.






9

And the LORD spake unto Gad, David's seer, saying,






10

Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.






11

So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Choose thee






12

Either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.






13

And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; for very great are his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man.






14

So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.






15

And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.






16

And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.






17

And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued.






18

Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.






19

And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the LORD.






20

And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.






21

And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.






22

Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD: thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people.






23

And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.






24

And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.






25

So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.






26

And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.






27

And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.






28

At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.






29

For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that season in the high place at Gibeon.






30

But David could not go before it to inquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.

1

Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.






2

And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God.






3

And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight;






4

Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.






5

And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be builded for the LORD must be exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore now make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death.

Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build a house for the LORD God of Israel.






7

And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build a house unto the name of the LORD my God:






8

But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build a house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.






9

Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.






10

He shall build a house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.






11

Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee.






12

Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD thy God.






13

Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.






14

Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.






15

Moreover, there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work.






16

Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the LORD be with thee.






17

David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,






18

Is not the LORD your God with you? and hath he not given you rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD, and before his people.






19

Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD.

1

So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.






2

And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.






3

Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.






4

Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers and judges:






5

Moreover, four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise therewith.






6

And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.






7

Of the Gershonites were, Laadan, and Shimei.






8

The sons of Laadan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three.






9

The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan.






10

And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.






11

And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to their father's house.






12

The sons of Kohath; Amram, Ishar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.






13

The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name for ever.






14

Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi.






15

The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer.






16

Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.






17

And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.






18

Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief.






19

Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.






20

Of the sons of Uzziel; Michah the first, and Jesiah the second.






21

The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish.






22

And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them.






23

The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.






24

These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward.






25

For David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever:






26

And also unto the Levites; they shall no more carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof.






27

For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above:






28

Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God;






29

Both for the shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is baked in the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size;






30

And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at even;






31

And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order commanded unto them, continually before the LORD:






32

And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the LORD.

Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.






2

But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Elezar and Ithamar executed the priest's office.






3

And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their service.






4

And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and thus were they divided. Among the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their fathers.






5

Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the house of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.






6

And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and before the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.






7

Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,

The one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to Gamul,






18

The three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to Maaziah.






19

These were the orderings of them in their service to come into the house of the LORD, according to their manner, under Aaron their father, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him.






20

And the rest of the sons of Levi were these: Of the sons of Amram; Shubael: of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah.






21

Concerning Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, the first was Isshiah.






22

Of the Izharites; Shelomoth: of the sons of Shelomoth; Jahath.






23

And the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.






24

Of the sons of Uzziel; Michah: of the sons of Michah; Shamir.






25

The brother of Michah was Isshiah: of the sons of Isshiah; Zechariah.






26

The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi: the sons of Jaaziah; Beno.






27

The sons of Merari by Jaaziah; Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri.






28

Of Mahli came Eleazar, who had no sons.






29

Concerning Kish: the son of Kish was Jerahmeel.






30

The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers.






31

These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger brethren.

3

But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build a house for my name, because thou hast been a man of war, and hast shed blood.

Howbeit the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath chosen Judah to be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over all Israel:






5

And of all my sons, (for the LORD hath given me many sons,) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.






6

And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.






7

Moreover, I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day.






8

Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God: that ye may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever.






9

And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the LORD searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.






10

Take heed now; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build a house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.

And by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread, for every table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver:

Also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and for the golden basons he gave gold by weight for every bason; and likewise silver by weight for every bason of silver:

And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD.

All this, said David, the LORD made me understand in writing by his hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern.

And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD God, even my God, will be with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD.






21

And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of God: and there shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing skilful man, for any manner of service: also the princes and all the people will be wholly at thy commandment.

Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation: and David said, Blessed be thou, LORD God of Israel our father, for ever and ever.






11

Thine, O LORD, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all.






12

Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.






13

Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.






14

But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.






15

For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding.






16

O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee a house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is all thine own.






17

I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.






18

O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee:






19

And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for the which I have made provision.






20

And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king.






21

And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel:






22

And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him unto the LORD to be the chief governor, and Zadok to be priest.






23

Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.






24

And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.






25

And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.






26

Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.






27

And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.






28

And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.






29

Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,






30

With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.

Differences between 2008 and other elections
In 2008, CNN-YouTube held the first debate in which the questions asked of the nominees in each party came primarily from YouTube viewer submitted videos. The debates received high ratings, however, CNN was criticized for not picking questions that were 'tough' or pertinent enough. One such example was during the Democratic Debate, when CNN chose to ask a question from a snow man, talking about global warming. During the Republican debate, some claimed that many of the questions were from Democratic supporters just meant to embarrass the Republican candidates. For example, a question over whether or not homosexuals should serve in the U.S. military was asked by retired general and gay activist Keith Kerr, an adviser to Hillary Clinton's campaign. 
The internet has also played a major role in the election, with then-Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul and Democratic candidate Barack Obama being very active on the internet.

Young voters
In 2004, 64% of voters aged 18–29 were registered to vote.  This year 75% of voters in that age group are registered.  This demographic usually favors Democrats.

Fewer Uncommitted
Fewer people were undecided this election than in most previous elections.  As of the beginning of October, 2008 approximately 6-8% of poll respondents were undecided, an amount that continued to decline as the election drew closer.

Election Day
The turnout was about normal, except for higher than usual rates among blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and voters under 30—all Obama groups.  The turnout of evangelicals and whites was similar to 2004. There have been allegations of Democrats driving voters around to different voting stations, and as these are Obama groups, this would strengthen the voter turnout of this demographic.

McCain vs. Obama
McCain had the early edge, wrapping up the Republican nomination before Obama was known to be the choice of the Democrats, but this was one of the few advantages he has had.  Both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama raised far more money than McCain, and the Democratic primary saw a surge of new voters coming out leading to a large increase in the rolls of Democrats.  From the historical position of a generally equal number of Republicans and Democrats, the numbers have now tilted 41% Democrat to only 32% Republican.  From the time that Obama was declared the nominee, opinion polling showed him with a modest advantage over McCain in terms of who the voters would choose to be their next President.
Obama's strategy was to tie McCain to George Bush, a very unpopular President, even though McCain was not a part of the Bush administration and often clashed with Bush during his time as senator.  McCain, for his part, had to walk a fine line with accepting praise from the President to woo conservatives, while at the same time keeping enough distance so as to not alienate moderates.  When possible, McCain went after Obama's lack of foreign policy experience.
The trends heavily favored the Democrats, especially after their major gains in 2006.  Overall, Democrat candidates have a +10% advantage over Republicans in a 'generic' election - the current unpopular President is a Republican, and the economy is treading water.  Also, based on statistical percentages of articles on each candidate, Obama was being focused on by the press far more than McCain.  When McCain chastised Obama for his lack of foreign policy experience and that he hadn't been to Iraq or Afghanistan in years, Obama's campaign set up for him to take a trip to both countries.  While this is expected in politics, the decision of every major network to send a team of reporters to follow him was unprecedented.  Obama spoke to 200,000 people in Berlin in a highly covered speech.  McCain spoke to 50,000 in Buffalo shortly thereafter and barely got a whisper.  Obama's numbers started to rise, but a good deal of the populace was noticing the disparity as 48% of those polled felt the press was trying to help Obama win.
Obama seemed pleased to coast on his advantages, but McCain realized he needed to shake things up.  He scored by pushing offshore drilling for oil during a time when oil prices were climbing almost daily.  Obama rejected the idea, but the poll numbers started to show a greater percentage of Americans warming to the concept[2] and McCain's numbers started to improve.  Obama announced he would accept some measure of offshore drilling, and McCain's momentum was halted and his gains retreated by a couple of points.  McCain started an ad campaign that acknowledged Obama's celebrity status, but asking what it meant.  A few days later at the start of August he called out Obama for 'playing the race card' when Obama made a reference to McCain and Bush trying to scare people because he (Obama) doesn't look like other Presidents on dollar bills.  The Democrats fired back, but quickly let the issue drop when poll numbers showed that most voters did consider Obama's statement to be racist.[3]  The bounce for Obama after the Berlin speech shrank back to pre-trip levels.  While Obama continued to enjoy a slight lead in the polls, McCain continued to keep the race close without either candidate breaking away. 
In mid-August, both candidates came together at the invitation of Pastor Rick Warren where each was asked a series of the same questions dealing both with political and personal views.  While not a debate, it was the first televised forum where both candidates had a chance to express themselves and their positions.  Obama hoped to appeal to Christian conservatives by expressing a religious side while McCain hoped to solidify the conservative base by sharing his own conservative and religious credentials.  The difference in style between the two was evident as Obama spent more time explaining and expounding on his positions while McCain was more straightforward and received more laughs with his candid speaking style.  The polling numbers continued as they had been.
There was a bounce at the start of the Democratic convention, but not what was expected as McCain suddenly drew even in the race.  The friction between Hillary Clinton and Obama as well as the perceived slight of Hillary when Biden was chosen as the Vice Presidential candidate hurt Obama at a time when his approval was expected to climb.  McCain then made a mistake by airing an ad of Hillary Clinton that 'supported' him.  Clinton was set to speak at the convention and it was no secret that there was bad blood between her and Obama and it was widely believed that her support for Obama would be lukewarm at best.  Instead, apparently galvanized by McCain's hubris before her speech, she came out strongly for Obama and rallied those who supported her.  Obama's pre-convention edge returned.  Obama followed it up with a very strong speech the next day in a huge stadium with fireworks and a Greek temple.  Dick Morris, a former Bill Clinton political strategist who gave advice to the Republicans in 2008, felt that Obama had done such a good job reaching out to the groups that he needed that he would pull ahead by double-digits.  In order to suppress the bounce from the convention, McCain announced his Vice Presidential candidate the next day, a woman, Alaskan governor Sarah Palin.  The bounce for Obama was muted at first, but increased in the following days to surpass pre-convention levels, especially as Sarah Palin came under heavy attack in the media.
The edge continued as the Republican convention began.  Losing a day to the hurricane, their shortened convention came out strong as well, emphasizing John McCain as a patriot and a maverick for change who is tested and will do what is right for the country regardless of political affiliation.  It was notable for the secondary role that the sitting President played, talking only briefly and barely being mentioned after that.  The convention tied McCain to Ronald Reagan, a popular Republican President who was able to gain the support of a good number of conservative Democrats, an ability that McCain would badly need to emulate.  While the convention had very high ratings starting with Palin's well received speech, it was unclear what the impact would be in the polls.  Indeed, Obama continued to lead directly afterward, but that soon changed with a turn of about 8 points and a slim lead for McCain.  The Republican convention had actually more than balanced out the powerful Democratic convention.
While Obama had stated that his campaign would avoid negative advertising, as it became clear that the bounce from the convention was continuing to last and he might lose the election, his campaign turned more forcefully to negative advertising.  In ads aired since the Republican convention through mid September, McCain's ads were about Obama 56% of the time, but Obama's ads were about his opponents 77% of the time.[4]  Obama also received a large boost from the press which vigorously attacked McCain, but even more so Palin.  Obama appeared on The O'Reilly Factor and was treated with civility and respect, even if not with agreement.  McCain and his wife appeared on The View and were treated to openly antagonistic attacks.  The constant negative barrage and reporting slowly moved the numbers back to even.
As the negative articles on Palin continued to intensify, some of which just quoted celebrities who had never met her calling her ""whacko"" or a ""hater of women"", her first major interview with Gibson was a turning point.  Gibson asked Palin about the Bush Doctrine, but wouldn't define it for her even as she asked questions for clarifications.  When she then answered with her understanding, Gibson rebuked her by implying that she misunderstood the doctrine.  In truth, since the term is only a press invention, it has taken on different meanings at different times and the definition that Palin gave matched one that Gibson himself had used years earlier.  Nevertheless, it was a moment and was jumped on by the press.  Those who saw the interview voted heavily that they were now less likely to vote for Palin.  The attack on her had muted her effectiveness, even if it was unjustified.
Stemming the tide of the McCain campaign's lead became a strong swing for Obama with a series of events that went to the Democratic nominee's favor.  The polls began to tack to Obama's favor with the collapse of Lehman Brothers and a subsequent 500-point drop in the Dow Jones Index.  Then, President Bush sounded a major alarm on the economy and proposed a huge 700 billion dollar rescue plan for the mortgage industry, which sent shock waves through the American populace and swept them with even more fear on the economic picture.  Bush called both Presidential nominees to meet with him and Congress.  It gave Obama a boost in legitimacy, his previous Achilles' heel.  While he had a weak record in accomplishments and showing leadership, the chance to be propelled to a position of prominence handed it to him on a silver platter.  Moreover, the plan was more problematic among Republicans than it was among Democrats, giving Obama another boost merely by supporting it while putting McCain on more shaky ground.  Both candidates supported it once again blurring McCain's advantage in experience if both men were seen as interchangeable in their reaction.
McCain chose to suspend his campaign until a deal on the rescue package was reached, a mistake.  The Democrats could add pork to the plan and make it even more unpalatable to the Republicans, and they did.  As the first debate loomed and no deal had been reached, McCain was in a quandary.  He chose to attend the debate under the view that the plan was well under way to being passed.  After the debate the plan was actually defeated and wouldn't be adopted, with more changes, until the following week.
McCain's debate with Obama went well and he was viewed as having done better than expected.  Unfortunately for him, Obama was also viewed as doing better than expected and was seen as looking Presidential, further cementing his standing and locking in a lead in the polls that had become rather substantial.  The Vice Presidential debate was the most watched in history and Palin was given high marks for her performance, but unfortunately for the Republican ticket, Biden was also on his game that night and also came across well.  There were no changes in the polling numbers and the number of undecided voters began to quickly dwindle.  The second and third debates caused little change as well.
With Obama spending 110 million dollars on TV advertising in October alone, including 30 minute specials on each of the major networks, McCain was hard pressed to make up the necessary ground to win the election after being outspent by 3 to 1 for TV adds over that time period.  He couldn't count on regular TV to help put in a good word for him either, as late night political jokes are running at a pace of 7 jokes against McCain/Palin for every 1 joke against Obama/Biden and a study of news stories on McCain and Obama since the end of the conventions found that 57% of news stories about McCain were negative while only 29% were for Obama.[5]  A later study by the independent Pew Research Center found that the discrepancy had grown even worse.  McCain had 57% of the articles about him negative while only 14% were positive, while Obama had more positive articles than negative.  The only network to achieve a balance, 40% negative for both, was Fox News.[6]

General Strategy
McCain's team emphasized to convince the electorate of the long-term leadership and experience that John McCain has shown in two decades of government service while emphasizing the relative untested nature of Barack Obama.
Obama's team stressed that Obama is the candidate of fresh ideas while downplaying his relative inexperience compared to the more seasoned McCain.  When possible, McCain is lumped together with George Bush, an unpopular President.

Republican Strategy
With more limited funding than his Democratic rival, McCain had favored open town hall meetings to attract the greatest number of people.  He is focusing his advertising on swing states.  He also asked for open debates with Obama of the Lincoln-Douglas variety where candidates can talk directly to each other, but this was not accepted by the Democratic camp which prefers the current structured format.
McCain will highlight his record of leadership, his service to his country and stress that as President he can be counted on to keep America safe from outside threats.  McCain's strongest supporters are the elderly - the group that most wants stability.
McCain's choice of Sarah Palin as his Vice Presidential nominee was a departure from what was expected and helped to show that he would go down paths that the Republican party had not done in the past.  McCain has touted Palin's record of standing up to the Alaska Republican party when she resigned from an Ethics Commission in protest over a lack of ethics of fellow commissioners, as well as when she ran against, and beat, then-incumbent Governor Frank Murkowski in the Republican primary in 2006.  McCain will continue to tout her as a ""maverick"" to complement his own maverick image that he is trying to emphasize. Last, by choosing a female running mate, McCain hoped to pick up the votes of female voters disaffected with the perceived slight of Hillary Clinton by Obama.  Prior to the start of the Democratic convention, 30% of Hillary's supporters had still not backed Obama and there was a good deal of bad blood between the two.
With the unfolding of the campaign season and watching the Democratic strategy and how it was playing out in the press and polls, the McCain campaign decided not to cede the moniker of change to Obama, but rather to take it upon themselves by emphasizing that McCain has a track record of change - while Obama does not.  The McCain campaign feels it needs to have the voters ask who can be trusted more to get the job done, and if that occurs, then they have the advantage.
With the selection of Palin, and the energy it has brought to the conservative base, McCain has taken to larger rallies, as opposed to town hall meetings and press conferences.  By mid-September, he had gone four weeks without a town hall, and three weeks without a press conference, instead sticking to larger engagements, appearing alongside his vice presidential nominee, with larger crowds than he had experienced earlier in his campaign.

Democratic Strategy
Democrats are confident that the low popularity of President Bush and particularly Operation Iraqi Freedom, which John McCain supports, puts them in a highly favorable position for 2008.  They have been cautious in the Iraq arena realizing that 'The Surge' worked and they were on the wrong end of that issue.  Focus is being put on a timeline for troops coming home, a position that most of the American population favors.
Democrats believe it is their race to lose, but also realize they had a good chance to win the last two Presidential elections and came up short each time.  General wisdom also states that a poor economy favors Obama, so they will emphasize the dire times in this area.  As in past elections, differences between those who have obtained a high income level and those who have not will be emphasized. In fact, the Democratic strategy in many ways mirrors that of their strategy in 1992 when the Democrat-controlled Congress deliberately caused economic disruption, knowing full well that the public would blame sitting president George H.W. Bush, and thereby allowing Bill Clinton to win that year's presidential race.
Favored by the young, Democrats will try hard to encourage and get out the young vote, a task that has proven more difficult than expected in the last two election cycles.  To their advantage, Obama made his vice presidential pick via text message to cell phone numbers registered on the site.  The announcement went to 3 million cell phones, a useful database for ""Get Out The Vote"" (GOTV) efforts, when voters may not be home or reachable on their landline.
As an extension of the DNC's strategy in the 2006 elections, led by Howard Dean, Barack Obama has been working towards a ""50-state strategy.""  The campaign is working to place campaign offices throughout the country with a focus on voter registration.  The increase in the rolls of Democratic voters from the primary battle between Hillary Clinton and Obama played out well for the Democrats and puts pressure on Senator McCain even in typically red states, and more specifically, ""Lean Republican"" states, to use the Cook Political Report's term.  In addition, with a fundraising advantage, Obama is airing ads in those tight states forcing McCain to make decisions about whether to use funds to match ads and campaign efforts in those states or rely on historical results that those states will support him and focus funds in traditional toss-up states instead.

Fundraising
Barack Obama had a significant edge over Hillary Clinton in the fundraising department during their contest for the Democratic nomination, but both actually set records for raising money and both raised far more money than John McCain.  McCain didn't have to spend as much since he locked up the Republican nomination much earlier than Obama locked up the Democratic.  Both Obama and McCain said they would accept government funds—which would also cap how much the candidates could raise on their own—but Obama, who could presumably raise more through his own sources, changed his mind and later declined.  Much of McCain's war chest will come from the Republican Party in general, which has more money to spend than their Democratic counterparts.  McCain's campaign raised $47 million in August, a very sizable figure for him so far and a personal record, but not as strong as Obama's best months. In the same time period, Obama set a record with $66 million. Obama, still having an edge in fundraising that has continued throughout his run for the Presidency, saw $10 million collected the day after Sarah Palin's strongly received convention speech, a new one day record.[7]  The Palin announcement has been good for John McCain's fundraising as well.
Obama set a new record of $150 million raised in September and over $600 million overall.[8]  Obama's camp does not release information on who contributes to the campaign.


Conventions
Democratic National Convention
For a more detailed treatment, see 2008 Democratic National Convention.
The 2008 Democratic National Convention was held in Denver, Colorado, from August 25 to August 27 at Pepsi Center. There, Senator Obama and his running mate were selected to be the party nominee's. Barack Obama will accepted the party's nomination in front of a crowd of more than 75,000 in a free, open event held at INVESCO Field at Mile High, in a platform resemblant to a Greek temple. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is the Permanent Chair of the Convention.
The convention had a rocky start as friction between supporters of Obama and the Clintons was not resolved.  Instead of Obama getting a bump in the polls, his support actually declined.  The Democrats also seemed to be at odds on finding a unifying strategy for how hard to attack John McCain and how to present it.  As Democratic pundit James Carville said in an interview on CNN, ""If this party has a message, it's done a <heck> of a job hiding it tonight, I promise you that.""[9]
A bleak convention was turned around by the Clintons. Infighting between Obama and Hillary continued through the day of her speech, but a comprise was reached, and, beyond expectations, she gave a rousing speech for Obama - possibly as an angry response to McCain's latest ad that showed her 'supporting' him. Bill Clinton the next night also praised Obama, something that he failed to effectively do in 2000 for Al Gore when he centered on his accomplishments and gave little more than lip service to Gore with statements amounting to 'and Al Gore was there too'. The convention, possibly remembering that, gave him the topic he was to speak on instead of choosing his own. Clinton was angered, but it worked. He came through. By the time Obama spoke on the last night, the theme that was missing at first was clear, and Obama mixed a message of attacking McCain with the need for change and even outlining some expensive programs that would appeal to the target populace who has been lukewarm to him. From a political point of view, the convention did what it was supposed to.


Republican National Convention
For a more detailed treatment, see 2008 Republican National Convention.
The 2008 Republican National Convention was held in Saint Paul, Minnesota from September 1 (Labor Day) until September 4. The presumptive nominee was Senator McCain. The location has political significance in that Minnesota will likely be a close state during the general election, as will its neighboring states Wisconsin and Iowa.
The convention schedule had to be altered due to the upcoming landfall of Hurricane Gustav. The first day almost entirely focused on raising money for Hurricane relief.  This led to a shortened three day convention instead of four and there was some shuffling of who was speaking on which day to accommodate the suddenly shortened time span.  In a surprise, George W. Bush was only delivered an eight-minute speech by satellite.  In another surprise Sarah Palin's speech was watched by as many people as saw Obama give his acceptance speech on the closing night of the Democratic convention, as over 40 million people tuned in.[10]  She was considered the highlight of the convention, even surpassing John McCain's speech the next day, and was noted for doing an exceptional job.  Recognizing the strong asset that they have in her, the Republicans made reference to her many times on the last day of the convention.  McCain, not known for being comfortable reading prepared speeches in a convention hall, delivered a solid speech.  While Obama continued to enjoy a lead in the polls, it changed quickly thereafter to a slight McCain-Palin edge.  The Republican convention more than canceled out a very powerful Democratic convention.

Leftist violence
 Poster circulated by community organizers. Other posters depicted rock throwers with the caption, ""Shut Down the RNC!,"" dead elephants, and derogatory and demeaning comments about gay Republicans. [2]
Progressives for Obama shares a huge membership overlap with the Movement for a Democratic Society (MDS), a group of former Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) members and sympathisers. MDS re-founded SDS in 2006 for a new generation of college students and functions as a support group for SDS's 130 college chapters. Independent researcher Trevor Louden refers to MDS as ""the brains behind the SDS brawn.""  The reconstituted SDS was very prominent in the violence at the Republican National Convention at St Paul.[11] The founder of ACORN, Wade Rathke, denouncd[12] an FBI informer who foiled a terrorist plot to kill delegates at the Republican Convention.[13]

Vice Presidential Candidates
Democratic Vice-Presidential Candidate
On August 23, Senator Barack Obama announced, via text message to 3 million cell phone numbers of his supporters, his nomination of Joseph Biden to Vice President.  Biden's selection was considered to be a prudent move by Obama, filling a hole in his own foreign policy experience that McCain could exploit.  With the implosion of John Edwards, Biden was widely expected to be the choice.  In order to help build up suspense, Biden said he was not chosen when he spoke to the press the day before, only to be shown as the Vice Presidential candidate the next day.  A long-term senator and Washington insider with over two decades of service in the Senate, his earlier 1988 plagiarism scandal and frequent gaffes (including one in which he insulted Obama in a racist manner during the 2008 election) were deemed to be less negative than the positive that his strong experience credentials could bring to the race.

Republican Vice-Presidential Candidate

Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska was announced as John McCain's choice early on Friday, August 29, the day after the Democratic convention ended.  A surprise choice not even considered by the press to be on McCain's short list, her selection caught the political world off guard.  It had been expected that Mitt Romney would earn the honor, but McCain had other ideas.  At first denigrated by the people in the Obama campaign, Obama's own statement was one of cautious neutrality to feel out what impact her selection would have on the race.


In an interesting twist, the selection of the Vice Presidential candidates changed the dynamics of the race.  By Obama picking Biden, he helped to fill the hole that McCain had been attacking dealing with a lack of foreign policy experience.  McCain's strongest point, experience, would lose some of its luster.  But the selection of Biden, and the passing over of Hillary Clinton, left another opening.  By aligning himself with someone who has been a Democratic stalwart, Obama's claim to change became less pronounced.  McCain seized upon that to select a Vice President that no one expected, and a woman, and steal some of the Democratic thunder.  Her lack of foreign policy experience would cut into the experience angle that had been in play earlier, but her own maverick streak in becoming governor by ousting another Republican, combined with John McCain's maverick choice in selecting her led to a new emphasis on McCain's own maverick past. Palin arguably had more ""executive"" / managerial experience than either McCain, Biden or, notably, Obama.  Suddenly he saw an opportunity to steal the moniker of change that Obama had been wearing, and he went for it.  Such a change in position occurring from the Vice Presidential selection is rare in Presidential politics.

Debates
Presidential Debates
For a more detailed treatment, see 2008 Presidential Debates.
There have been three presidential debates for the 2008 election season.  The first debate on September 26 discussed ""Foreign Policy & National Security"" and also dealt at length with the economic crisis. The result was a statistical draw where both candidates did better than expected in the eyes of the public.  The longer term impact worked out well for Obama who already had a lead going in, and benefited from solidifying that position.
The second debate on October 7, followed a town hall-style.  The questions came from audience members and the Internet, as chosen by the moderator.  Again the result was a statistical draw as far as who was considered to be the winner.  But with time running out for McCain, he needed something to make the people move his way, and that required a clear breakthrough that never happened
The final debate was held on October 15 concerned ""Domestic and Economic Policy."" Both candidates were again viewed as having done well, which was a tactical defeat for McCain as the poll numbers showed only small changes.

Vice Presidential Debate
There was one vice presidential debate held on October 2.  Palin did much better than expected, but Biden was also in top form.  No clear winner emerged and the poll numbers remained largely unchanged, a strategic win for the Democratic ticket that only had to maintain their lead to win the election.  The number of people who watched the debate was an alltime record for a Vice Presidential debate, and was viewed by more people than any of the three Presidential debates.

Third parties and Independents
As usual there were a number of third party candidates, but none made much of an impact.  Briefly the Libertarian Bob Barr had enough strength to become a spoiler for McCain.  He faded quickly. See United States Presidential Election, 2008 -- Third Party Candidates.

Primaries
For expanded primary information, see United States Presidential Election, 2008 - Primaries
The primary season for both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party officially began on January 3, 2008 with the Iowa Caucuses and ended on June 3, 2008.[14]  The 2008 election cycle saw a major shift in the primary election calendar, frontloading many primaries into early February.[15]
John McCain had to get his footing at first, but was pretty much assured the Republican nomination after Super Tuesday.  Barack Obama had a much tougher road, but rode out a string of victories in February to eventually outlast Clinton and take the nomination.  During that time he had raised more money than any other candidate in history giving him a huge boost, a trend that would continue into the general election.

2008 Financial Crisis,https://www.conservapedia.com/2008_Financial_Crisis,"The Financial Crisis of 2008 was a global financial crisis that is the worst the world has seen since 1933 with the Great Depression. Drastic measures to confront seemingly insurmountable financial calamity resulted in the creation of TARP (Troubled Assets Relief Program), $700 billion safety net appropriated by the U.S. Congress.  The National Bureau of Economic Research[1] has identified the peak of the last boom cycle in December 2007; the U.S. economy has been in decline ever since.[2]  Oct 11, 2008 editorial; cartoon by Horsey stresses the global collapse  The crisis has caused the Recession of 2008, which reached bottom in summer 2009, causing a worldwide economic decline that is the most severe since the 1930s. As of 2013, there are still 4 million fewer jobs in the U.S. than in 2008 - despite $5 trillion in federal stimulus spending.   
Some free market advocates believe Congress and the Federal Reserve should not have bailed out failing firms and instead should have allowed market mechanism to operate.[3][4]  A 2005 study found that government corporate bailouts are often done  more for political considerations, and the economic resources allocated exhibit significantly worse  performance than resources allocated using practical considerations [5]
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) calculated that the global financial crisis would produce $3.4 trillion in losses for financial institutions around the world by 2010.[6] World GDP in 2007 was approximately $70 trillion, so the immediate decline in the economic output of the planet was about 5%.

Overview
Negative economic news spread outward from financial institutions connected to Fannie Mae and the real estate boom to depress housing sales, construction, commercial real estate, automobiles, retail sales, state and local government, and virtually every other sector of the economy. Consumer confidence and spending plunged. Major banks and corporations went bankrupt. 
The recession was worldwide.  Initially governments across the world borrowed and spent huge sums of money to reverse the crisis, but the results were anaemic and the decline continued. By 2013, the notion of a Keynesian stimulus had been abandoned by the European Union, which cut it's budget in real terms, and the United States which invoked a sequestration of federal mandated spending to reduce the baseline for future years. While the prospect of deflation ordinarily would be real, the Federal Reserve had vastly increased the money supply both domestically and abroad with lending to foreign Central banks. Although the U.S. monetary base aggregates were four times larger than in mid 2007, federal spending was 50% more than in 2008, and  the accumulated national debt one-third greater, U.S. GDP output still lagged and the workforce was the size (134 million workers) as it was in 2003 - despite population having grown by 24 million people.  The U.S. government provided cash bailouts of several hundred billion dollars and long-term loan guarantees of over $7 trillion (compared to a GDP of $14.6 trillion in 2008).  
Unlike crises in the mid 1970s and early 1980s, the panic began in the financial and real estate sector with devastating effects on many very large financial companies worldwide, especially in September 2008.  The negative effects by October 2008 began spreading to all other sectors of the economy, and forecasts for the next several years showed little likelihood of recovery anywhere. For the effects on the broader economy (outside of finance and autos) see Recession of 2008.
The crisis originated with government-backed home loan guarantees in the United States, and has impacted every country in the world. Banks and financial companies reported losses of over one trillion dollars; investors suffered ""paper losses"" of many trillions. U.S. stocks went down 50% from their peak in 2007.[7] Paper losses for owners of stock in major financial institution were over 70%, and owners of some have lost 99% as major banks closed down. The stock market declined 50-70% in major countries and pension funds have large paper losses.  Paper losses in real estate have been in the trillions; the average price of American houses fell 20%, with 30% and higher declines in California and Florida.  However, thus far ordinary depositors with cash in the bank have suffered no losses. Owners of stocks in the 5000 largest U.S. corporations have paper losses of $10 trillion in 2008, dropping to $10 trillion in October from $20 trillion in late 2007. 

Liquidity crisis
In late September the crisis focused on liquidity—financial companies owned hundreds of billions of dollars of ""toxic"" real estate assets, mostly based on U.S. Fannie Mae-backed mortgages; they could not sell the toxic securities because no one knew how much they were worth, and large scale loans between major institutions stopped flowing as the system lost liquidity and froze up. A $800 billion rescue plan became law in the U.S. October 3. Meanwhile, Europe's sovereign debt crisis continued to deteriorate, as trillions of dollars in losses accumulated there and in many other countries.  International agencies such as the International Monetary Fund are giving guidance for medium-sized countries, like Pakistan and Ukraine.  In the panic, people around the world sent their money to the U.S. and Japan because the banks there are more tightly regulated and considered safer than their own banks.  The price of oil, which reached $145 a barrel in the summer, plunged to under $50. That plunge eased pump prices, helped commuters, and the airline industry.

 Tom Toles cartoon lampoons Federal bailout efforts as a badly designed bridge to nowhere, Dec. 1, 2008
Both parties have expressed anger at the crisis, and have promised extensive new regulations of the financial industry. The Republicans opposed additional bailout aid to General Motors, which was on the verge of bankruptcy.[8] Democratic Congressional leaders and President Barack Obama had the United States Treasury take control of General Motors while paying existing shareholders 22 cents on the dollar for their investment and claims, and not demanding any meaningful concessions from the labor unions to bring wages more in line with a competitive world standard.
The Bush administration undertook a program in which it took control of several of the largest financial institutions and government sponsored entities (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and AIG insurance) at the heart of the crisis, forced mergers of others, purchased $125 billion of ownership in the 9 largest banks in the U.S., and provided relief to the largest bank, Citigroup.
Until October the crisis had little impact on the non-financial sectors of the world economy, but then negative impacts started appearing.  Companies could not borrow money for expansion or in some cases for routine operations, and had to cut back. Consumer spending fell and unemployment rose sharply.  By Election day in November pessimistic reports were coming in daily from practically every sector of the  American economy. There were no bright spots, and with tax revenues down, state governments began large-scale cutbacks, especially in New York and California.
By late October it appeared the financial crisis was causing a slowdown of all the economies of  the world, and a serious recession with widespread unemployment and business failures The Federal Reserve took aggressive steps to dissolve the liquidity freeze and to allow lending to flow again.

Causes
As hundreds of billions of dollars poured into the U.S. from abroad, financiers looked for imaginative ways to make a profit. They turned to real estate, with the philosophy ""Buy high--sell higher!""  The higher price paid for a house the more profit would be made when it was resold (""flipped"") in six or 12 months; prices were certain to keep going up and up. Salesmen made big money by phoning prospective buyers, promising to get them Bog Money Quick.  People who owned a house whose value had doubled could and did refinance their mortgage for the higher amount, and keep the difference.  In the early 2000s, U.S. interest rates were low and demand for housing was high, as housing prices soared, especially in California, Florida, Nevada and Arizona. Mortgage companies and banks were very eager to lend, especially to people with mediocre credit who would not previously have been eligible for mortgages and to speculators. Speculators were ordinary people who already had a house and who were hoping to make a large profit on the purchase and quick resale (""flip"") of another house or condominium, which no one ever lived in.[9]  The expectation was that continuously rising house prices would cover the mortgage payments through refinancing. Many of the mortgages involved very low down payments and low monthly payments for the first year or two, after which the payments would start soaring. Sometimes the monthly payment at first was zero. 
Both the Bush and Clinton administrations made it a national priority to encourage more people to buy houses, assuming this social engineering would be good for everyone. In 2000 Howard Husock warned that the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 and its expansion in 1995 would prove expensive; but President Bush strongly endorsed the program. Despite widespread misunderstanding they did not cause the great crisis since CRA loans to poor neighborhoods comprised only about 6% of the toxic mortgages.[10]
""Option adjustable rate mortgages"" (nicknamed ""Pick-A-Pay"") allowed borrowers to vary their monthly payments; they could be so so small they did not cover their interest charges. That meant the total principal grows over time, compared to normal mortgages where the debt owed shrinks over 30 years to zero and the borrower owns the house free and clear. By 2008 banks sold these dangerous ""option adjustable rate"" mortgages to two million customers.  They made sense if and only if the price of houses kept going up and the borrower could sell it in a year ot two at a huge profit. But if house prices declined, the borrower could stop paying and the bank was left with the loss.

The NYTimes says Senator Charles Schumer D-NY, is the most responsible for Wall Street's collapse.[11] Schumer as a member of the Banking and Finance Committees, led efforts to regulate credit-rating agencies, shield financial institutions from government oversight and tougher regulations, and saved key industry players billions of dollars in taxes and fees.

Selling Fannie Mae-backed mortgage bundles to pension funds and institutional investors
Americans owed some $10 trillion on their mortgages, most of which were sound with payments made on time. However financiers bundled the mortgages into very complicated packages called ""collateralized debt obligations'[12] or CDOs. Hundreds of billions of dollars worth of CDO's were sold to banks, pension funds and financiers in the U.S. and Europe. Generally they borrowed cash to buy the CDOs.  The risk was that if the CDO's declined in value, they would not be able to repay those loans.  The CDOs were especially attractive because they were not regulated by the government; experts are not sure how many trillions of dollars are involved.
Many mortgages were held or originated by mortgage companies like Countrywide and Washington Mutual, as well as investment banks such as Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, as well as commercial banking chains like Wachovia and Bank of America, which have thousands of local offices.

Commercial real estate
The speculative real-estate bubble went far beyond residential homes, it infected as well all kinds of commercial real estate,[13] such as office buildings, shopping centers, apartment complexes, hotels, casinos and even empty lots. People bought high expecting to  sell higher, and were stunned when the market collapsed. People who loaned money to real estate firms were confident of a 20% return, but more likely lost 25%. The value of office buildings plunged 43% after the peak in Nov. 2007.  Most investors who bought in 2007 probably lost all their investment.
For example, in 2006 at the top of the market Tishman Speyer Properties and BlackRock Realty invested $5.4 billion to buy the largest apartment complex in the United States, in downtown New York City. Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, with 110 buildings and 11,227 apartments housing median income families. The plan was to spend billions in upgrades, and as tenants moved out, to raise the rents.  The expectation proved wildly overoptimistic, and the monthly rents collected did not cover the debt payments. In January 2010 Tishman Speyer and BlackRock turned over the property to creditors, taking a 100% loss.[14]

Misuse of Credit Default Swaps
Another key contributing factor to the credit market meltdown was the misuse of Credit Default Swaps, or CDSs, which are contracts between entities designed to mitigate against risk of a credit default.  A CDS is essentially an insurance policy[15] designed to protect the insured party against excessive losses in a separate financial transaction.  However, by structuring the contract as a derivative swap instead of a traditional insurance policy, companies other than regulated insurers[16] could offer them.  This created two critical risk exposures to the insured companies, and collectively to the overall market.  First, traditional insurers are required to maintain a sufficient level of capital reserves to pay on losses, while companies issuing CDSs were not.  Since investments in pooled mortgages were viewed as unlikely to devalue or fail, major issuers of CDSs like AIG and Lehman Brothers found themselves over-exposed to losses.  The second risk was that CDSs issued by one firm were typically hedged, or backed up financially, by CDSs with other companies.  The strategy of minimizing risk by dividing it into collections of smaller exposures with other companies is a sound practice, but when the original risk is overexposed that overexposure is then spread across the companies that participate in the secondary risk markets.  
AIG, the world's largest insurance company, was a major player in the financial crisis because it sold $441 billion in unhedged and undercapitalized insurance on securitized debt, much of it tied to mortgage values.  Normally an insurance company ""lays off"" some of the risk by taking out insurance with another company.  AIG neglected to do this because it never expected the securities to turn toxic,[17] which they did.  Either someone paid the insurance or the nation's financial system would colapse, so the government stepped in, seized AIG, and paid the insurance.  
The effect of these risks manifested themselves in two key ways.  First, when major players in the CDS market like Bear Sterns and AIG were found to be insolvent, or failed outright like Lehman Brothers, the default conditions that were tied to the risk-spreading CDS's were triggered, and many companies found themselves obligated to pay out on contracts they never expected to.  These sudden exposures led to capital and liquidity shortages at scores of firms involved in the secondary credit markets, and the default pattern started repeating on itself in an echo-like manner.  Since the complex, interdependent nature of the CDS market made it difficult for firms to assess their true exposure to loss in this unprecedented market, they refrained from both short-term and long-term lending to guard against further losses.  This essentially led to a freezing up of credit in the marketplace, as lenders refusing to give credit to other lenders translated into businesses and consumers being unable to get short-term operating loans to meet payroll, or borrow for homes, autos, student loans, or credit-card accounts as before.  
This freezing of the markets to avoid loss was the primary incentive for the U.S. government's Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which injected billions of dollars of government-backed funds into the credit markets to restore confidence and liquidity.

Bubble bursts
The housing ""bubble"" burst in 2006-07, as prices plunged downward in the Sunbelt. Many speculators and homeowners could not meet their payments, especially those who had ""sub-prime"" mortgages because their income was too low to support the eventual monthly payments, or who had adjustable rate mortgages where the monthly payments started small then escalated.   Foreclosures skyrocketed. With housing prices falling few people risked buying a new house (because it would soon be worth less than they paid for it). Construction firms had built millions of new houses that could not be sold but which glutted the market.  By late 2008 half the home sales in the U.S. were by banks selling houses they had foreclosed on at low prices. 
The problem was that no one could figure out what CDOs were now worth, so very few were willing to buy them.  One major investment bank, Merrill Lynch, sold its CDOs for 22 cents on the dollar—a ""fire sale"" price that was less than they were worth in the long run, because in the long run the great majority of people will make their scheduled mortgage payments.

2008 crises
Multiple crises started pulling down major financial players.  Countrywide, which originated 20% of all American mortgages in 2006, collapsed and was bought up by Bank of America.  Bear Stearns, a large investment bank, went under; the government arranged a sale to JPMorgan Chase; stock holders lost about 90% of their investment, and the confidence in other banks was undermined.
On September 7, 2008, the government took control of the two largest mortgage holders, ""Fannie Mae""[18] and ""Freddie Mac.""[19] The two had lost $15 billion on the $5.4 trillion in mortgages they owned, and their notes were widely held in China and many other countries.  The fear was that if the Treasury did not act the world's confidence in the US financial system would collapse.  However the rest of the world was in trouble too.  The stock markets in China and Russia plunged 50%, and the British Treasury had to take over its largest mortgage company, Northern Rock.  Vast sums of money flowed into the US because it was safer there than anywhere else.

 Panic in Wall Street, Sept. 2008; the ""bull"" is the symbol of optimism on Wall Street and the ""bear"" is the symbol of pessimism.  Here the bull panics.
By September the major banks were no longer lending money and most reported huge losses as they wrote down the value of the CDOs and other assets. Short sellers sold large amounts of stock in threatened companies, causing further panic and driving down share prices.[20] Lehman Brothers, one of the oldest and largest banks in New York, went bankrupt on Sept. 15 with no one to rescue it.  The collapse of Lehman with its $639 billion in assets had a multiplier effect worldwide, severely weakening other big banks and sharply increasing the level of fear and distrust inside the system that caused bankers to sharply reduce their lending.  Many large firms and hedge funds had borrowed billions of dollars from lenders and had pledged assets they owned as collateral. When the value of their collateral plummeted, the lenders demanded more collateral to make up the difference, so the borrowers had to sell assets to raise emergency cash.  The price of the assets they sold was falling, and large additional sales further depressed prices, creating a downward spiral. 
Merrill Lynch was sold to Bank of America for $50 billion, about half its value a few months before. Investors realized that AIG could no longer honor the insurance policies it wrote. It lost $13 billion in the first half of 2008 and its shares fell 95% in value. AIG was ""too big"" to be allowed to fail, so it was given an $85 billion loan from the government; in return the government received 80% of its stock. The government had to add another $38 billion to the AIG rescue in October.[21]  In effect AIG, along with GSE (government-sponsored enterprises) Fanny Mae and Freddy Mac were nationalized.  The Federal Reserve, with $800 billion in assets, was assisted by the Treasury, which gave it more funds.[22]

European crises
Heavy borrowing by European banks meant the crisis immediately affected Britain and other countries as well, as the British housing bubble burst about the same time as the U.S. The British government had to take over major mortgage lenders, including Northern Rock in February, 2008.  Northern Rock's loans (£25 billion) and guarantees (£30 billion) extended by the Bank of England, together with the value of the company's mortgages (£55 billion), or £100 billion in all, were added to the British national debt.  Bradford & Bingley, half the size of Northern Rock, held £40 billion in toxic mortgages, and was nationalized in late September. 

Fortis
In late September, the Fortis bank, the world's 20th largest business, was partially nationalized by three governments who injected $16 billion in emergency funds. In 2007 Fortis borrowed heavily for its $100 billion takeover of rival bank ABN Amro; the deal came at the market's peak, and Fortis now cannot pay its debts. The Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments tried to inject capital but as consumer confidence plunged, Netherlands nationalized the Dutch wing of the company and the rest was sold in early October to the French bank BNP Paribas for €14.5 billion euros ($19 billion). 

Germany
In Germany Hypo Real Estate was given €50 billion euros ($68 billion) bailout by the government.  The government of Iceland took over its large banks, as the entire island economy verged on bankruptcy because it depended so much on large foreign loans. Most of the European countries hurriedly announced guarantees of personal bank deposits to avert further drop in consumer confidence and runs on the banks.  Stock markets around the world continue to decline as pessimism worsens.

Central banks
The European Central Bank aggressively lent money to banks trying to ensure that banks would have adequate cash. The moves have not reassured savers or investors, and European stock markets have fallen even further than the American stock markets, as have the stock markets in China and Russia.  
On October 13, France, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and Austria committed €1.3 trillion euros ($1.8 trillion) to guarantee bank loans and take stakes in banks, in an emergency effort to head off the collapse of their financial systems.[23]

Britain
Britain on October 8 announced a gigantic £400 billion ($680 billion) rescue plan for its banks; the government would partially own them.  Prime Minister Gordon Brown said banks would still be run by their old managers, but that the government would have to be ""satisfied"" on matters of salaries, dividends and lending activities.  The money involved is about a third of Britain's annual GDP (comparable to $5 trillion in the U.S. economy.)
On October 13, Britain announced it would spend £50 billion ($85 billion) to nationalize two of the five largest banks, HBOS (Halifax Bank of Scotland) and RBS (Royal Bank of Scotland), while taking partial ownership of a third, Lloyds TSB. A fourth, Barclays will remain private if it can raise an additional £7 billion. The fifth, HSBC is based in Hong Kong and will remain private.[24]

Switzerland
In October 2008, the Swiss central bank and the big UBS bank reached an agreement to transfer as much as $60 billion of troubled securities and other assets from UBS's to a separate entity. UBS will put up $6 billion in equity. The Swiss central bank will control the new entity and loan it $54 billion.

Asia
The crisis swept across the Middle East and Asia as well, with South Korea especially hard hit.  China, which had been the world's major growth machine in recent years, seemed to slow down. In November China's government announced it would spend 4 trillion yuan ($586 billion) through the end of 2010 to stimulate its economy. It specifically targeted people's livelihood in an effort to offset the impact of slowing global demand for its exports and unlock the spending power of its vast population.

Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)
""We're in the midst of a serious financial crisis,"" President Bush warned the nation on Sept. 25, 2008.:

Major financial institutions have teetered on the edge of collapse, and some have failed. As uncertainty has grown, many banks have restricted lending. Credit markets have frozen. And families and businesses have found it harder to borrow money....without immediate action by Congress, America could slip into a financial panic, and a distressing scenario would unfold: More banks could fail, including some in your community. The stock market would drop even more, which would reduce the value of your retirement account. The value of your home could plummet. Foreclosures would rise dramatically. And if you own a business or a farm, you would find it harder and more expensive to get credit. More businesses would close their doors, and millions of Americans could lose their jobs. Even if you have good credit history, it would be more difficult for you to get the loans you need to buy a car or send your children to college. And ultimately, our country could experience a long and painful recession.[25]
On September 19, 2008, the Treasury and Federal Reserve proposed a major rescue plan—the largest government intervention in the economy since World War II. The plan was for the Treasury to purchase $700 billion of the CDOs. The buyout was needed, Bush said, to avert a major disaster for the economy.  Most (but not all) Democrats signed on to the plan, adding provisions for Congressional oversight and caps on CEO compensation; but at the last moment on Sept 25, 2008 House Republicans said no, and GOP presidential nominee John McCain held off endorsement.  
Conservatives were split on what to do.  Many agreed with Bush that the program proposed by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson was urgently needed. Large banks and corporations strongly endorsed the it.  The American Bankers Association and the Mortgage Bankers Association are fighting against any amendment that would reduce mortgage obligations for people in bankruptcy, while directing all the government funds to the banking industry.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, normally an outspoken advocate of big corporate interests, instead stressed the crisis's impact on small and midsize businesses. ""We're looking at an economy that was slipping toward recession even before this crisis culminated in a market lockup last week,"" said Chamber economist Martin Regalia. The debate in Congress, he said, ""is costing every American taxpayer money, directly.""[26]  Democratic nominee Senator Barack Obama endorsed the plan, as amended by Congressional Democrats. On the other hand, ordinary taxpayers and ""Main Street,"" that is businessmen who operated at the local level, were highly suspicious of Wall Street. McCain, blaming the crisis on ""the corruption and manipulation of our home mortgage system,"" rejected the bailout as a favor for Wall Street and little help to Main Street. Advocates of the market economy insisted that the market should run its course, and opposed the government intervention.[27]  The fiscally irresponsible TARP program increased the national debt by $300 million in 2009.[28]
A compromise was agreed to by leaders of both parties but the ""Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008"" (EESA)  was voted down in the House on Sept. 29.   Democrats favored the Bush bill 60%-40%, but Republicans voted no by  65-35%. The stock market lost a trillion dollars in value in one day as uncertainty reigned.  Finally a large majority passed a more expensive bill, that added $100 billion in new subsidies to the original $700 billion, plus tax breaks and a rise in FDIC insurance to $250,000 from $100,000, intended to reassure ordinary depositors. Both Obama and McCain voted for this version of the bill. 
The Treasury TARP program proved erratic and had to be radically modified several times. The Treasury dropped the original plan to buy toxic securities and instead has used $250 billion to prop up major banks. In October Paulson and Bernanke used their new powers to take an ownership stake in the nine largest U.S. banks, of $7 to $25 billion each. These banks are now partly owned and controlled by the government. However those banks are keeping the money and not lending it out. The price of bank stocks has fallen sharply since the relief program was passed. The world's largest bank, Citigroup, was on the verge of collapse in late November and received a second loan of $20 billion (in addition to $25 billion in October), and a federal guarantee to cover most of its toxic investments.
In mid-December Bush announced that $17.4 billion of TARP funds would be given to the automobile industry in the form of bridge loans,[29] just enough to prevent the companies from going bankrupt for a few weeks.[30] Bush defended the move by saying ""if we were to allow the free market to take its course now, it would almost certainly lead to disorderly bankruptcy and liquidation for the automakers.""[29]
By mid-November the market had lost confidence in Treasury Secretary Paulson, who indicated he was baffled and would let the incoming Obama administration handle the unspent $450 billion.  The stock market jumped 6% on the news that Obama had picked New York banker Timothy Geithner to replace Paulson.[31]  In late November the Federal Reserve announced it will buy up to $600 billion in mortgage-related assets from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, hoping to restart the housing and credit markets.  Under the new ""Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility,"" or TALF, the Federal Reserve will loan up to $200 billion to financial companies that hold securities backed by consumer and small-business loans. 
Hedge funds are private investment companies with a combined $1.7 trillion in assets. They have lost $180 billion since July and some are near collapse. Investors are demanding their money back, and Wall Street in late October is bracing for a shake-out in the industry.[32]
In late November the government announced an $800 billion plan to boost consumer credit and the market for mortgage-related securities. Plans call for the Federal Reserve in early 2009 to extend up to $200 billion in non-recourse loans to holders of asset-backed securities backed by highly rated consumer and small business loans.[33] Treasury will contribute $20 billion in funds through its Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The Federal Reserve also announced it will purchase up to $100 billion in GSE (government-sponsored enterprises, especially Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac) debt through a series of competitive auctions starting in December, 2008. The Federal Reserve starting in December will purchase up to $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities backed by GSEs such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the Fed is preparing to launch new liquidity programs to support the economy in addition to further slashing interests rates.  The total commitments by the government in relief and loan guarantees exceeded $7 trillion, but the economy nevertheless continued to slip downward.[34]

Deepening recession
By early December the entire economy was heading downward with no bright spots. The recession that began in Dec. 2007 intensified, as retail sales plunged. In November 2008 Americans, their confidence shaken, saved their money and sharply reduced their credit card purchases. Auto sales were down 37% in November (compared to Nov. 2007) to the lowest rate in 26 years. GM sales fell 41% Ford fell 31% and the foreign cars were down just as much, with Toyota down 34%, Nissan down 42% and Honda down 32%.[35] Retailers rang up the lowest November sales in more than 30 years, as holiday shopping not only failed to lift the economy but showed that the crisis is further distressing everyday consumers. Thirty major companies—including Macy's, Sears, Abercrombie & Fitch and Target—posted sales declines; Wal-Mart, anchoring the bottom of the price chain, sawincreased sales.  Retail sales in November fell 2.7 percent compared with the same month last year.[36]

 
The Federal Reserve reported on Dec. 3, 2008, that every region reported sales declines, drops in manufacturing activity, weakening real estate markets, tighter lending, and deteriorating labor marketsThose sectors that had been strong until recently—especially as agriculture and energy—also softened as commodity prices declined.  November saw 533,000 jobs disappear in the worst one-month decline in 34 years.

Shadow TARP
In 2011, it was revealed that the Federal Reserve secretly propped up elite bankers all the way from Wall Street to Brussels to the Central Bank of Libya.[37] This was the Fed covertly operating its own bailout program. The names of those involved were revealed by Bloomberg News and it took several years of Freedom of Information Act court battles to unearth Fed actions. The Fed would have never revealed its secret bailout on its own.

Collapse of #6 and #4 largest banks, rescue of #1
Washington Mutual collapses
On Sept. 25, Washington Mutual, the 6th largest bank in the US with $310 billion in assets, went bankrupt after a run in which depositors withdrew $17 billion in a few days. Its stockholders lost all their money, the US government took it over (through the FDIC, which insures ordinary bank deposits), and resold it the same day to the biggest New York bank, JPMorgan Chase. It was the largest commercial bank failure in American history, by far.[38]

Wachovia collapses
Meanwhile, the #4 U.S. bank, Wachovia, burdened by $120 billion in toxic securities,[39] was bought out by Citigroup on Sept. 29 in a deal engineered by the FDIC.  However Wachovia then broke its deal and merged into Wells Fargo. The result is that four major banks now dominate the American economy (Bank of America, Citibank, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo), along with dozens of regional chains and thousands of small local banks.

Bank of America renegotiates mortgages
In early October, Bank of America, the new owner of Countrywide, reached a settlement with 11 states that sued it over fraudulent practices. The state of Illinois accused Countrywide of relaxing underwriting standards, structuring loans with risky features, and misleading consumers with hidden fees and fake marketing claims, like a false promise of a ""no closing costs loan."" Countrywide gave special incentives to its brokers for selling impossible loans by paying higher commissions on them. In reviewing one Illinois mortgage broker's sales, the Illinois complaint said the ""vast majority of the loans had inflated income, almost all without the borrower’s knowledge.""  Bank of America did not deny the charges and instead agreed to pay out $8.4 billion to 400,000 Countrywide customers. Countrywide will reduce principal balances for some people and cut interest rates for others. Rates for some people could decline to as low as 2.5% and remain at that level for five years.  Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and IndyMac, now all owned by the federal government, have begun their own programs to modify mortgage terms for some hard-pressed borrowers.
[40]

Largest bank rescued
Citigroup, the world's largest bank was tottering in late November despite its receipt of $25 billion in TARP funding. Its value on the stock market plunged to $21 billion, down from $244 billion two years ago.  Round after round of layoffs have ended 75,000 jobs in 2008 out of 375,000 employees a year ago.  Very heavy exposure to toxic mortgages is the main culprit.  The government stepped in with the largest relief effort yet, including $20 billion in new cash, and guarantees of toxic assets by the Treasury, FDIC and Federal Reserve.
At all times Citigroup used elaborate mathematical risk models that looked at mortgages in particular geographical areas, but never included the possibility of a national housing downturn, or the prospect that millions of mortgage holders would default on their mortgages. The prevailing approach at Citigroup and the other big banks was to make money as fast as possible (generating annual bonuses of $10 to $30 million for senior executives), which assigning zero to the risk of a system-wide downturn. Such a downturn came with disastrous consequences for Citigroup and its rivals on Wall Street.  Even after Bear Stearns ran into serious trouble in summer 2007, Citigroup decided the possibility of trouble with its CDO's was so tiny (less than 1/100 of 1%) that they excluded them from their risk analysis.  
Despite two federal efforts Citigroup is still wobbly. It holds $20 billion of mortgage-linked securities that have been marked down to between 21 cents and 41 cents on the dollar. It has billions of dollars of giant buyout and corporate loans of dubious value. And it also faces a potential massive losses on auto, mortgage and credit card loans as the economy worsens.[41]
By the end of 2009 most big banks were in much better shape and the Treasury expects to recover all but $42 billion of the $370 billion it lent to ailing companies, with the portion lent to banks actually showing a slight profit.  Meanwhile, over 120 small and medium banks have been shut as insolvent; in most cases the FDIC picks up the losses and another bank takes over the operations and branches.[42]

Auto stimulus
In 2008 a series of damaging blows drove the ""Big Three"" (GM, Ford and Chrysler) to the verge of bankruptcy. Part of the cause was very high labor costs (much higher than the foreign plants in the U.S.), and lack of consumer demand for their products. The Big Three had in recent years stressed expensive, fuel-guzzling SUVs and large pickups. They were much more profitable than smaller, fuel-efficient cars. When gasoline prices shot past $4 in 2008, Americans stopped buying the big cars, and the Big Three saw their sales plummet.  The Financial Crisis played a role as no one was willing to loan GM the money to buy Chrysler. Consumer credit has tightened and it became much harder for people with average or poor credit to obtain a bank loan to buy a car, so sales fell further.  Stock prices plummeted as shareholders worried about bankruptcy; GM's shares fell to 1946 levels. Intense debate ensued about a massive bailout, that would be in addition to a $25 billion loan Congress passed in September 2008 to assist in increasing fuel efficiency. President Bush proposed changing the terms of that loan so it could be used to cover daily operating expenses, but Congress rejected that. Republicans in Congress in mid-November blocked Democratic proposals to underwrite a new bailout of the auto industry, as industry leaders made an unconvincing case before Congress.  President Obama and Democrats in Congress have demanded the Big Three come up with a highly specific plan with some chance of long-term viability. Critics claimed the proposals would lead to unnecessary job loss.
In addition to the Big Three hundreds of large suppliers of parts are in financial crisis as well; most would go under if the Big Three go bankrupt.
Intense debate in December 2008 focused on allowing bankruptcy or injecting billions more of federal aid; it would be in addition to a $25 billion loan Congress passed in September 2008 to assist in increasing fuel efficiency.  The Democrats in Congress supported president Bush's proposal to use the fuel-efficiency loans to help with the immediate problem. It passed the House but Senate Republicans broke with Bush and it failed.  The opponents called for a bankruptcy that would allow GM to get out of its contracts to pay union members high wages, as well as generous pensions and medical benefits to retired workers.  Bush then acted unilaterally and decided to make TARP loans to  GM and Chrysler, on December 19. GM and Chrysler will get $13.4 billions in loans they can use to pay their suppliers.[43] GM can receive another $4 billion in February, but by then the Obama administration will be in charge, and it is emphasizing the need for a long-range solution.[44]

Bankruptcy scenario
Bankruptcy of Chrysler and GM took place in the second quarter of 2009. Chrysler's sale to Italian automaker Fiat has been finalized. GM received billions more dollars to prevent bankruptcy but fell none-the-less. In addition, GM will require $30 billion in the first stage of bankruptcy. The Obama Administration is the single largest shareholder with the UAW second at 17% ownership. Also, many auto dealerships have been shuttered, thousands of workers have been laidoff, assembly plants closed, and product lines dissolved or sold.

Obama Administration
 Critics feared Geithner's vague plans would crash
The Obama Administration, taking office on Jan. 20, 2009,  moved to handle the crisis on two fronts.  Working with Democrats in Congress (and three moderate Republican Senators), it passed the ""American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009,"" calling for $500 billion of new spending and nearly $300 billion in new tax cuts. The new law began operations in mid-February, 2009, and supporters hoped it would slow and turn around the nosediving economy.  Conservative critics feared it would be ineffective in the short run and add to the national debt and tax burdens in the long run. As of late March no results are visible.
With major banks on the verge of failure, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner unveiled yet another massive bailout program in mid-February. Trillions would be spent to move toxic assets out of the banks, but few details were provided. The widespread reaction was very negative, and Geithner lost more of his credibility as a problem solver.  Geither finally came back with a plan on March 23 that will not need additional funding or approval by Congress.  The Treasury will use $100 billion from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), as well as new capital from private investors, in order to generate $500 billion in purchasing power to buy toxic loans and assets. The program could potentially expand to $1 trillion over time.

Criticisms
The nations banks now lend 25% less than when the financial bailout was announced. 
 The USA relies on China to buy our U.S. Treasury bonds to fund the increased spending. 
America is a debtor nation, we spend more than we save. The dollars value has plummeted against world currencies. Gold prices remain at record levels.The money that we don't have, but spend, will be a debt that future generations will have to worry about. This has brought rise to the term 'Generational Theft' in describing Obama policies.
""It's time to terminate the TARP program,"" Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, told reporters on Monday. ""TARP is increasingly not being a vehicle for economic stability and taxpayer protection but is evolving into 700 billion dollar revolving slush fund that the administration can use to advance economic, social and political agenda items far and apart from what Tarp was ever designed to do."" [45]
In the view of 51 mostly conservative economists polled by the Wall Street Journal in July 2009, the Obama administration's performance is problematic. President Obama and Treasury Secretary Geithner both got an average grade of 70 out of 100 for their handling of the financial crisis, but those grades varied widely. Former President Bush and ex-Treasury chief Paulson got average grades of 50 and 60, respectively, when economists were asked how they handled the crisis while in office. By contrast, Fed chairman Bernanke scores much better, with an average grade of 85; in addition 93% of respondents said he should be reappointed by Obama when Bernanke's term expires early next year.[46]

New England
For a more detailed treatment, see New England.
The Plymouth Colony, now part of Massachusetts, was founded by the Pilgrims, a small Puritan sect based in England and the Netherlands. One group sailed on the Mayflower. They drew up the Mayflower Compact by which they gave themselves broad powers of self-governance and introduced democracy into America.  They established the small Plymouth Colony in 1620 and later merged with the Massachusetts Bay colony. William Bradford (1590-1657) was the main leader. 

Puritans
For a more detailed treatment, see Puritans.
The Puritans, a much larger group than the Pilgrims, established the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1629 with 400 settlers. This group was the Puritans who sought to reform the Church of England by creating a new, pure church in the New World. Within two years, an additional 2,000 arrived. The Puritans created a deeply religious, socially tight-knit and politically innovative culture that still lingers on in the modern United States. They hoped this new land would serve as a ""redeemer nation."" Seeking the true religion, they fled England and in America created a ""nation of saints"" or the ""City upon a hill,"" an intensely religious, thoroughly righteous community designed to be an example for all of Europe. Roger Williams, who preached religious toleration, separation of Church and State, and a complete break with the Church of England, was banished and founded Rhode Island Colony, which became a haven for other religious refugees from the Puritan community, including Anne Hutchinson, a preacher of Antinomianism.
Economically, Puritan New England fulfilled the expectations of its founders. Unlike the cash-crop oriented plantations of the Chesapeake region, the Puritan economy was based on the efforts of individual farmers, who harvested enough crops to feed themselves and their families and a surplus to trade for goods they could not produce themselves. There was a generally higher standard of living in New England than in the Chesapeake. Along with farming growth, New England became an important mercantile and shipbuilding center, often serving as the hub for trading between the South and Europe.

The Middle Colonies, consisting of the present-day states of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware, were characterized by a large degree of diversity—religious, political, economic, and ethnic.  Many Dutch and Protestant Irish immigrants settled in these areas, as well as in Long Island and Connecticut. The Germans, called ""Pennsylvania Dutch,"" were included in this emigration.

Mid-Atlantic Region
Unlike New England, the Mid-Atlantic Region gained much of its population from new immigration, and by 1750, the combined populations of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania had reached nearly 300,000 people. By 1750, about 60,000 Scots-Irish and 50,000 Germans came to live in British North America, many of them settling in the Mid-Atlantic Region. William Penn, the man who founded the colony of Pennsylvania in 1682, attracted an influx of Quakers and other immigrants with his policies of religious liberty and freehold ownership. ""Freehold"" meant that farmers owned their land free and clear of leases. The first major influx of immigrants came mainly from Ireland and consisted of Scots-Irish Presbyterians. The second major immigration came with Germans trying to escape the religious conflicts and declining economic opportunities in Germany and Switzerland.

Much of the architecture of the Middle Colonies reflects the diversity of its peoples. In Albany and New York City, a majority of the buildings were Dutch style with brick exteriors and high gables at each end while many Dutch churches were shaped liked an octagon. Using cut stone to build their houses, German and Welsh settlers in Pennsylvania followed the way of their homeland and completely ignored the plethora of timber in the area. Thus in Germantown, Pennsylvania, 80% of the buildings in the town were made entirely of stone. On the other hand, the Scots-Irish took advantage of America's ample supply of timber and constructed sturdy log cabins.
Ethnic cultures also effected the styles of furniture. Rural Quakers preferred simple designs in furnishings such as tables, chairs, chests and shunned elaborate decorations. However, some urban Quakers had much more elaborate furniture. The city of Philadelphia became a major center of furniture-making because of its massive wealth from Quaker and British merchants. Philadelphian cabinet makers built elegant desks and highboys. German artisans created intricate carved designs on their chests and other furniture with painted scenes of flowers and birds. German potters also crafted a large array of jugs, pots, and plates, of both elegant and traditional design.
There were ethnic differences in the treatment of women. Among Puritan settlers in New England, wives almost never worked in the fields with their husbands. In German communities in Pennsylvania, however, many women worked in fields and stables. German and Dutch immigrants granted women more control over property, which was not permitted in the local English law. Unlike English colonial wives, German and Dutch wives owned their own clothes and other items and were also given the ability to write wills disposing of the property brought into the marriage.

Farming
The Europeans brought entirely new animals, which transformed the landscape, such as hogs, cattle, horses, sheep and poulry. (The Indians already had dogs.) Ethnicity made a difference in agricultural practice. As an example, German farmers generally preferred oxen rather than horses to pull their plows and Scots-Irish made a farming economy based on hogs and corn. In Ireland, Scots-Irish farmed intensively, working small pieces of land trying to get the largest possible production-rate from their crops. In the American colonies, Scots-Irish focused on mixed-farming. Using this technique, they grew corn for human consumption and as feed for hogs and other livestock. Many improvement-minded farmers of all different backgrounds began using new agricultural practices to raise their output. During the 1750s, these agricultural innovators replaced the hand sickles and scythes used to harvest hay, wheat, and barley with the cradle scythe, a tool with wooden fingers that arranged the stalks of grain for easy collection. This tool was able to triple the amount of work down by farmers in one day. Farmers also began fertilizing their fields with dung and lime and rotating their crops to keep the soil fertile.
Before 1720, most colonists in the mid-Atlantic region worked with small-scale farming and paid for imported manufactures by supplying the West Indies with corn and flour. In New York, a fur-pelt export trade to Europe flourished adding additional wealth to the region. After 1720, mid-Atlantic farming stimulated with the international demand for wheat. A massive population explosion in Europe brought wheat prices up. By 1770, a bushel of wheat cost twice as much as it did in 1720. Farmers also expanded their production of flaxseed and wheat since flax was a high demand in the Irish linen industry and a demand for wheat for slaves existed in the West Indies.
Some immigrants who just arrived purchased farms and shared in this export wealth, but many poor German and Scots-Irish immigrants were forced to work as agricultural wage laborers. Merchants and artisans also hired these homeless workers for a domestic system for the manufacture of cloth and other goods. Merchants often bought wool and flax from farmers and employed newly arrived immigrants, who had been textile workers in Ireland and Germany, to work in their homes spinning the materials into yarn and cloth. Large farmers and merchants became wealthy, while farmers with smaller farms and artisans only made enough for subsistence. The Mid-Atlantic region, by 1750, was divided by both ethnic background and wealth.

Seaports
Seaports, which expanded from wheat trade, had more social classes than anywhere else in the Middle Colonies. By 1750, the population of Philadelphia had reached 25,000, New York 15,000, and the port of Baltimore 7,000. Merchants dominated seaport society and about 40 merchants controlled half of Philadelphia's trade. Wealthy merchants in Philadelphia and New York, like their counterparts in New England, built elegant Georgian-style mansions. 
Shopkeepers, artisans, shipwrights, butchers, coopers (barrell makers), seamstresses, cobblers, bakers, carpenters, stonemasons, and many other specialized professions, made up the middle class of seaport society. Wives and husbands often worked as a team and taught their children their crafts to pass it on through the family. Many of these artisans and traders made enough money to create a modest life. 
Laborers stood at the bottom of seaport society. These poor people worked on the docks unloading inbound vessels and loading outbound vessels with wheat, corn, and flaxseed. Many of these were African American; some were free while others were enslaved. In 1750, blacks made up about 10 percent of the population of New York and Philadelphia. Hundreds of seamen, some who were African American, worked as sailors on merchant ships.

The Southern Colonies were mainly dominated by the wealthy slave-owning planters in Maryland, Virginia, and South Carolina. These planters owned massive estates that were worked by African slaves. Of the 650,000 inhabitants of the South in 1750, about 250,000 or 40 percent, were slaves. Planters used their wealth to dominate the local tenants and yeoman farmers. At election time, they gave these farmers gifts of rum and promised to lower taxes to take control of colonial legislatures. 

South: Chesapeake Bay area
Jamestown
The first successful English colony was Jamestown, established in 1607, on a small river near Chesapeake Bay.  The venture was financed and coordinated by the London Virginia Company, a joint stock company looking for gold. Its first years were extremely difficult, with very high death rates from disease and starvation, wars with local Indians, and little gold. The colony barely survived, by turning to tobacco as a cash crop. By the late 17th century Virginia's export economy was largely based on tobacco, and new, richer settlers came in to take up large portions of land, build large plantations and import indentured servants and slaves.  In 1676 Bacon's Rebellion occurred, but was suppressed by royal officials. After Bacon's Rebellion, African slaves replaced  English indentured servants as Virginia's main labor force.  The indentured servants became independent farmers at age 21, and mostly became subsistence farmers.
The colonial assembly that had governed the colony since its establishment was dissolved but was reinstated in 1630. It shared power with a royally appointed governor.  On a more local level, governmental power was invested in county courts and sheriffs, also not elected. Voters could vote for a member of House of Burgess.
As cash crop producers, Chesapeake plantations were heavily dependent on trade.  With easy navigation by river, few towns and no cities developed; planters shipped directly to Britain. High death rates and a very young population profile characterized the colony during its first decades.

Lower South
The colonial South included the plantation colonies of the Chesapeake region (Virginia and Maryland) and the lower South (Carolina, which eventually split into North and South Carolina, and Georgia).

Carolinas
The first attempted English settlement south of Virginia was the Province of Carolina.  It was a private venture, financed by a group of English businessmen calling themselves the ""Lords Proprietors,"" who obtained a Royal Charter to the Carolinas in 1663, hoping that a new colony in the south would become profitable like that of Jamestown.  Carolina was not settled until 1670, and even then the first attempt failed because there was no incentive for emigration to the south.  However, eventually the Lords combined their remaining capital and financed a settlement mission to the area led by John West. The expedition located fertile and defensible ground at what was to become Charleston (originally Charles Town for King Charles II,  thus beginning the English colonization of the mainland. The original settlers in South Carolina established a lucrative trade in provisions, deerskins and Indian captives with the Caribbean islands. They came mainly from the English colony of Barbados and brought African slaves with them.  Barbados, as a wealthy sugarcane plantation island, was one of the early English colonies to large numbers of Africans in plantation style agriculture.  The cultivation of rice was introduced during the 1690s via Africans from the rice-growing regions of West Africa. North Carolina remained a frontier through the early colonial period.
At first, South Carolina was politically divided. Its ethnic makeup included the original settlers, a group of rich, slave-owning English settlers from the island of Barbados; and Huguenots, a French-speaking community of Protestants. Nearly continuous frontier warfare during the era of King William's War and Queen Anne's War drove economic and political wedges between merchants and planters. The disaster of the Yamasee War, in 1715, set off a decade of political turmoil. By 1729, the proprietary government had collapsed, and the Proprietors sold both colonies back to the British crown.

Georgia
James Oglethorpe, an 18th century British Member of Parliament, established Georgia as a common solution to two problems.  British feared that Spanish Florida was threatening the British Carolinas.  Oglethorpe established his colony in the contested border region of Georgia and populated it with the poor and debtors who would otherwise have been imprisoned.  This plan would both rid Britain of its undesirable elements and provide her with a base from which to attack Florida.  The first colonists arrived in 1733.
Oglethorpe established his colony on strict moralistic principles.  Slavery was forbidden, as was alcohol.  The colonists rejected any puritanical lifestyle and complained that their colony could not compete economically with the Carolina rice plantations. Georgia initially failed to prosper, but in 1752 the trustees turned over control of the colony to the royal government and the restrictions were lifted, slavery was allowed, and it became moderately prosperous.

Plantations
By the 1720s, a sew aspiring planters began to construct large Georgian-style mansions, wear bright red attire, and hunt deer from horseback. Wealthy women in the Southern colonies shared in the British culture and spent large sums on the latest fasions and furniture. 
The wives of the plantation owners supervised the household slaves, handled medical services for all the slaves, and put on elaborate dinners and festive balls. These efforts were the most successful in South Carolina, where wealthy rice planters lived in townhouses in Charleston, a busy port city. Active social seasons flourished in the few towns, such as Annapolis, Maryland, and on tobacco plantations in Virginia.

Slaves
The African slaves who worked on the indigo, tobacco, and rice fields in the South came mostly from the Caribbean sugar islands (plus a few who came directly from Africa). In 1700, there were about 9,600 slaves in the Chesapeake region and a few hundred in the Carolinas. About 170,000 more Africans arrived over the next five decades. By 1750, there were more than 250,000 slaves in British America; in South Carolina they made up about 60% of the total population. Very favorable food and health standards contributed to rapid population growth.

Economy

The great majority of people throughout the colonial era were farmers and their income was not cash but the value of the crops and animals produced on farms, and mostly consumed by the family. The estimates are based on inventories of estates when people died. Most people lived in poverty—with very few possessions such as a small stock of clothes, a shack to live in, a few household goods—and land and animals. In terms of wealth the per capita wealth of Americans in 1774 was £37.4 ($6700 in 2009 dollars); per adult male £172 ($30,700); and per white adult male £218 ($39,000).[1]

Literature
Colonial American literature is perhaps the most vibrant field in American literary studies today. In the last decade an explosion of anthologies designed to make widely available a broad range of non-canonical writings produced in and about Great Britain's colonies in the Western hemisphere has provided teachers and scholars with important new tools. The explosion has been driven partly by the identity-based recuperation movements of the 1970s and 1980s, partly by a new awareness of the importance of texts circulated in manuscript or newspapers rather than in book form, and partly by dissatisfaction with the predominant Puritan origins narrative and a swelling interest in transnationalism. New anthologies include Myra Jehlen and Michael Warner's The English Literatures of America, 1580–1800 (Routledge, 1996), Vincent Carretta's Unchained Voices: An Anthology of Black Authors in the English-Speaking World of the Eighteenth Century (Lexington, Ky., 1996), Sharon M. Harris's Early American Women Writers to 1800 (Oxford, 1996), and Thomas W. Krise's Caribbeana: An Anthology of English Literature of the West Indies, 1657–1777 (Chicago, 1999), Susan Castillo and Ivy Schweitzer, The Literatures of Colonial America: An Anthology (Oxford, 2001) Carla Muford's Early American Writings (Oxford 2002), and Susan Castillo's, Colonial Encounters in New World Writing, 1500–1786: Performing America (Routledge, 2006). Add in the University of Massachusetts Press series on native writers and scholars have made readily available a vast array of once obscure English-language works. Some of these new volumes represent an effort by colonialists to catch up to the rest of the field of Americanist scholarship, providing the pre-literary history to contemporary Caribbean or African American literature. In an important sense, however, colonialists occupy a unique position among Americanists. At a moment when many scholars are rejecting nationalist narratives of literary history, which they view as the intellectual equivalent of isolationism in a world increasingly committed to globalization, students of colonial American literature rightly claim a pre-national vantage point. A transnational approach to colonial literature has the attractive features of being both intellectually sound and trendy.[2]

Unification of the 13 colonies
A common defense
One event that reminded colonists of their shared identity as British subjects was the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-1748) in Europe.  This conflict spilled over into the colonies, where it was known as ""King George's War""; most of the fighting took place in Europe, British colonial troops attacked French Canada.
At the Albany Congress of 1754, Benjamin Franklin proposed that the colonies be united by a Grand Council overseeing a common policy for defense, expansion, and Indian affairs.  While the plan was thwarted by colonial legislatures and King George II, it was an early indication that the British colonies of North America were headed towards unification.  Franklin did not give up; more than anyone, he invented the idea of a United States of America.

Great Awakening
For a more detailed treatment, see First Great Awakening.
One event that began to unify the religious background of the colonies was the First Great Awakening, a Protestant revival movement that took place in the 1730s and 1740s. It began with Jonathan Edwards, a Massachusetts preacher who sought to return to the Pilgrims' strict Calvinist roots and to reawaken the ""Fear of God"".  Edwards was a powerful speaker and attracted a large following with sermons such as ""Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God"".  English preacher George Whitefield and other itinerant preachers continued the movement, traveling across the colonies and preaching in a dramatic and emotional style.
Followers of Edwards and other preachers of similar religiosity called themselves the ""New Lights,"" as contrasted with the ""Old Lights"", who disapproved of their movement.  To promote their viewpoints, the two sides established academies and colleges including Princeton and Williams College.  The Great Awakening has been called the first truly ""American"" event, and as such represented at least a small step towards the unification of the colonies.
A similar pietistic movement took place among some of the German and Dutch Lutherans, leading to internal dvisions. By the 1770s the Baptists were growing rapidly both in the north (where they founded Brown University, and in the South where they challenged the previously unquestioned moral authority of the Anglican establishment.

French and Indian War
File:WashingtonFIwar.jpg George Washington during the French and Indian War
For a more detailed treatment, see French and Indian War.
The French and Indian War (1754-1763) was the American extension of the general European conflict known as the Seven Years' War.
The war is called the French and Indian because the Iroquois confederacy—which had been playing the British and the French against each other successfully for decades fought on both sides. The French were defeated and in the Treaty of Paris (1763), France surrendered its vast North American empire to Britain.
The French and Indian war took on a new significance for the North American colonists in Great Britain when William Pitt the elder decided that it was necessary to win the war against France at all costs. For the first time, North America was one of the main theatres of what could be termed a ""world war"".  During the war, the status of all the British Colonies (including the thirteen colonies) as part of the British Empire was made truly apparent, as British military and civilian officials took on an increased presence in the lives of Americans. The war also increased a sense of American unity in other ways. It caused men, who might normally have never left their colonies, to travel across the continent, fighting alongside men from decidedly different, yet still ""American,"" backgrounds. Throughout the course of the war, British officers trained American ones (most notably George Washington) for battle which would later benefit the American Revolution. Also, state legislatures and officials had to cooperate intensively, for arguably the first time, in pursuit of the continent-wide military effort.
The British and colonists triumphed jointly over a common foe.  The colonists' loyalty to the mother country was stronger than ever before.  The war produced prosperity, as royal officials hired American troops and sent in well paid British troops. The French were defeated, and the British took Canada. Most important, the military threat from any foreign power ended, and the colonies no longer needed the protection of the Royal Navy. The British army handled Indian affairs on the frontier, so Indians were no longer a major threat to the Americans.


Ties to the British Empire
Although the colonies were very different from one another, they were still a part of the British Empire and each looked to London for leadership. military protection, and trade. 
The political institutions of the colonies were originally patterned after English models, but by the 1760s there was a very different tone. Americans ignored the Royal Court and paid attention to the ""country"" party in Britain which was opposed to the Court; this was the origin of republicanism which increasingly dominated American political values. 
The codes of law of the colonies were drawn directly from English common law, which was carefully studied by the hundreds of lawyers in the colonies.[3] Eventually, it was a dispute over the meaning of the English Constitution and the rights of Englishmen that animated a new generation after 1760 to demand respect for their historic rights as Englishmen. 
Another point on which the colonies found themselves more similar than different was the booming import of British goods by international merchants based in American seaports.  Socially, the colonial elite imitated British styles of luxurious consumption, dress, dance, and etiquette.  This social upper echelon built its mansions in the Georgian style (named after King George), copied the furniture designs of Thomas Chippendale, and participated in the intellectual currents of Europe, such as Enlightenment.  To many of their inhabitants, the seaport cities of colonial America were truly British cities. The British economy had begun to grow rapidly at the end of the 17th century, and by the mid-18th century, small factories in Britain were producing much more than the nation could consume.  Finding a market for their goods in the British colonies of North America, Britain increased her exports to that region by 360% between 1740 and 1770.  Because British merchants offered generous credit to their customers, Americans began buying staggering amounts of English goods. Economic integration across the Atlantic was more and more a reality, as the economy of each colony matured and was more involved in oceanic trade.

From unity to revolution
Royal Proclamation
The general sentiment of inequity that arose soon after the Treaty of Paris of 1763 was solidified by the Proclamation of 1763, which temporarily prohibited settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains. Colonists resented the measure, and it was never enforced.

Acts of Parliament
Parliament had generally been preoccupied with affairs in Europe and let the colonies govern themselves. It was no longer willing to do so.  A series of measures resulting from this policy change, while affecting the New England colonies most directly would continue to arouse opposition in the 'thirteen colonies' over the next thirteen years, leading to the American Revolution: 

Sugar Act (1764)
Stamp Act of 1765
 First Quartering Act (1765)
Declaratory Act (1766)
Townshend Acts (1767)
Tea Act (1773)
 The Intolerable Acts, also called the Coercive or Punitive Acts
 Second Quartering Act (1774)
Quebec Act (1774)
Massachusetts Government Act (1774)
Administration of Justice Act (1774)
Boston Port Act (1774)

16th Amendment,https://www.conservapedia.com/16th_Amendment," Ratification page for the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (1913)
The Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution allows the Congress to ""lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived"".
Far-reaching in its social as well as its economic impact, the income tax amendment became part of the Constitution by a curious series of events culminating in a bit of political maneuvering that went awry.

Background
Civil War
The financial requirements of the American Civil War prompted the first American income tax in 1861. At first, Congress placed a flat 3-percent tax on all incomes over $800 and later modified this principle to include a graduated tax. Congress repealed the income tax in 1872, but the concept did not disappear.

Post Civil War
After the Civil War, the growing industrial and financial markets of the eastern United States generally prospered. But the farmers of the south and west suffered from low prices for their farm products, while they were forced to pay high prices for manufactured goods. Throughout the 1860s, 1870s, and 1880s, farmers formed such political organizations as the Grange, the Greenback Party, the National Farmers’ Alliance, and the People’s (Populist) Party. All of these groups advocated many reforms (see the Interstate Commerce Act) considered radical for the times, including a graduated income tax. 

Progressive Era
In 1894, as part of the Wilson-Gorman tariff bill, Congress enacted a 2-percent tax on income over $4,000. The tax in 1895 was struck down by a five-to-four decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. It held unconstitutional any direct tax by Congress on income.  A tax on income derived from property was a direct tax which Congress could impose only by the rule of apportionment according to population pursuant to Article I, Secs. 2 and 9 of the Constitution.  The Pollock decision was a surprise because merely 15 years earlier the Supreme Court had unanimously upheld a similar tax during the Civil War, the only other time that Congress had tried to tax income directly.
Although radicals denounced the Court’s decision as a prime example of the alliance of government and business against the farmer, a general return of prosperity around the turn of the century softened the demand for reform. Democratic Party Platforms under the leadership of three-time Presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan, however, consistently included an income tax plank, and the progressive wing of the Republican Party also espoused the concept.
After Pollock, the Court did uphold creative taxation by Congress based on a theory that they were levied on mere ""incidents of ownership"" and thus were constitutional excise taxes:  (1) an inheritance tax, (2) a tax affixing revenue stamps to memoranda for the sale of merchandise on commodity exchanges, (3) a war revenue tax upon tobacco being resold, and (4) a corporate income tax as an excise ""measured by income"" justified by the privilege of doing business in corporate form.

Comeback
The income tax, long a dream of progressives, was put on the back burner until a later date and more opportune time to try again.  As a few years went by, the popularity of taxing income gradually increased once more, and even was included as a topic in the 1907 State of the Union address of then president Theodore Roosevelt.[1]

Passage
In 1909 progressives in Congress, led by Republican Senator Nelson Aldrich, Republican of Rhode Island, proposed a constitutional amendment allowing an income tax.  President William Howard Taft gave an important speech in support of the effort on June 16, 1909.[2]  Shortly thereafter, a resolution proposing the 16th amendment was submitted on July 12, 1909.[3] The amendment was ratified by one state legislature after another, and on February 25, 1913, with the certification by Secretary of State Philander C. Knox, the 16th amendment took effect. The first income tax was passed in 1913 as part of the Underwood Tariff. Since the new tariff was lower, the government needed a way to replace the lost revenue. Due to generous exemptions and deductions, less than 1 percent of the population paid income taxes at the rate of only 1 percent of net income. However, during World War I the heavy cost of the war led to much higher rates; the rates were lowered in the 1920s.
The Sixteenth Amendment settled the constitutional question of permission to tax income and, by so doing, effected dramatic changes in the American way of life.  The states which ratified the amendment are as follows:[4]

 Utah, March 9, 1911
The remaining states ratified this amendment, after the necessary number was reached:  Vermont, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and West Virginia.

Repeal efforts
On April 13, 2000, an organization called We the People Foundation for Constitutional Education, Inc. sent delegates to Washington D.C. to argue that the 16th Amendment was not properly ratified. There are a number of questionable circumstances surrounding the ratification, including evidence that states which were claimed to have ratified it actually rejected it.

2008 financial crisis,https://www.conservapedia.com/2008_financial_crisis,"The Financial Crisis of 2008 was a global financial crisis that is the worst the world has seen since 1933 with the Great Depression. Drastic measures to confront seemingly insurmountable financial calamity resulted in the creation of TARP (Troubled Assets Relief Program), $700 billion safety net appropriated by the U.S. Congress.  The National Bureau of Economic Research[1] has identified the peak of the last boom cycle in December 2007; the U.S. economy has been in decline ever since.[2]  Oct 11, 2008 editorial; cartoon by Horsey stresses the global collapse  The crisis has caused the Recession of 2008, which reached bottom in summer 2009, causing a worldwide economic decline that is the most severe since the 1930s. As of 2013, there are still 4 million fewer jobs in the U.S. than in 2008 - despite $5 trillion in federal stimulus spending.   
Some free market advocates believe Congress and the Federal Reserve should not have bailed out failing firms and instead should have allowed market mechanism to operate.[3][4]  A 2005 study found that government corporate bailouts are often done  more for political considerations, and the economic resources allocated exhibit significantly worse  performance than resources allocated using practical considerations [5]
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) calculated that the global financial crisis would produce $3.4 trillion in losses for financial institutions around the world by 2010.[6] World GDP in 2007 was approximately $70 trillion, so the immediate decline in the economic output of the planet was about 5%.

Overview
Negative economic news spread outward from financial institutions connected to Fannie Mae and the real estate boom to depress housing sales, construction, commercial real estate, automobiles, retail sales, state and local government, and virtually every other sector of the economy. Consumer confidence and spending plunged. Major banks and corporations went bankrupt. 
The recession was worldwide.  Initially governments across the world borrowed and spent huge sums of money to reverse the crisis, but the results were anaemic and the decline continued. By 2013, the notion of a Keynesian stimulus had been abandoned by the European Union, which cut it's budget in real terms, and the United States which invoked a sequestration of federal mandated spending to reduce the baseline for future years. While the prospect of deflation ordinarily would be real, the Federal Reserve had vastly increased the money supply both domestically and abroad with lending to foreign Central banks. Although the U.S. monetary base aggregates were four times larger than in mid 2007, federal spending was 50% more than in 2008, and  the accumulated national debt one-third greater, U.S. GDP output still lagged and the workforce was the size (134 million workers) as it was in 2003 - despite population having grown by 24 million people.  The U.S. government provided cash bailouts of several hundred billion dollars and long-term loan guarantees of over $7 trillion (compared to a GDP of $14.6 trillion in 2008).  
Unlike crises in the mid 1970s and early 1980s, the panic began in the financial and real estate sector with devastating effects on many very large financial companies worldwide, especially in September 2008.  The negative effects by October 2008 began spreading to all other sectors of the economy, and forecasts for the next several years showed little likelihood of recovery anywhere. For the effects on the broader economy (outside of finance and autos) see Recession of 2008.
The crisis originated with government-backed home loan guarantees in the United States, and has impacted every country in the world. Banks and financial companies reported losses of over one trillion dollars; investors suffered ""paper losses"" of many trillions. U.S. stocks went down 50% from their peak in 2007.[7] Paper losses for owners of stock in major financial institution were over 70%, and owners of some have lost 99% as major banks closed down. The stock market declined 50-70% in major countries and pension funds have large paper losses.  Paper losses in real estate have been in the trillions; the average price of American houses fell 20%, with 30% and higher declines in California and Florida.  However, thus far ordinary depositors with cash in the bank have suffered no losses. Owners of stocks in the 5000 largest U.S. corporations have paper losses of $10 trillion in 2008, dropping to $10 trillion in October from $20 trillion in late 2007. 

Liquidity crisis
In late September the crisis focused on liquidity—financial companies owned hundreds of billions of dollars of ""toxic"" real estate assets, mostly based on U.S. Fannie Mae-backed mortgages; they could not sell the toxic securities because no one knew how much they were worth, and large scale loans between major institutions stopped flowing as the system lost liquidity and froze up. A $800 billion rescue plan became law in the U.S. October 3. Meanwhile, Europe's sovereign debt crisis continued to deteriorate, as trillions of dollars in losses accumulated there and in many other countries.  International agencies such as the International Monetary Fund are giving guidance for medium-sized countries, like Pakistan and Ukraine.  In the panic, people around the world sent their money to the U.S. and Japan because the banks there are more tightly regulated and considered safer than their own banks.  The price of oil, which reached $145 a barrel in the summer, plunged to under $50. That plunge eased pump prices, helped commuters, and the airline industry.

Both parties have expressed anger at the crisis, and have promised extensive new regulations of the financial industry. The Republicans opposed additional bailout aid to General Motors, which was on the verge of bankruptcy.[8] Democratic Congressional leaders and President Barack Obama had the United States Treasury take control of General Motors while paying existing shareholders 22 cents on the dollar for their investment and claims, and not demanding any meaningful concessions from the labor unions to bring wages more in line with a competitive world standard.
The Bush administration undertook a program in which it took control of several of the largest financial institutions and government sponsored entities (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and AIG insurance) at the heart of the crisis, forced mergers of others, purchased $125 billion of ownership in the 9 largest banks in the U.S., and provided relief to the largest bank, Citigroup.
Until October the crisis had little impact on the non-financial sectors of the world economy, but then negative impacts started appearing.  Companies could not borrow money for expansion or in some cases for routine operations, and had to cut back. Consumer spending fell and unemployment rose sharply.  By Election day in November pessimistic reports were coming in daily from practically every sector of the  American economy. There were no bright spots, and with tax revenues down, state governments began large-scale cutbacks, especially in New York and California.
By late October it appeared the financial crisis was causing a slowdown of all the economies of  the world, and a serious recession with widespread unemployment and business failures The Federal Reserve took aggressive steps to dissolve the liquidity freeze and to allow lending to flow again.

Causes
As hundreds of billions of dollars poured into the U.S. from abroad, financiers looked for imaginative ways to make a profit. They turned to real estate, with the philosophy ""Buy high--sell higher!""  The higher price paid for a house the more profit would be made when it was resold (""flipped"") in six or 12 months; prices were certain to keep going up and up. Salesmen made big money by phoning prospective buyers, promising to get them Bog Money Quick.  People who owned a house whose value had doubled could and did refinance their mortgage for the higher amount, and keep the difference.  In the early 2000s, U.S. interest rates were low and demand for housing was high, as housing prices soared, especially in California, Florida, Nevada and Arizona. Mortgage companies and banks were very eager to lend, especially to people with mediocre credit who would not previously have been eligible for mortgages and to speculators. Speculators were ordinary people who already had a house and who were hoping to make a large profit on the purchase and quick resale (""flip"") of another house or condominium, which no one ever lived in.[9]  The expectation was that continuously rising house prices would cover the mortgage payments through refinancing. Many of the mortgages involved very low down payments and low monthly payments for the first year or two, after which the payments would start soaring. Sometimes the monthly payment at first was zero. 
Both the Bush and Clinton administrations made it a national priority to encourage more people to buy houses, assuming this social engineering would be good for everyone. In 2000 Howard Husock warned that the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 and its expansion in 1995 would prove expensive; but President Bush strongly endorsed the program. Despite widespread misunderstanding they did not cause the great crisis since CRA loans to poor neighborhoods comprised only about 6% of the toxic mortgages.[10]
""Option adjustable rate mortgages"" (nicknamed ""Pick-A-Pay"") allowed borrowers to vary their monthly payments; they could be so so small they did not cover their interest charges. That meant the total principal grows over time, compared to normal mortgages where the debt owed shrinks over 30 years to zero and the borrower owns the house free and clear. By 2008 banks sold these dangerous ""option adjustable rate"" mortgages to two million customers.  They made sense if and only if the price of houses kept going up and the borrower could sell it in a year ot two at a huge profit. But if house prices declined, the borrower could stop paying and the bank was left with the loss.

The NYTimes says Senator Charles Schumer D-NY, is the most responsible for Wall Street's collapse.[11] Schumer as a member of the Banking and Finance Committees, led efforts to regulate credit-rating agencies, shield financial institutions from government oversight and tougher regulations, and saved key industry players billions of dollars in taxes and fees.

Selling Fannie Mae-backed mortgage bundles to pension funds and institutional investors
Americans owed some $10 trillion on their mortgages, most of which were sound with payments made on time. However financiers bundled the mortgages into very complicated packages called ""collateralized debt obligations'[12] or CDOs. Hundreds of billions of dollars worth of CDO's were sold to banks, pension funds and financiers in the U.S. and Europe. Generally they borrowed cash to buy the CDOs.  The risk was that if the CDO's declined in value, they would not be able to repay those loans.  The CDOs were especially attractive because they were not regulated by the government; experts are not sure how many trillions of dollars are involved.
Many mortgages were held or originated by mortgage companies like Countrywide and Washington Mutual, as well as investment banks such as Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, as well as commercial banking chains like Wachovia and Bank of America, which have thousands of local offices.

Commercial real estate
The speculative real-estate bubble went far beyond residential homes, it infected as well all kinds of commercial real estate,[13] such as office buildings, shopping centers, apartment complexes, hotels, casinos and even empty lots. People bought high expecting to  sell higher, and were stunned when the market collapsed. People who loaned money to real estate firms were confident of a 20% return, but more likely lost 25%. The value of office buildings plunged 43% after the peak in Nov. 2007.  Most investors who bought in 2007 probably lost all their investment.
For example, in 2006 at the top of the market Tishman Speyer Properties and BlackRock Realty invested $5.4 billion to buy the largest apartment complex in the United States, in downtown New York City. Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, with 110 buildings and 11,227 apartments housing median income families. The plan was to spend billions in upgrades, and as tenants moved out, to raise the rents.  The expectation proved wildly overoptimistic, and the monthly rents collected did not cover the debt payments. In January 2010 Tishman Speyer and BlackRock turned over the property to creditors, taking a 100% loss.[14]

Misuse of Credit Default Swaps
Another key contributing factor to the credit market meltdown was the misuse of Credit Default Swaps, or CDSs, which are contracts between entities designed to mitigate against risk of a credit default.  A CDS is essentially an insurance policy[15] designed to protect the insured party against excessive losses in a separate financial transaction.  However, by structuring the contract as a derivative swap instead of a traditional insurance policy, companies other than regulated insurers[16] could offer them.  This created two critical risk exposures to the insured companies, and collectively to the overall market.  First, traditional insurers are required to maintain a sufficient level of capital reserves to pay on losses, while companies issuing CDSs were not.  Since investments in pooled mortgages were viewed as unlikely to devalue or fail, major issuers of CDSs like AIG and Lehman Brothers found themselves over-exposed to losses.  The second risk was that CDSs issued by one firm were typically hedged, or backed up financially, by CDSs with other companies.  The strategy of minimizing risk by dividing it into collections of smaller exposures with other companies is a sound practice, but when the original risk is overexposed that overexposure is then spread across the companies that participate in the secondary risk markets.  
AIG, the world's largest insurance company, was a major player in the financial crisis because it sold $441 billion in unhedged and undercapitalized insurance on securitized debt, much of it tied to mortgage values.  Normally an insurance company ""lays off"" some of the risk by taking out insurance with another company.  AIG neglected to do this because it never expected the securities to turn toxic,[17] which they did.  Either someone paid the insurance or the nation's financial system would colapse, so the government stepped in, seized AIG, and paid the insurance.  
The effect of these risks manifested themselves in two key ways.  First, when major players in the CDS market like Bear Sterns and AIG were found to be insolvent, or failed outright like Lehman Brothers, the default conditions that were tied to the risk-spreading CDS's were triggered, and many companies found themselves obligated to pay out on contracts they never expected to.  These sudden exposures led to capital and liquidity shortages at scores of firms involved in the secondary credit markets, and the default pattern started repeating on itself in an echo-like manner.  Since the complex, interdependent nature of the CDS market made it difficult for firms to assess their true exposure to loss in this unprecedented market, they refrained from both short-term and long-term lending to guard against further losses.  This essentially led to a freezing up of credit in the marketplace, as lenders refusing to give credit to other lenders translated into businesses and consumers being unable to get short-term operating loans to meet payroll, or borrow for homes, autos, student loans, or credit-card accounts as before.  
This freezing of the markets to avoid loss was the primary incentive for the U.S. government's Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which injected billions of dollars of government-backed funds into the credit markets to restore confidence and liquidity.

Bubble bursts
The housing ""bubble"" burst in 2006-07, as prices plunged downward in the Sunbelt. Many speculators and homeowners could not meet their payments, especially those who had ""sub-prime"" mortgages because their income was too low to support the eventual monthly payments, or who had adjustable rate mortgages where the monthly payments started small then escalated.   Foreclosures skyrocketed. With housing prices falling few people risked buying a new house (because it would soon be worth less than they paid for it). Construction firms had built millions of new houses that could not be sold but which glutted the market.  By late 2008 half the home sales in the U.S. were by banks selling houses they had foreclosed on at low prices. 
The problem was that no one could figure out what CDOs were now worth, so very few were willing to buy them.  One major investment bank, Merrill Lynch, sold its CDOs for 22 cents on the dollar—a ""fire sale"" price that was less than they were worth in the long run, because in the long run the great majority of people will make their scheduled mortgage payments.

2008 crises
Multiple crises started pulling down major financial players.  Countrywide, which originated 20% of all American mortgages in 2006, collapsed and was bought up by Bank of America.  Bear Stearns, a large investment bank, went under; the government arranged a sale to JPMorgan Chase; stock holders lost about 90% of their investment, and the confidence in other banks was undermined.
On September 7, 2008, the government took control of the two largest mortgage holders, ""Fannie Mae""[18] and ""Freddie Mac.""[19] The two had lost $15 billion on the $5.4 trillion in mortgages they owned, and their notes were widely held in China and many other countries.  The fear was that if the Treasury did not act the world's confidence in the US financial system would collapse.  However the rest of the world was in trouble too.  The stock markets in China and Russia plunged 50%, and the British Treasury had to take over its largest mortgage company, Northern Rock.  Vast sums of money flowed into the US because it was safer there than anywhere else.

 Panic in Wall Street, Sept. 2008; the ""bull"" is the symbol of optimism on Wall Street and the ""bear"" is the symbol of pessimism.  Here the bull panics.
By September the major banks were no longer lending money and most reported huge losses as they wrote down the value of the CDOs and other assets. Short sellers sold large amounts of stock in threatened companies, causing further panic and driving down share prices.[20] Lehman Brothers, one of the oldest and largest banks in New York, went bankrupt on Sept. 15 with no one to rescue it.  The collapse of Lehman with its $639 billion in assets had a multiplier effect worldwide, severely weakening other big banks and sharply increasing the level of fear and distrust inside the system that caused bankers to sharply reduce their lending.  Many large firms and hedge funds had borrowed billions of dollars from lenders and had pledged assets they owned as collateral. When the value of their collateral plummeted, the lenders demanded more collateral to make up the difference, so the borrowers had to sell assets to raise emergency cash.  The price of the assets they sold was falling, and large additional sales further depressed prices, creating a downward spiral. 
Merrill Lynch was sold to Bank of America for $50 billion, about half its value a few months before. Investors realized that AIG could no longer honor the insurance policies it wrote. It lost $13 billion in the first half of 2008 and its shares fell 95% in value. AIG was ""too big"" to be allowed to fail, so it was given an $85 billion loan from the government; in return the government received 80% of its stock. The government had to add another $38 billion to the AIG rescue in October.[21]  In effect AIG, along with GSE (government-sponsored enterprises) Fanny Mae and Freddy Mac were nationalized.  The Federal Reserve, with $800 billion in assets, was assisted by the Treasury, which gave it more funds.[22]

European crises
Heavy borrowing by European banks meant the crisis immediately affected Britain and other countries as well, as the British housing bubble burst about the same time as the U.S. The British government had to take over major mortgage lenders, including Northern Rock in February, 2008.  Northern Rock's loans (£25 billion) and guarantees (£30 billion) extended by the Bank of England, together with the value of the company's mortgages (£55 billion), or £100 billion in all, were added to the British national debt.  Bradford & Bingley, half the size of Northern Rock, held £40 billion in toxic mortgages, and was nationalized in late September. 

Fortis
In late September, the Fortis bank, the world's 20th largest business, was partially nationalized by three governments who injected $16 billion in emergency funds. In 2007 Fortis borrowed heavily for its $100 billion takeover of rival bank ABN Amro; the deal came at the market's peak, and Fortis now cannot pay its debts. The Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments tried to inject capital but as consumer confidence plunged, Netherlands nationalized the Dutch wing of the company and the rest was sold in early October to the French bank BNP Paribas for €14.5 billion euros ($19 billion). 

Germany
In Germany Hypo Real Estate was given €50 billion euros ($68 billion) bailout by the government.  The government of Iceland took over its large banks, as the entire island economy verged on bankruptcy because it depended so much on large foreign loans. Most of the European countries hurriedly announced guarantees of personal bank deposits to avert further drop in consumer confidence and runs on the banks.  Stock markets around the world continue to decline as pessimism worsens.

Central banks
The European Central Bank aggressively lent money to banks trying to ensure that banks would have adequate cash. The moves have not reassured savers or investors, and European stock markets have fallen even further than the American stock markets, as have the stock markets in China and Russia.  
On October 13, France, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and Austria committed €1.3 trillion euros ($1.8 trillion) to guarantee bank loans and take stakes in banks, in an emergency effort to head off the collapse of their financial systems.[23]

Britain
Britain on October 8 announced a gigantic £400 billion ($680 billion) rescue plan for its banks; the government would partially own them.  Prime Minister Gordon Brown said banks would still be run by their old managers, but that the government would have to be ""satisfied"" on matters of salaries, dividends and lending activities.  The money involved is about a third of Britain's annual GDP (comparable to $5 trillion in the U.S. economy.)
On October 13, Britain announced it would spend £50 billion ($85 billion) to nationalize two of the five largest banks, HBOS (Halifax Bank of Scotland) and RBS (Royal Bank of Scotland), while taking partial ownership of a third, Lloyds TSB. A fourth, Barclays will remain private if it can raise an additional £7 billion. The fifth, HSBC is based in Hong Kong and will remain private.[24]

Switzerland
In October 2008, the Swiss central bank and the big UBS bank reached an agreement to transfer as much as $60 billion of troubled securities and other assets from UBS's to a separate entity. UBS will put up $6 billion in equity. The Swiss central bank will control the new entity and loan it $54 billion.

Asia
The crisis swept across the Middle East and Asia as well, with South Korea especially hard hit.  China, which had been the world's major growth machine in recent years, seemed to slow down. In November China's government announced it would spend 4 trillion yuan ($586 billion) through the end of 2010 to stimulate its economy. It specifically targeted people's livelihood in an effort to offset the impact of slowing global demand for its exports and unlock the spending power of its vast population.

Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)
""We're in the midst of a serious financial crisis,"" President Bush warned the nation on Sept. 25, 2008.:

Major financial institutions have teetered on the edge of collapse, and some have failed. As uncertainty has grown, many banks have restricted lending. Credit markets have frozen. And families and businesses have found it harder to borrow money....without immediate action by Congress, America could slip into a financial panic, and a distressing scenario would unfold: More banks could fail, including some in your community. The stock market would drop even more, which would reduce the value of your retirement account. The value of your home could plummet. Foreclosures would rise dramatically. And if you own a business or a farm, you would find it harder and more expensive to get credit. More businesses would close their doors, and millions of Americans could lose their jobs. Even if you have good credit history, it would be more difficult for you to get the loans you need to buy a car or send your children to college. And ultimately, our country could experience a long and painful recession.[25]
On September 19, 2008, the Treasury and Federal Reserve proposed a major rescue plan—the largest government intervention in the economy since World War II. The plan was for the Treasury to purchase $700 billion of the CDOs. The buyout was needed, Bush said, to avert a major disaster for the economy.  Most (but not all) Democrats signed on to the plan, adding provisions for Congressional oversight and caps on CEO compensation; but at the last moment on Sept 25, 2008 House Republicans said no, and GOP presidential nominee John McCain held off endorsement.  
Conservatives were split on what to do.  Many agreed with Bush that the program proposed by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson was urgently needed. Large banks and corporations strongly endorsed the it.  The American Bankers Association and the Mortgage Bankers Association are fighting against any amendment that would reduce mortgage obligations for people in bankruptcy, while directing all the government funds to the banking industry.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, normally an outspoken advocate of big corporate interests, instead stressed the crisis's impact on small and midsize businesses. ""We're looking at an economy that was slipping toward recession even before this crisis culminated in a market lockup last week,"" said Chamber economist Martin Regalia. The debate in Congress, he said, ""is costing every American taxpayer money, directly.""[26]  Democratic nominee Senator Barack Obama endorsed the plan, as amended by Congressional Democrats. On the other hand, ordinary taxpayers and ""Main Street,"" that is businessmen who operated at the local level, were highly suspicious of Wall Street. McCain, blaming the crisis on ""the corruption and manipulation of our home mortgage system,"" rejected the bailout as a favor for Wall Street and little help to Main Street. Advocates of the market economy insisted that the market should run its course, and opposed the government intervention.[27]  The fiscally irresponsible TARP program increased the national debt by $300 million in 2009.[28]
A compromise was agreed to by leaders of both parties but the ""Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008"" (EESA)  was voted down in the House on Sept. 29.   Democrats favored the Bush bill 60%-40%, but Republicans voted no by  65-35%. The stock market lost a trillion dollars in value in one day as uncertainty reigned.  Finally a large majority passed a more expensive bill, that added $100 billion in new subsidies to the original $700 billion, plus tax breaks and a rise in FDIC insurance to $250,000 from $100,000, intended to reassure ordinary depositors. Both Obama and McCain voted for this version of the bill. 
The Treasury TARP program proved erratic and had to be radically modified several times. The Treasury dropped the original plan to buy toxic securities and instead has used $250 billion to prop up major banks. In October Paulson and Bernanke used their new powers to take an ownership stake in the nine largest U.S. banks, of $7 to $25 billion each. These banks are now partly owned and controlled by the government. However those banks are keeping the money and not lending it out. The price of bank stocks has fallen sharply since the relief program was passed. The world's largest bank, Citigroup, was on the verge of collapse in late November and received a second loan of $20 billion (in addition to $25 billion in October), and a federal guarantee to cover most of its toxic investments.
In mid-December Bush announced that $17.4 billion of TARP funds would be given to the automobile industry in the form of bridge loans,[29] just enough to prevent the companies from going bankrupt for a few weeks.[30] Bush defended the move by saying ""if we were to allow the free market to take its course now, it would almost certainly lead to disorderly bankruptcy and liquidation for the automakers.""[29]
By mid-November the market had lost confidence in Treasury Secretary Paulson, who indicated he was baffled and would let the incoming Obama administration handle the unspent $450 billion.  The stock market jumped 6% on the news that Obama had picked New York banker Timothy Geithner to replace Paulson.[31]  In late November the Federal Reserve announced it will buy up to $600 billion in mortgage-related assets from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, hoping to restart the housing and credit markets.  Under the new ""Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility,"" or TALF, the Federal Reserve will loan up to $200 billion to financial companies that hold securities backed by consumer and small-business loans. 
Hedge funds are private investment companies with a combined $1.7 trillion in assets. They have lost $180 billion since July and some are near collapse. Investors are demanding their money back, and Wall Street in late October is bracing for a shake-out in the industry.[32]
In late November the government announced an $800 billion plan to boost consumer credit and the market for mortgage-related securities. Plans call for the Federal Reserve in early 2009 to extend up to $200 billion in non-recourse loans to holders of asset-backed securities backed by highly rated consumer and small business loans.[33] Treasury will contribute $20 billion in funds through its Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The Federal Reserve also announced it will purchase up to $100 billion in GSE (government-sponsored enterprises, especially Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac) debt through a series of competitive auctions starting in December, 2008. The Federal Reserve starting in December will purchase up to $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities backed by GSEs such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the Fed is preparing to launch new liquidity programs to support the economy in addition to further slashing interests rates.  The total commitments by the government in relief and loan guarantees exceeded $7 trillion, but the economy nevertheless continued to slip downward.[34]

Deepening recession
By early December the entire economy was heading downward with no bright spots. The recession that began in Dec. 2007 intensified, as retail sales plunged. In November 2008 Americans, their confidence shaken, saved their money and sharply reduced their credit card purchases. Auto sales were down 37% in November (compared to Nov. 2007) to the lowest rate in 26 years. GM sales fell 41% Ford fell 31% and the foreign cars were down just as much, with Toyota down 34%, Nissan down 42% and Honda down 32%.[35] Retailers rang up the lowest November sales in more than 30 years, as holiday shopping not only failed to lift the economy but showed that the crisis is further distressing everyday consumers. Thirty major companies—including Macy's, Sears, Abercrombie & Fitch and Target—posted sales declines; Wal-Mart, anchoring the bottom of the price chain, sawincreased sales.  Retail sales in November fell 2.7 percent compared with the same month last year.[36]

 
The Federal Reserve reported on Dec. 3, 2008, that every region reported sales declines, drops in manufacturing activity, weakening real estate markets, tighter lending, and deteriorating labor marketsThose sectors that had been strong until recently—especially as agriculture and energy—also softened as commodity prices declined.  November saw 533,000 jobs disappear in the worst one-month decline in 34 years.

Shadow TARP
In 2011, it was revealed that the Federal Reserve secretly propped up elite bankers all the way from Wall Street to Brussels to the Central Bank of Libya.[37] This was the Fed covertly operating its own bailout program. The names of those involved were revealed by Bloomberg News and it took several years of Freedom of Information Act court battles to unearth Fed actions. The Fed would have never revealed its secret bailout on its own.

Collapse of #6 and #4 largest banks, rescue of #1
Washington Mutual collapses
On Sept. 25, Washington Mutual, the 6th largest bank in the US with $310 billion in assets, went bankrupt after a run in which depositors withdrew $17 billion in a few days. Its stockholders lost all their money, the US government took it over (through the FDIC, which insures ordinary bank deposits), and resold it the same day to the biggest New York bank, JPMorgan Chase. It was the largest commercial bank failure in American history, by far.[38]

Wachovia collapses
Meanwhile, the #4 U.S. bank, Wachovia, burdened by $120 billion in toxic securities,[39] was bought out by Citigroup on Sept. 29 in a deal engineered by the FDIC.  However Wachovia then broke its deal and merged into Wells Fargo. The result is that four major banks now dominate the American economy (Bank of America, Citibank, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo), along with dozens of regional chains and thousands of small local banks.

Bank of America renegotiates mortgages
In early October, Bank of America, the new owner of Countrywide, reached a settlement with 11 states that sued it over fraudulent practices. The state of Illinois accused Countrywide of relaxing underwriting standards, structuring loans with risky features, and misleading consumers with hidden fees and fake marketing claims, like a false promise of a ""no closing costs loan."" Countrywide gave special incentives to its brokers for selling impossible loans by paying higher commissions on them. In reviewing one Illinois mortgage broker's sales, the Illinois complaint said the ""vast majority of the loans had inflated income, almost all without the borrower’s knowledge.""  Bank of America did not deny the charges and instead agreed to pay out $8.4 billion to 400,000 Countrywide customers. Countrywide will reduce principal balances for some people and cut interest rates for others. Rates for some people could decline to as low as 2.5% and remain at that level for five years.  Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and IndyMac, now all owned by the federal government, have begun their own programs to modify mortgage terms for some hard-pressed borrowers.
[40]

Largest bank rescued
Citigroup, the world's largest bank was tottering in late November despite its receipt of $25 billion in TARP funding. Its value on the stock market plunged to $21 billion, down from $244 billion two years ago.  Round after round of layoffs have ended 75,000 jobs in 2008 out of 375,000 employees a year ago.  Very heavy exposure to toxic mortgages is the main culprit.  The government stepped in with the largest relief effort yet, including $20 billion in new cash, and guarantees of toxic assets by the Treasury, FDIC and Federal Reserve.
At all times Citigroup used elaborate mathematical risk models that looked at mortgages in particular geographical areas, but never included the possibility of a national housing downturn, or the prospect that millions of mortgage holders would default on their mortgages. The prevailing approach at Citigroup and the other big banks was to make money as fast as possible (generating annual bonuses of $10 to $30 million for senior executives), which assigning zero to the risk of a system-wide downturn. Such a downturn came with disastrous consequences for Citigroup and its rivals on Wall Street.  Even after Bear Stearns ran into serious trouble in summer 2007, Citigroup decided the possibility of trouble with its CDO's was so tiny (less than 1/100 of 1%) that they excluded them from their risk analysis.  
Despite two federal efforts Citigroup is still wobbly. It holds $20 billion of mortgage-linked securities that have been marked down to between 21 cents and 41 cents on the dollar. It has billions of dollars of giant buyout and corporate loans of dubious value. And it also faces a potential massive losses on auto, mortgage and credit card loans as the economy worsens.[41]
By the end of 2009 most big banks were in much better shape and the Treasury expects to recover all but $42 billion of the $370 billion it lent to ailing companies, with the portion lent to banks actually showing a slight profit.  Meanwhile, over 120 small and medium banks have been shut as insolvent; in most cases the FDIC picks up the losses and another bank takes over the operations and branches.[42]

Auto stimulus
In 2008 a series of damaging blows drove the ""Big Three"" (GM, Ford and Chrysler) to the verge of bankruptcy. Part of the cause was very high labor costs (much higher than the foreign plants in the U.S.), and lack of consumer demand for their products. The Big Three had in recent years stressed expensive, fuel-guzzling SUVs and large pickups. They were much more profitable than smaller, fuel-efficient cars. When gasoline prices shot past $4 in 2008, Americans stopped buying the big cars, and the Big Three saw their sales plummet.  The Financial Crisis played a role as no one was willing to loan GM the money to buy Chrysler. Consumer credit has tightened and it became much harder for people with average or poor credit to obtain a bank loan to buy a car, so sales fell further.  Stock prices plummeted as shareholders worried about bankruptcy; GM's shares fell to 1946 levels. Intense debate ensued about a massive bailout, that would be in addition to a $25 billion loan Congress passed in September 2008 to assist in increasing fuel efficiency. President Bush proposed changing the terms of that loan so it could be used to cover daily operating expenses, but Congress rejected that. Republicans in Congress in mid-November blocked Democratic proposals to underwrite a new bailout of the auto industry, as industry leaders made an unconvincing case before Congress.  President Obama and Democrats in Congress have demanded the Big Three come up with a highly specific plan with some chance of long-term viability. Critics claimed the proposals would lead to unnecessary job loss.
In addition to the Big Three hundreds of large suppliers of parts are in financial crisis as well; most would go under if the Big Three go bankrupt.
Intense debate in December 2008 focused on allowing bankruptcy or injecting billions more of federal aid; it would be in addition to a $25 billion loan Congress passed in September 2008 to assist in increasing fuel efficiency.  The Democrats in Congress supported president Bush's proposal to use the fuel-efficiency loans to help with the immediate problem. It passed the House but Senate Republicans broke with Bush and it failed.  The opponents called for a bankruptcy that would allow GM to get out of its contracts to pay union members high wages, as well as generous pensions and medical benefits to retired workers.  Bush then acted unilaterally and decided to make TARP loans to  GM and Chrysler, on December 19. GM and Chrysler will get $13.4 billions in loans they can use to pay their suppliers.[43] GM can receive another $4 billion in February, but by then the Obama administration will be in charge, and it is emphasizing the need for a long-range solution.[44]

Bankruptcy scenario
Bankruptcy of Chrysler and GM took place in the second quarter of 2009. Chrysler's sale to Italian automaker Fiat has been finalized. GM received billions more dollars to prevent bankruptcy but fell none-the-less. In addition, GM will require $30 billion in the first stage of bankruptcy. The Obama Administration is the single largest shareholder with the UAW second at 17% ownership. Also, many auto dealerships have been shuttered, thousands of workers have been laidoff, assembly plants closed, and product lines dissolved or sold.

Obama Administration
 Critics feared Geithner's vague plans would crash
The Obama Administration, taking office on Jan. 20, 2009,  moved to handle the crisis on two fronts.  Working with Democrats in Congress (and three moderate Republican Senators), it passed the ""American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009,"" calling for $500 billion of new spending and nearly $300 billion in new tax cuts. The new law began operations in mid-February, 2009, and supporters hoped it would slow and turn around the nosediving economy.  Conservative critics feared it would be ineffective in the short run and add to the national debt and tax burdens in the long run. As of late March no results are visible.
With major banks on the verge of failure, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner unveiled yet another massive bailout program in mid-February. Trillions would be spent to move toxic assets out of the banks, but few details were provided. The widespread reaction was very negative, and Geithner lost more of his credibility as a problem solver.  Geither finally came back with a plan on March 23 that will not need additional funding or approval by Congress.  The Treasury will use $100 billion from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), as well as new capital from private investors, in order to generate $500 billion in purchasing power to buy toxic loans and assets. The program could potentially expand to $1 trillion over time.

Criticisms
The nations banks now lend 25% less than when the financial bailout was announced. 
 The USA relies on China to buy our U.S. Treasury bonds to fund the increased spending. 
America is a debtor nation, we spend more than we save. The dollars value has plummeted against world currencies. Gold prices remain at record levels.The money that we don't have, but spend, will be a debt that future generations will have to worry about. This has brought rise to the term 'Generational Theft' in describing Obama policies.
""It's time to terminate the TARP program,"" Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, told reporters on Monday. ""TARP is increasingly not being a vehicle for economic stability and taxpayer protection but is evolving into 700 billion dollar revolving slush fund that the administration can use to advance economic, social and political agenda items far and apart from what Tarp was ever designed to do."" [45]
In the view of 51 mostly conservative economists polled by the Wall Street Journal in July 2009, the Obama administration's performance is problematic. President Obama and Treasury Secretary Geithner both got an average grade of 70 out of 100 for their handling of the financial crisis, but those grades varied widely. Former President Bush and ex-Treasury chief Paulson got average grades of 50 and 60, respectively, when economists were asked how they handled the crisis while in office. By contrast, Fed chairman Bernanke scores much better, with an average grade of 85; in addition 93% of respondents said he should be reappointed by Obama when Bernanke's term expires early next year.[46]

2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill,https://www.conservapedia.com/2010_Gulf_of_Mexico_oil_spill," President Obama directed the United States Coast Guard to dump toxic disperants into the Gulf of Mexico despite known health hazards to humans and wildlife. [3]The Gulf of Mexico oil spill began on 20 April 2010 when the Deepwater Horizon offshore oil drilling rig operated by BP (known as British Petroleum until 2000) exploded and sank.[1] Oil began leaking at a rate eventually estimated at 2.5 million gallons per day, resulting in massive environmental degradation.[2] The federal government reported that 206 million gallons of crude oil leaked before the spill was stopped on July 15.[3] The blowout killed eleven workers. Despite the known toxicity of the dispersant Corexit, the Obama administration dumped millions of gallons of the hazardous chemical into the Gulf of Mexico with C-130 aircraft provided by the U.S. Coast Guard[4] and the Air Force.[5]
On 31 March 2010 President Obama announced a plan for exploitation of offshore oil reserves during a speech at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington, D.C.[6] The President's actions have been labeled, ""a decision to endanger our coastal ecosystems with the risk of catastrophic oil spills.""[7] Defending the decision, the President remarked,



 “

 oil rigs today generally don’t cause spills. They are technologically very advanced.""[8][9]

 ”


Since taking office the Obama administration approved 346 oil drilling plans without securing permits required by law from the federal agency that assesses environmental impacts.[10] President Barack Obama has been widely criticized for an unprepared and bungled response, most notably from former supporters.

As of 15 July  2010 BP announced that the gushing well had been successfully capped. As of 4 August the government reported that only 26% of the originally leaked oil could be located in the Gulf.[11]

The Obama plan
 Map of expanded areas of offshore oil drilling authorized by President Obama on 31 March 2010.[12]Source: United States Department of Interior.
Obama called for expanded development and production throughout the Gulf of Mexico. The Department of Interior's Minerals Management Service (MMS) estimates that the Gulf of Mexico contains 36-41.5 billion barrels of  oil and 161-207 trillion cubic feet of natural gas resources. According a DOI press release, Obama's plan would ""expand oil and gas development and exploration"" while ""protecting fisheries, tourism, and places off U.S. coasts that are not appropriate for development.""[13]
The Associated Press has reported on the role ex-government regulators play in lobbying and influence; the chief of staff of the MSS's Gulf of Mexico region once stated that deep water drilling had ""few or no regulations or standards.""[14] Two years later the senior official left his job in the MMS to work for BP.[15] During President Obama's first year in office, as BP's regulatory compliance and environmental manager, the ex-MMS official lobbied the U.S. Ocean Policy Task Force to ""carefully weigh policies that may establish exclusionary zones"" or ""disrupt the MMS leasing program,"" according to a statement posted at whitehouse.gov.[16] He further stated that BP wanted access to off-limit areas such as the eastern Gulf of Mexico[17] which President Obama approved in March 2010.
Total U.S. offshore crude oil production in 2009 was 1.7 million barrels a day, of which 1.6 million barrels a day came from the U.S. section of the Gulf of Mexico.[18]
According to the New York Times, President Obama ""said several times during his presidential campaign that he supported expanded offshore drilling. He noted in his State of the Union address[19] in January [2010] that weaning the country from imported oil would require “tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development.”[20][21]
When questioned about the Obama regulators ""cozy relationship"" with oil companies the president responded, ""absolutely I take responsibility for that.""[22]

Obama administration asks Court to allow BP drilling in the Gulf of Mexico
Less than four months after President Barack Obama took office a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. found that the U.S. Government was unprepared for a major spill at sea, relying on an ""irrational"" environmental analysis of the risks of offshore drilling. The Obama administration urged the court to revisit the decision. In its arguments to the court, the Obama administration said that the loss of royalties on the oil, estimated at almost $10 billion, ""may have significant financial consequences for the federal government."" 
Among the existing leases was the Lease Sale #206. That deal included BP's acquisition, for $34 million, of the acreage encompassing the Deep Water Horizons well.
A day after the administration's petition, the industry's main lobbying group, the American Petroleum Institute, made its own case echoing the government's arguments. ""The significance of [Gulf of Mexico] activities under the five-year program cannot be overstated,"" the API argued.
Secretary Ken Salazar expressed confidence that problems within the Minerals Management Service that led to poor oversight of offshore drilling were resolved. In September 2009, in testimony before the House Natural Resources Committee, Salazar listed steps he had taken to make sure problems ""don't occur in the future.""
In Senate hearings held in mid-November 2009, Obama MMS Deputy Director Walter Cruickshank assured the Committee panel fears of containing a catastrophic blowout were misplaced, saying the U.S. had ""what we believe is the most aggressive oil spill contingency planning...in the world.""[23]

Approval of BP's response plan
The Obama administration accepted and approved BP's regional oil spill response plan for the Gulf of Mexico dated 30 June 2009[24] and covered all the company’s operations in the Gulf. The plan lists 

“Sea Lions, Seals, Sea Otters [and] Walruses” as “Sensitive Biological Resources” in the Gulf, suggesting that portions were cribbed from previous Arctic exploratory planning;
 Gives a web site for a Japanese home shopping site as the link to one of its “primary equipment providers for BP in the Gulf of Mexico Region [for] rapid deployment of spill response resources on a 24 hour, 7 days a week basis;” and
 Directs its media spokespeople to never make “promises that property, ecology, or anything else will be restored to normal.”[25]
The government approved plan made no mention about tracking sub-surface oil plumes from deepwater blowouts or preventing disease (viruses, bacteria, etc.) transmission to captured animals in rehabilitation facilities.

British Petroleum
During the first 100 days of the Obama administration, the Minerals Management Service (MMS) of the Department of the Interior granted a “categorical exclusion” from a detailed environmental impact statement required under law[26] to BP's Deepwater Horizon drilling operation, according to the Washington Post.[27] BP's exploration plan received in the Administration's MMS field office on 23 March 2009 states ""no mitigation measures other than those required by regulation and BP policy will be employed to avoid, diminish or eliminate potential impacts on environmental resources."" It declared any spill would have only ""sub-lethal"" effects on fish and marine mammals but it was ""unlikely that an accidental oil spill would occur from the proposed activities.""[28]
As Senator, and while running for president, Barack Obama received a total of $77,051 from BP[29] and has taken more money from BP's Political Action Committee and individuals connected with BP over the past 20 years than any other candidate, according to FEC disclosure records.[30] Likewise, the independent watchdog Center for Responsive Politics noted, ""the “top recipient of BP-related donations during the 2008 cycle was President Barack Obama himself.”[31][32]

 Obama approved drilling permits for BP without the statutory requirement to file an environmental impact assessment,[33] the handling of spills in a worst-case scenario,[34] and fostered a cozy relationship between government and the oil industry.[35] No other candidate took more money from BP in the past two decades than Obama received in only six years.[36]
Talk show personality Ed Schultz of MSNBC reiterated a call for campaign finance reform as a result of Barack Obama's ties to BP and the government's response.[37]
Transocean, owner of the Deepwater Horizons drilling rig leased to BP, was the recipient of the Obama Mineral Management Service's, Safety Award for Excellence.[38][39] On 30 April 2010 Transocean's stock fell after President Obama’s chief strategist, David Axelrod, made comments nine days into the disaster and the government raised estimates to more than fives times of what had previously been reported about how much oil was leaking into the Gulf of Mexico.[40]
It has been reported in the financial press that among owners of BP[41] are 

New Jersey Division of Investment (51 million shares)
California Public Employees Retirement System (36 million shares)
Pennsylvania Public School Employees Retirement System (7.1 million shares)
Teachers Retirement System of Alabama (4.5 million shares)
Employees Retirement System of Texas (4.1 million shares)
Ohio Public Employees Retirement System (1.1 million shares)
Illinois State Board of Investment (1.1 million shares)[42]
Indiana Public Employees' Retirement Fund (0.7 million shares)
Washington State Investment Board (1.2 million shares)
United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (21.9 million shares). 
BP was found wilfully negligent during the Bush administration in a Texas refinery explosion incident, and was assessed $108 million in fines - the highest workplace safety fines in U.S. history.[43]

Nalco and Corexit
 Dermatitis is one immediate health concern[44] of the Obama administration's decision to use toxic substances to disperse the visibility of the spill.  [4] Residents, cleanup workers, and tourists alike may be affected. [5]
Nalco of Naperville, Illinois formed a joint venture with Exxon Chemical in 1994 and the company's current leadership includes several executives from BP. Nalco reported it sold in excess of $40 million to BP of its dispersant, Corexit, shortly after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster.
Of 18 dispersants approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 12 were found to be more effective on southern Louisiana crude than Corexit, EPA data show.[45] Two of the 12 were found to be 100 percent effective on Gulf of Mexico crude, whereas two Corexit products rated only 56 percent and 63 percent effective.[46] The toxicity of the other 12 was shown to be in some cases 10 or 20 times less than Corexit, according to the EPA.[47] ""It's a chemical that the oil industry makes to sell to itself, basically,"" said Richard Charter, a senior policy adviser for Defenders of Wildlife.[48]
Corexit was found to be one of the most toxic dispersal agents ever developed.[49] With seasonal warming of water temperature the toxicity grows.  Corexit is banned in the United Kingdom due to environmental concerns.[50] The Obama EPA gave BP the green light to apply Corexit to the spill.[51]  At the Congressional hearing investigating the Gulf oil spill disaster, Democratic Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York raised the prospect of ""thousands and thousands of people getting sick or dying"" as a result of the administration's sanctioned use of the dispersant.[52] Critics allege use of dispersants like Corexit are largely for cosmetic purposes. Nalco has been a frequent contributor to the campaign of Sen. Mary Landrieu[53] of Louisiana.[54]

Deepwater Horizon
 Fire boat response crews battle the blazing remnants of the off shore oil rig Deepwater Horizon, April 21, 2010 (U.S. Coast Guard)
On Earth Day 2010, a BP-leased oil drilling rig sank to the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico two days after it exploded, creating what has been described as the ""worst environmental disaster in US history.""[55] Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar told CNN ""It potentially is catastrophic,"" and ""I think we have to prepare for the worst.""[56][57]
Congressional investigators think they have identified the rigs blowout preventer as the cause of the explosion.[58] The blowout preventer was leaking hydraulic fluid, had a dead battery,[59] and was inspected by the Obama Minerals Management Service (MMS) only two weeks before to the explosion[60] which killed 11 people. Amy Goodman, a leftist radio talk show host, has suggested those responsible should be prosecuted for manslaughter.[61]
Blowout preventers are meant to shut off the well, and the last line of defense is a set of shear rams which cut the pipe and seal off the well.[62] The MMS, the Obama administration agency that regulates offshore drilling along with the Coast Guard, is supposed to require  proof that shear rams are powerful enough to shut the well. Michael Saucier, MMS's regional supervisor testified before Congress that the MMS did not require BP to file a ""scenario for potential blowout.""[63] The MMS certified that BP ""has the capacity to respond, to the maximum extent practicable, to a worst-case discharge, or a substantial threat of such a discharge.""[64]
A May 2010 Inspector General's report revealed at least two MMS regulatory inspectors admitted to being under the influence of the illegal drug methamphetamine while on the job.[65][66]

Environmental disaster
 Projections of the flow of the spill over the summer of 2010. [6]
On 29 April 2010 oil began washing ashore in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana; four weeks later local leaders still were begging President Obama for federal assistance in responding to the disaster which was overtaking hundreds of miles of shoreline.[67]
Crude oil has washed into marshes, estuaries and onto beaches in Mississippi and Alabama. Wildlife has been killed and efforts are underway to save oil-coated
birds. Without capping the well Florida's Everglades may be turned into a ""dead zone."" Scientists expect currents to carry the oil slick to the eastern seaboard of the United States, fouling beaches and estuaries like the Chesapeake Bay and fishing grounds of the Grand Banks off Newfoundland.

Silverfish
Most scientists agree that Corexit 9500 will have a much larger biological effect when it reaches coastal areas teeming with wildlife.[68]  Many species are being threatened at a crucial time in their life cycle.[69] In testing done by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency the dispersant Corexit 9500 was found to be extremely lethal to silverfish, a benchmark organism in toxicity testing.[70]

Gulf menhaden
Gulf menhaden are a species harvested mostly for fish meal and fish oil. Menhaden could be badly affected
by the spill.

Coral, oyster and shrimp
Corals, oyster and shrimp likewise are critically affected. Richard Charter, a foremost expert on marine biology and oil spills who is a senior policy advisor for Marine Programmes for Defenders of Wildlife and is chairman of the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary Advisory Council has said, “There is a chemical toxicity to the dispersant compound that in many ways is worse than oil,” which ""in so doing you may be more seriously damaging the ecosystem offshore.”[71] Shrimp were found to be extremely vulnerable to the lethal effects of the chemical dispersant Corexit 9500 used by Obama administration disaster relief agencies and BP in testing done by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).[72]

Brown pelican
 Dead birds and sea turtles.
The Louisiana state bird, the Brown Pelican, was removed from protection under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 2009. The Obama administration approved BP's Deepwater Horizon drilling rig without the proper environmental impact assessment (EIA) required by law. The disaster occurred just as breeding season commenced.

Other bird species
Other species endangered by the oil spill are American oystercatcher and Wilson's plover.

Sea turtles
As several species of sea turtles move through the Gulf during their spring nesting season, they need to surface to breathe.

Toxic oil spill rain
A report prepared by the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources warned that the leaking crude oil into  the Gulf of Mexico is about to become the worst environmental catastrophe in all of human history, threatening the entire eastern half of North America with “total destruction.” Russian scientists based the assessment on the use of millions of gallons of the government approved chemical dispersant Corexit. 
The Russian scientists outlined that Corexit, with its 2.61ppm toxicity level,  combined with the seasonal warming of Gulf of Mexico waters, the molecules will be able to “phase transition” from their present liquid to a gaseous state allowing them to be absorbed into clouds and released as “toxic rain” upon all of Eastern North America.
The scientists warned should a Hurricane Katrina like storm form in the Gulf while tens of millions of gallons of Corexit are floating on or near the surface, the resulting “toxic rain” falling upon the North American continent could “theoretically” destroy all microbial life to any depth it reaches resulting in an “unimaginable environmental catastrophe” destroying all kinds of life forms.[73]

The response
Initially Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Coast Guard reported on 23 April 2010 there was no leak from the sunken oil rig.[74] The next day the Obama administration officially estimated a leak from the sunken well at 1000 barrels per day.[75] The Associated Press reported it took nine days after the explosion and the tragic loss of 11 workers lives before Obama made public commenta and acknowledged the disaster[76] and appointed a national incident commander.[77]
BP's stock fell[78] on news of the ""the worsening oil spill. "" Administration estimates were raised to 5000 barrels per day.[79]

U.S. Government dumps toxic dispersants into the Gulf of Mexico
 After President Obama's approval of the Deepwater Horizon's drilling rig permit and regulatory failures costing 11 workers their lives, the flow of oil into the Gulf of Mexico continued unabated for 86 days.
Wired Science reports the Obama administration disaster-relief agencies are using a toxic chemical to disperse oil in the Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster. Use of dispersants are said to be a public relations strategy.[80] Secretary Janet Napolitano of the Department of Homeland Security acknowledged[81] the U.S government was dumping toxic chemicals from C-130 cargo aircraft onto the spill.[82] Jackie Savitz of the ocean-conservation group Oceana stated the use of dispersants is only slightly less horrendous than the Gulf oil spill itself. ""You're basically pouring chemicals into the ocean, which is never a good thing.""[83] According to a 2009 Environmental Protection Agency report dispersants have not been used in the United State prior to the Obama administration's approval at BP'S request ""because of possible long-term environmental effects, difficulties with timely and effective application, disagreement among scientists and research data about their environmental effects, effectiveness, and toxicity concerns"" and the effects ""are still unknown.""[84] Residents in areas close to the oil spill have reported odors and symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, nausea, eye irritation, and respiratory problems.[85]

Disregard for worker safety
 Cleanup workers exposed to the Obama adminsitration's decision to use known toxic substances to disperse the spill. Critics allege dispersants are ineffective and largely for cosmetic purposes.
The Guardian (uk) has reported the controversy over Corexit exposes the Obama administration to criticism that its scientific agencies have been too accommodating to BP's strategy. In addition to the use of Corexit, the Obama Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) came under fire for withholding test results on the toxicity of the water close to shore.[86]
The dispersant 2-BE is known to cause heath dangers to clean up workers[87] and wildlife alike.[88] 2-BE has been documented to cause the breakdown of red blood cells, leading to blood in  urine and feces, and can damage the kidneys, liver, spleen and bone marrow of humans – effects not included on the information sheet for workers.[89] The dispersant Corexit 9500 is associated with headaches, vomiting and reproductive problems as sides effects to clean-up workers.[90] Lawrence Duffy of the University of Alaska claims dispersants ""are more a public relations measure than a preventive one. It has an effect on our psychology because we don't see the oil slick,""[91] though oil particles continue to do damage.[92]

Government mismanagement of relief efforts
Three weeks into the disaster National Public Radio reported the Obama administration's official figures were still grossly underestimated[93] and after the first month it was finally admitted the spill was nearly three times larger than earlier thought.[94]
Federal officials did not begin burning the leaking oil off the surface of the water until one full week after the rig collapsed.[95] Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal criticized President Obama for his slow response.[96] The New York Times castigated the White House for delays and not moving quick enough, calling the evidence ""damning"" and declaring the Gulf oil spill a ""huge disaster whose consequences might have been minimized with swifter action"" from the Obama administration.[97] One month into the spill, Democratic stalwarts James Carville,[98] Chris Matthews,[99] and Donna Brazile[100] criticized the inept and bungled response to the spreading catastrophe.

The White House lacked any type of plan to combat the disaster. House Democratic Majority Leader Steny Hoyer publicly admitted that the Obama Administration was ill-prepared to deal with the situation.[103]  While the disaster steadily grew, Obama did not discuss the crisis at length until he appeared at a photo op at Venice, Louisiana on 3 May 2010.[104]   He would order a moratorium on all future deep sea oil platforms until they determine the problems associated with the current situation. As to be expected, Obama tries to remove himself from blame saying ""the system failed"", this despite the fact the he heads the system. Then he pointed fingers of blame at oil companies while taking an indirect jab at the Bush administration.[105]



 “

 For too long, for a decade or more, there has been a cozy relationship between the oil companies and the federal agency that permits them to drill. It seems as if permits were too often issued based on little more than assurances of safety from the oil companies. That cannot and will not happen anymore.

 ”


White House spokesman Robert Gibbs did his best to put a good spin on the disaster claiming the response was ""comprehensive and fast.""  Meanwhile, the Democrat-led Congress ordered public hearings from oil executives. President Obama blamed others saying the answers from oil executives were a ""ridiculous spectacle,"" ""You had executives of BP and Transocean and Halliburton falling over each other to point the finger of blame at somebody else."" [106] As the disaster progressed and questions arose over the government's misreporting and withholding[107] of information from the public about the true dimensions of the calamity, the Associated Press noted, 



 “

 First [Obama] was going to make BP pay for the Gulf oil mess. Then he declared himself in charge. Now he's trying to find out 'whose ass to kick' and making clear he'd fire BP's chief if only he could.[108]

Revitalizing cap and trade energy tax
Main article: Cap and trade
President Obama has been roundly criticized by Democrats and Republicans alike for attempting to use the national tragedy to revitalized his failed Cap and Trade energy proposals. The Obama proposal, widely perceived as a job-killer tax increase, has stalled in the U.S. Senate. California Senator Dianne Feinstein has stated the climate bill ""isn't going to stop the oil leak.""[109]
Environmentalists want the President to push the program. Fred Krupp of the Environmental Defense Fund calls the opportunity ""a political moment"" to pass a carbon tax estimated to cost the average U.S. household $4300 per year.[110]
Joel Benenson, who conducted polling for Obama’s presidential campaign, thinks the tax increase could pass, but wary Senate Democrats say otherwise. “There’s not a great call for it"" said West Virginia Democratic Senator Jay Rockefeller. “It’s unrelated” to the immediate crisis in the Gulf noted Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat from Nebraska.[111]


Assistance of foreign governments
Nearly two-months after the disaster took place, the Obama administration decides to utilize the assistance offered by 17 countries, the U.N and the European Union.[112] International aid offers already accepted include two skimmers and 2.6 miles (4.2 kilometers) of boom from Mexico, three sets of sweeping arm systems from the Netherlands and 1.86 miles (3.0 kilometers) of boom from Canada, the State Department said. The State Department noted that it has assisted BP in directly sourcing equipment and technical experts from around the world, including from Algeria, Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Latvia, Norway, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom.[113]

Public relations offensive
Faced with declining poll numbers and a public relations calamity, President Obama took to the airwaves nearly 60 days into the spill. A New York Times Op-ed commented,



 “

 All we got from President Obama was a vague call for some sort of new energy policy. Plus a Gulf Coast Restoration Plan, an oil spill study commission, a reminder that the secretary of energy won a Nobel Prize in physics and 17 references to God, prayer, blessings or faith.[114][115]

 ”


Former speechwriter for President Jimmy Carter, Chris Matthews, chided the President after his address to the nation,



 “

 Ludicrous that he keeps saying [Secretary of Energy] Chu has a Nobel prize. I'll barf if he does it one more time.[116]

 ”


Misrepresentation of evidence
Drilling moratorium based on junk science
The Washington Post reported in November 2010 the oil spill that damaged the Gulf of Mexico's reefs and wetlands also threatens to stain the Obama administration's reputation for relying on science to guide policy. The Department of Interior's concluded that the White House edited a drilling safety report in a way that made it falsely appear that scientists and experts backed the administration's six-month moratorium on new deep-water drilling. The editing changes by the White House resulted ""in the implication that the moratorium recommendation had been peer reviewed."" But it hadn't been. Outside scientists were asked only to review new safety measures for offshore drilling.[117]
In October 2010 the Presidential Oil Spill Commission said that the White House Office of Management and Budget delayed publication of a scientific report that forecast how much oil could reach the gulf's shores. The report said that President Obama's energy adviser and Socialist International operative Carol Browner,[118] mischaracterized on national TV a government analysis about where the oil went, saying it showed most of the oil was ""gone."" It also said Browner and the head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Jane Lubchenco, contributed to the public's perception that the report was more exact than it was.
Academics, environmentalists and federal investigators have accused the administration since the April 2010 spill of downplaying scientific findings, misrepresenting data and misconstruing the opinions of experts it solicited.[119]

Economic impacts
 Oil slick map as of May 30, 2010.
The economic impact of the Gulf of Mexico oil drilling disaster will be large and devastating to several key industries, including fishing, tourism, and transportation.[120]
The top commercial species in terms of value are shrimp ($367 million), menhaden ($64 million), oysters ($59 million), and blue crab ($38 million).[121] As of 25 May 2010, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) closed 54,096 square miles to commercial and recreational fishing.[122] These areas are some of the richest fishing grounds in the Gulf of Mexico for major commercial species such as white shrimp, blue crab, and oysters.

Employment in fishing
The most immediate economic impact of the oil spill has been on the Gulf fishing[123] industry. The number of jobs at stake, which includes seafood processing and related wholesale and retail, is over 200,000 with related economic activity of $5.5 billion.[124]
Dockside sales in Louisiana are approximately $660 million.[125] Loses to the Louisiana fishing could  be as high as $2.5 billion.[126]

Employment in tourism
The tourist industry employs 620,000 people who earn over $9 billion in wages in the Gulf of Mexico region. Analysts say Florida alone could lose $3 billion in tourism.[127]
In 2008, recreational anglers took 25.4 million fishing trips and spent over $12 billion on equipment and trips in the Gulf region.[128] Some of the most popular recreational species include snappers, several types of drum, sheepshead, and Spanish mackerel. Recreational fisheries support businesses such as charters, bait and tackle, and services such as restaurants and hotels. 
In 2000, 21.9 million people visited Gulf beaches and accounted for 177.2 million beach days.[129]

Transportation
The Offshore Marine Service Association (OMSA),[130] the national trade association for U.S. flag vessels in the energy sector, criticized the Obama administration's moratorium on offshore drilling projects. 100,000 jobs were immediately affected by the president's decision as companies began cancelling contracts to carry supplies, forcing layoffs. ""The industry has struggled to climb out of a severe economic downturn. The moratorium threatens any hope of recovery and creates the potential for economic hardship that could last a decade or longer,"" remarked OMSA President Ken Wells.
OMSA estimates that for every mariner who works on board a vessel, there are nine other Americans working in shore-side jobs that support vessel operations. Beyond the vessel crew, the negative consequences of the moratorium could impact everyone from service technicians supporting everything from diesel engines to the air condition systems to the local grocer who supplies food for the boat's galley.
Offshore vessels are a major part of the tax base in many coastal communities. Gulf Coast state and local government revenues will also decrease due to lower income tax and sales tax collections.
Disruption of shipping traffic in and out of the Port of New Orleans will impact barge, container, and tanker traffic in the Mississippi Delta and along the Mississippi River.  Prices of all types of commodities would affected.

Insurance industry
BP, the operator on the oil drilling lease with a 65% stake, insured itself, rather than buying coverage from insurance companies. Industry analysts estimate total costs related to the oil spill cleanup and damages could exceed $14 billion.[131]

Lost revenue to state and local governments
Louisiana
A Greater New Orleans study indicates the Obama administration's moratorium could cost Louisiana as many as 22,000 jobs and more than $782 million in revenues.
With the average deepwater rig employing 230 workers with an average salary of $98,000, the study puts the tax revenue impact at $151 million if drilling were to resume within 18 months. Greater New Orleans President and CEO Michael Hecht says it’s difficult to be optimistic based on President Obama’s Oval Office address on 15 June 2010. President Obama's action “has the potential to turn an ecological tragedy into an economic calamity,” Hecht said.[132] The study foresees in a worse case scenario the loss of more than 22,000 jobs, 3,450 of them directly tied to the operating rigs and 18,945 with indirect ties such as catering firms and other companies that serve U.S energy producers.
Fearing that the drilling moratorium ""could exacerbate, rather than alleviate, the impacts of this spill upon both our economy and our environment,"" U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu wrote to President Obama on 11 June 2010.[133] Landrieu stated, 



 “

 more than 300,000 Louisianians are employed either directly or indirectly by the oil and gas industry. ..The immediate impacts to the economy are devastating enough: idling the 33 rigs currently permitted to drill in the deepwater Gulf would immediately impact employment for roughly 38,000 crewmen, deck hands, engineers, welders, ROV operators, caterers, helicopter pilots, and others who operate and service these vessels. That's like closing 12 large motor vehicle assembly plants in one state, all at once.

 ”


Lost state and local tax revenues will accrue at a rate between $8 million and $15 million a month. Federal royalty losses will be substantial and a significant drop in tolls collected for the Louisiana Highway 1 bridge at Leeville, the main artery to the Port Fourchon energy port is projected as well.

Texas
The Texas state comptroller’s office reported collection of $2.3 billion in oil and natural gas production taxes in fiscal year 2009 and $4.1 billion in 2008. The tax revenue is used to repair roads and fund schools, among other state services. Although no official analysis of President Obama's decision to place a moratorium on offshore production has been compiled yet, the Texas comptroller’s office said it’s unclear how much of an impact the president's decision will have on state services. Experts warn the president's decision could threaten tens of thousands of jobs in the Houston area.[134]

Alabama
Manufacturing jobs in Alabama are at risk as a result of President Obama's actions, as no new orders for equipment are coming in.[135]

Increased dependency on foreign oil
New Jersey Democrat Senator Robert Menendez proposed a ban on new offshore drilling permits and submitted a bill that would retroactively raise the financial liability of BP from $75 million to $10 billion.[136] Oklahoma Republican Senator James Inhofe successfully killed the bill saying it would reduce competition and shut down smaller independent oil companies in favor of larger companies.

Too big to fail
An oil industry trade publication[137] reports President Obama and senior White House staff, as well as Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, are working with BP on legislation that would raise the cap on liability for damage claims from those affected by the oil disaster from $75 million to $10 billion. However the disaster has the real potential of costing nearly $1 trillion. Critics point out that in the deal between Obama and BP, $10 billion is a drop in the bucket for a trillion dollar disaster. Talk is noted in government circles, including FEMA, of the need to nationalize BP in order to compensate those who will ultimately be affected by the worst oil disaster in the history of the world, and BP would, if its assets were nationalized, be credited with almost a trillion dollars for compensation purposes.[138][139]
After Obama charged Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate the disaster, BP establish a $20 billion extrajudicial fund managed by an Obama appointee.[140] Former CNN news writer and radio talk show host Mike Malloy suggested Holder is beholden to corporatist interests.[141]

Criticism of the Obama administration's handling of the disaster
 Memorial service for the 11 workers killed in the explosion.Reuters [8]
Former top adviser to President Bill Clinton, James Carville, turned visibly emotional in an interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC's Good Morning America over President Barack Obama's ""lackadaisical"" response to the Gulf oil spill disaster. 



 “

 The political stupidity is unbelievable. ... The President of the United States  could have come down here. He could have been involved with the families of these 11 people...... He could have implemented a plan in anticipation of this... He could be commandeering tankers and making BP bring tankers in and clean this up.... He could be deploying people to the coast. He could be with the corps of engineers and the Coast Guard with these people in Plaquemines Parish, doing something about these regulations. These people are crying. They're begging for something down here. And it just looks like he's not involved in this! Man, you have got to get down here and take control of this! Put somebody in charge of this and get this thing moving! We're about to die down here![142][143][144]

 ”


Carville also said in a separate interview on CNN with Anderson Cooper,



 “

 They are risking everything by this ‘go along with BP’ strategy they have. They seem, like, lackadaisical on this...they seem like they’re inconvenienced by this, this is some giant thing getting in their way and somehow or another, if you let BP handle it, it’ll all go away. It’s not going away. It’s growing out there. It is a disaster of the first magnitude...the government thinks that they are partnering with BP. I think they actually believe that BP has some kind of a good motivation here. That’s one of the, sort of, whole flaws is they're naïve.[145][146]

 ”


Obama acknowledged the criticism days later in a televised press conference:



 “

 Where I was wrong was in my belief that the oil companies had their act together when it came to worst-case scenarios.[147]

 ”


 Day 12 of the Disaster: Obama enjoys an evening of levity and banter with the Washington Press Corps at the White House Correspondent's Dinner.
MSNBC talk show host Chris Matthews[148] said on Jay Leno's Tonight Show,



 “

 The president scares me. He's been acting a little like a Vatican Observer here. When is he actually going to do something? And I worry. I know he doesn't want to take ownership of it. I know politics. He said the minute he says, 'I'm in charge,' he takes the blame.[149]

 ”


Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential campaign manager in 2008 questioned if Democratic primary voters had 



 “

 underestimated the value of experience and crisis management as important attributes for their president.[150]

 ”


Donna Brazile, who managed the presidential campaign of Democratic candidate Al Gore in 2000 said on ABC's This Week,



 “

 One of the problems I have with the administration is that they're not tough enough. They are waiting for BP to say, ‘oh, we've got a new plan to stop the oil leak.’ They need to stop it, contain it, clean it up, and try to help us conserve our coastal wetlands.[151]

 ”


Dick Morris, an intimate adviser to President Bill Clinton observed,



 “

 these failings show that Obama is in over his head. But to the left, which bleeds for each drop of water in the gulf and cries over every turtle or shrimp or sea bird, it is an unpardonable sin...Obama's incompetence and inexperience is causing liberals to see him as arrogant, aloof, removed, conceited, suspicious of outside advice and even lazy...these character defects will haunt the president until 2012 and beyond.[152]

 ”


David Gergen worked in the Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Clinton White House remarked,



 “

 If our government had fought WWII like the way we’re fighting the oil spill, there’s a good chance many of us would be speaking German today.[153]

 ”


Republican Chairman Michael Steele criticized the president for golfing while the oil crisis worsened.[154]



 “

 Until this problem is fixed, no more golf outings.

 ”


Peggy Noonan, a speech writer for President's Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, summed up public perceptions with,



 “

 The president, in my view, continues to govern in a way that suggests he is chronically detached from the central and immediate concerns of his countrymen.... he has not, almost from the day he was inaugurated, been in sync with the center....The American people have spent at least two years worrying that high government spending would, in the end, undo the republic. They saw the dollars gushing night and day...And now we have a videotape metaphor for all the public’s fears: the well gushing black oil into the Gulf of Mexico ...His philosophy is that it is appropriate for the federal government to occupy a more burly, significant and powerful place in America—confronting its problems of need, injustice, inequality. ... Then the oil spill came and government could not do the job, could not meet the need ...Katrina illustrate[d] that even though the federal government in our time has continually taken on new missions and responsibilities, the more it took on, the less it seemed capable of performing even its most essential jobs. Conservatives got this point—they know it without being told—but liberals and progressives did not. They thought Katrina was the result only of George W. Bush’s incompetence and conservatives’ failure to “believe in government.” But Mr. Obama was supposed to be competent....It’s not good to have a president in this position—weakened, polarizing and lacking broad public support—less than halfway through his term. That it is his fault is no comfort.[155]

 ”


New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd wrote,



 “

 Obama and top aides who believe in his divinity make a mistake to dismiss complaints of his aloofness as Washington white noise. He treats the press as a nuisance rather than examining his own inability to encapsulate Americans’ feelings.[156]

 ”


Actor Robert Redford demanded action from the Obama administration. The liberal special interest group Natural Resources Defense Council has Redford in a new ad decrying the lackluster response.[157] Redford made an appearance on MSNBC and said there is no one manning this ship,



 “

 In this case, we don’t need a disaster manager, we need a leader.

Foreign reaction
Relations between allies the U.K. and U.S. are now at historic lows thanks to Barack Obama's mishandling of the oil spill. Britain had been repeatedly mocked by Obama prior to the spill[161][162][163] but now find themselves subjected to endless propaganda. Prominent foreign dignitaries have expressed the public's growing frustration with the administration's posturing and hunt for scapegoats. The mayor of London, Boris Johnson, who supported Obama in 2008, decried ""anti-British rhetoric, buck-passing and name-calling"" while Lord Tebbit branded Mr Obama's conduct “despicable” and the president's rhetoric 



 “

 a crude, bigoted, xenophobic display of partisan political Presidential petulance.""[164][165]

 ”


The atmosphere Obama created in Britain is so toxic that the British press has labelled Barack Obama the most unpopular man in England.[166]

European history
High taxes and a very unfair and inefficient collection system were one cause of the French Revolution in 1789.

World History
http://history-world.org/reforms_of_urukagina.htm
Sumerian City Lagash instigated history's first recorded Tax revolt. This came after Lagash's rulers had increased local taxes and restricted personal freedoms. The people of Lagash resented this enough that they overthrew their King. They brought to power a god-fearing ruler named Urukagina, who eliminated excessive taxation and rid the city of usurers, thieves and murderers—the first known reform.  Time frame is stated for Urukagina (reigned ca. 2380 BC–2360 BC) However the dating process is in doubt as is all dating systems for ancient world.

United States history
In 1765 the colonists protested vigorously against the Stamp Act, a small but illegal tax levied by the British Parliament on legal paperwork.   The colonists said that Parliament had no right to levy taxes, because the colonists were not represented. ""No taxation without representation"" became the cry.  Americans successfully boycotted merchants and Britain repealed the tax. It was the start of a chain of anti-tax protests leading to the American Revolution. British anger at the tax revolt that dumped taxed tea into Boston harbor—the ""Boston tea Party""—speeded the route to revolution.
During Reconstruction, ex-Whigs and ex-Democrats, calling themselves ""Conservatives"" protested the high taxes levied by the Republican Party state governments. By 1877 the Conservatives, calling themselves ""Redeemers"" took control of all southern states.

From the 1880s to the 1910s, conservative Democrats, led by Grover Cleveland and the Bourbon Democrats protested the high tariffs that speeded up industrialization, claiming it taxed the ordinary citizen too much.

 Democrats protesting tariffs, 1912
In 1914 the Wisconsin Progressives under Robert LaFollette were defeated in state elections because the conservative Republicans complained of high taxes.
During the Great Depression, prices, profits and incomes fell, but taxes went up.  Local taxpayers in many cities, most notably Chicago, withheld taxes.[1]  In 1932 Republican President Herbert Hoover raised taxes, making the depression worse. President Franklin D. Roosevelt tried to not raise taxes, but he did add the new Social Security tax in 1937. Other taxes were tried but repealed.  Meanwhile, most state governments in the 1930s added a new tax—the sales tax on purchases.
In the 1970s a grass roots political movement led by Howard Jarvis protested fast-rising property taxes in California. They passes a statewide initiative in 1978, Proposition 13, still in effect, which capped property taxes.
In 1981 and 1985 President Ronald Reagan successfully lowered federal taxes.  His crusades became a model for the Republican Party for the next quarter-century.

 Reagan rallies his supporters agains the powerful special interests in 1985. Reagan won.

Turkey (which in 1923 became the successor state to the Ottoman Empire) has denied its responsibility, suggesting that preplanned genocide did not occur. Turkey says it was a confusing period where many people were killed because of political uprisings. To this day, Turkey denies it and did not even release their records.

Background
Following victory over Persia at the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514, the Ottoman Empire extended its rule over western Armenia. In 1555 Armenia was divided between the Shahs of Persia and the Sultans of Turkey. 
In traditional Ottoman society the Armenians were defined, as were other Christians and the Jews, as a dhimmi millet, a non-Muslim religious community of the empire. Their actual treatment by the state varied to some extent with the military fortunes of the empire, the religious passions of its elites, and the encroachment upon their land by Muslim refugees from the Balkans and the Caucasus as well as by Kurdish pastoralists. Normally dhimmis were free to practice their religion, but they were distinctively inferior to Muslims in status. In the nineteenth century the Armenians challenged the traditional hierarchy of Ottoman society as they became better educated, wealthier, and more urban. In response—despite attempts at reforms—the empire became more repressive toward Armenians, who more than any other Christian minority bore the brunt of persecution
In the 19th century, Russia, after victories over Persia in 1828 and over Turkey in 1829, acquired the right to organize the immigration of Armenians into the Caucasus with the aim of developing the territories. Under Russia, the number of Armenians in the area now represented by present-day Soviet Armenia increased from 46,000 in 1827 to 511,000 in 1897. Thus by joining Russia, Eastern Armenia became the home of the national survival of the Armenian people. The fate of Western Armenia was different. The organized massacres of 1894-96 and 1909 and the genocide of 1915 completely depopulated Western Armenia. 
Conflict between Turks and Armenians resulted from dissimilar cultural elements and social organization. By the end of the 19th century, the Ottoman authorities justified their attacks on Armenians by accusing them of being ""revolutionaries, terrorists, and troublemakers acting on behalf of Russia or other foreign powers."" Even with the demise of the Ottoman Empire following World War I, the conflict between Turks and Armenians remained unresolved, resulting in contemporary Armenian terrorist attacks on Turkish targets.

Kurds
The Turks often used Muslim Kurds as intermediary oppressors between themselves and the Christian Armenians. Less firmly Islamic Kurds, however, often aided persecuted Armenians, and at times when the Kurds themselves were oppressed, Kurdish-Armenian solidarity emerged. The complex history of Turkish-Kurdish-Armenian relations culminated in Kurdish complicity in the genocide committed against the Armenians during World War I. Thereafter, Kurds and Kurdish independence movements became the chief targets of Turkish policies attempting to Turkify all Anatolia.[3]

Armenian nationalists
Following the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, Russians occupied the six Armenian vilayets, and Armenian nationalism was stimulated. In 1880, a revolutionary organization known as the Defenders of the Fatherland was organized in Erzurum. A few years later, in 1885, the Armenakan society was organized, and in 1887 the Hunchagian Party appeared. The Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaktzutun) was formed in 1890.  
The Armenians expected outside assistance in their efforts to break away from Ottoman rule and were led to carry out a number of rash terror actions, including bombing and assassinations.  The Russians therefore discouraged the Armenian liberation movement from establishing an independent Armenia on the southern borders of Russia. But the Russian government also took active steps to prevent the massacres of Armenians by Sultan Abdul Hamid.  
When Sultan Abdul Hamid II came to power in 1876, he steered a course of political and social repression and technological modernization.  But the Empire was the ""sick man of Europe"" and nationalist revolts among Christian minorities led to the loss of Serbia, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Montenegro, Romania and large parts of Bulgaria, which comprised 40% of the territory. Some 400,000 Muslim refugees were expelled; the Empire became more Muslim and hatred of Christians intensified.  The old program of using Christian minorities to speed the modernization process had failed. The Empire was bankrupt and the Christians wanted autonomy, not participation. 
In August and September 1894, a series of massacres occurred in the vicinity of Sassun as a result of an uprising that was put down with ferocity by Kurdish irregular cavalry (Hamidieh regiments). The massacres soon spread, and in October and November 1895 there were pogroms at Trabzon, Erzurum, Bitlis, Kurun, Maras, and elsewhere. The essential cause of the massacres lay in the failure of the European powers to secure the reforms envisaged by the Treaty of Berlin for the Asian provinces of the Ottoman Empire. In August 1896 after an attack on the Ottoman Bank in Constantinople a massacre of Armenians occurred in the Ottoman capital; 4,000 to 6,000 Armenians were killed. By the end of 1896 over 80,000 Armenians lad dead in the eastern provinces.
It is still not clear what role he and his regime played in the massacres of 1894-1896, but massacres set off large-scale protests, especially in the United States and Britain. The protests forced Sultan Abdul-Hamid II to appoint an investigating commission, joined by British, French, and Russian delegates, which produced a minor reform program. Despite his policy of ruthless repression, the sultan could not halt the military and political disintegration of his regime, and he was replaced in 1908 by the political revolution of the Young Turks, who sought to address the Ottoman crisis with new and radical ideas.

Young Turks
The Young Turks had an entirely new approach. They did not want modernity, they wanted a Pan-Islamic empire based on Turks and other Muslim ethnic groups.  Christians, especially Greeks and Armenians were distrusted; large numbers emigrated.  By  April, 1909, there were massacres at Adana and other places of Lesser Armenia, sparked by peaceful demonstrations that inflamed nationalist Turks. Intermittent attacks took place in the following years, against the background of the disintegration of the empire.  When the Armenians threatened to add to the losses the Young Turks drew the line, began advocating a xenophobic and chauvinistic brand of nationalism that sought to create a new empire based on Islam and Turkish ethnicity. This new empire, stretching from Anatolia to western China, would exclude minorities unless they became Turks by nationality and Muslims by religion. The Armenians would rather die than give up their Christian religion; the Young Turks found willing allies in Kurdish elements in Anatolia who had long been hostile to the Armenians.  Armenians grew closer to Russia, the Orthodox Christian nation that seemed best poised to protect them.  The people in eastern Armenia were protected by the Russians and by 1919 had their own nation. The 3 million people in western Armenia were under Turkish control and they were the victims. 


World War I
The Young Turk ""Ittihad ve Terrake Djemieti"" [Committee of Union and Progress, or CUP] took the opportunity afforded by the war with Russia to solve its ""Armenian question.""  The Empire was at war with Russia, with military action in and near Armenia.  The Armenians were seen as allies of the Russians, and could not be trusted with weapons.  At end of 1914, Armenian soldiers in the Ottoman forces were disarmed; many were killed. In April 1915 hundreds of writers, journalists, and artists were arrested, exiled, and murdered.  In June, 1915, as western powers threatened to punish those who committed atrocities against the Armenians, the government escalated its attacks and decided to forcibly remove all the Armenians living in eastern Armenia, near the Russian border—the Armenian homeland for many centuries.  The deportation was the height of cruelty, in western Armenia, Cilicia, and surrounding regions, followed.[4] The long lines of Armenian deportees were set upon again and again by Turkish and Kurdish villagers who in many cases had been incited and were led by specially designated killing squads, that Armenians believe were organized at the highest levels of the government. Those Armenians who escaped massacre and reached the camps in Syria were very likely to perish of hunger, dehydration, or exposure on the way. Between 1915 and the armistice in 1918, some one million Armenians, out of a population of two million, were killed; others were killed in organized fighting after 1918.[5] The Turkish mindset looked at adult men as the carriers of Armenian identity; they were killed. Women and children were considered to have malleable ethnic identity according to which men controlled them. Children especially were taken and raised as Turks or Kurds; women were made permanent servants or kept in harems.[6]
Many  Armenians who survived the ordeal settled in Lebanon, with an Armenian population of 200,000 in the 1970s; large numbers dispersed worldwide, especially to California.

Diplomatic response
The Allied Powers, at war with the Ottoman Empire, expressed outraged at the mass-murder of the Armenians. They pledged retribution against the perpetrators and support for an independent Armenian republic. On May 24, 1915, the Allies referred to the genocide as a ""crime against humanity and civilization,"" and warned that they would hold Turkish officials ""who have participated in the massacres personally responsible.""  In May 1918, a small and vulnerable Armenian Republic was founded in the Caucasus and expanded into parts of Ottoman Armenia as the Turkish army withdrew from the region; it was taken over by the Soviet Union in 1920. 
American pubic opinion was outraged at the genocide of Christians by Muslims, and sent tens of millions of dollars in relief aid, setting up refugee camps especially in Russia.  

Postwar
The Treaty of Sèvres, Aug. 10, 1920, provided for an independent Armenia. However, the situation was drastically changed by Turkish military assaults and the establishment of a Soviet republic in Yerevan, Armenia, in late 1920. A treaty imposed on Armenia by Turkey on December 3 reduced Soviet Armenia to the province of Yerevan.  It finally became independent in 1991.
In postwar Turkey, international pressure forced war crimes trials in 1919-20 against the Young Turk faction. The triumvirs who ruled Turkey in 1915 and had ordered the genovide—War Minister Enver Pasha, Interior minister Talat Pasha, and defense minister Ahmed Djemal Pasha—were condemned to death. They had fled Turkey but were tracked down and assassinated by Armenians as part of ""Operation Nemesis,"" designed to kill the 200 Turks most involved in the genocide.[7]  The new leader of Turkey after the war, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk had broken with the Young Turk group in 1914, was never involved in the genocide, and ended the privileged position given to Islam. Some 150,000 Armenians lived in Istanbul throughout the period; in the rmenian homeland areas of eastern Turkey almost all the Armenians were gone.

Memory
Historical work on the genocide has been almost entirely pro-Armenian or pro-Turkish and therefore implicated in a political conflict still unresolved today. Armenian historians seek to exorcise the trauma experienced by earlier generations, to pass on the memory of this trauma, and to present the genocide of the Armenians as the founding element of contemporary Armenian identity. 
British historian Arnold Toynbee, whose 1917 report remains a critical primary source, changed his evaluation later in life, concluding, ""These…Armenian political aspirations had not been legitimate....Their aspirations did not merely threaten to break up the Turkish Empire; they could not be fulfilled without doing grave injustice to the Turkish people itself.""[8]
For Turkish historians, supporting the national republican myth is essential to preserving Turkish national unity. The usual Turkish argument is that the deportations were necessary because the Armenians had allied themselves with Russian invaders in wartime, and ""some 100,000 Armenians...may have died between 1915 and 1918, but this was no greater a percentage than that of the Turks and other Muslims who died as a result of the same conditions in the same places at the same time.""  ""There was no genocide committed against the Armenians in the Ottoman Empire before or during World War I."" [9]  Dissident historians in Turkey are trying to reclaim the Armenians as part of Ottoman and Turkish history and acknowledge the wrongs done to the Armenians as a condition for reconciliation with them on the basis of confidence in Turkish national unity.[10]
Six decades after the event a revival of Armenial nationalism led to an organized Armenian terrorist campaign that began in 1975, targeting Turkish diplomats.  For example,  Kemal Arikan, the new Turkish consul general in Los Angeles was assassinated on January 28, 1982,[11]

Diplomacy
Following the collapse of the USSR in 1991, the Caucasus became a new field for Turkish foreign policy, and in this region relations with Armenia became the most critical and sensitive challenge. Despite the extreme negative historical legacy of the genocide, Turkey tried to establish a new basis for relations with Armenia, and there were some positive steps taken in this direction under the presidency of Levon Ter-Petrosian in Armenia. Disputes over the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh became the decisive factor in bilateral relations, as predominantly Armenian population in Nagorno-Karabakh protested control by the Muslim Republic of Azerbaijan, which had Turkey's support. During the presidency of Ter-Petrosian's successor, Robert Kocharian, aside from the Nagorno-Karabakh problem, diaspora communities gained influence, which led to the genocide issue again becoming an important element in bilateral relations. Despite Kocharian's early hawkish rhetoric, during the second term of his presidency a détente arose in relations between the two countries, and the Turkish-Armenian Peace Commission founded in 2001 was a significant step in the direction of better relations.
Internationally, twenty-one countries have recognized the tragedy as genocide, as have 32 U.S. states.[12] This has been a problem in the Turkish-Armenian relationship, as well as the relationship with Israel, which is a close ally of Turkey, and the U.S., which has a very large an active Armenian population of Armenian descent, and tries to be friends with both Turkey (a NATO ally), and Armenia.
In 2007 a proposal[13] to denounce the genocide was heatedly debated in the U.S. Congress, with the State Department and White House warning that passage would seriously damage relations between the U.S. and Turkey.  the resulution did not pass, and President Obama visited Turkey in 2009 without incident.

"""Big Bill"" Haywood",https://www.conservapedia.com/%22Big_Bill%22_Haywood,"William Dudley ""Big Bill"" Haywood (1869-1928) was the founder in 1905 of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), nicknamed the ""Wobblies"".[1]
Before founding the IWW, Haywood, an avowed atheist[2] and Communist,[3] was secretary-treasurer of the Western Federation of Miners (WFM), to whom he suggested in 1899 that they had a right to steal gold because the nation's wealth belonged to those who produced it.[4]
That year, while the Idaho state militia was in the Philippines, the WFM struck, seizing a Northern Pacific train and 400 pounds of dynamite. The mob, estimated at 1,000 men, many armed and masked, shot and killed two men, and blew up two mines,[5] causing $250,000 in damages,[6] equivalent to more than $5 million today.[7] In the absence of the militia, Governor Frank Steunenberg appealed to President William McKinley for Federal assistance. The U.S. Army sent 400 troops of the 24th Infantry and Fourth Cavalry (mostly African-Americans),[8] under Brigadier General H.C. Mirriam,[9] who placed Shoshone County under martial law, served warrants on hundreds of rioters, and quelled the violence.[10]
Steunenberg retired at the end of his term in 1901, but was assassinated in 1905 by a bomb planted at his home. Within hours and confronted with overwhelming evidence, former miner Albert E. Horsley (alias Thomas Hogan and Harry Orchard) confessed to the murder,[11] implicating Haywood as a co-conspirator.[12] Horsley's partner Steve Adams also confessed[13] but later recanted and disappeared.[14] Haywood was indicted and tried in 1907 for conspiracy to commit murder.[15] He was represented by perhaps the greatest murder defense lawyer of his time,[16] Clarence Darrow.[17] Haywood was acquitted, after the judge instructed the jury, ""under the statutes of this state, a person cannot be convicted of a crime upon testimony of an accomplice, unless such accomplice is corroborated by other evidence.""[18]

Haywood meanwhile had left the WMF to found the IWW.[19]  Bombing of the Federal building, Chicago, moments after 95 Wobblies were convicted there, 1918. Source: National Archives and Records AdministrationDuring World War I, the IWW tried to sabotage the U.S. war effort. All leading Wobblies were arrested by the Wilson Administration under the Sedition Act of 1918 and went to prison. Moments after the sentencing of 95 Wobbies (including Haywood) at the Chicago Federal Building in 1918, a bomb ripped through the building, killing four.[20] Out on appeal in 1921, Haywood fled to Moscow, where he became a trusted adviser to the Bolshevik government.[21]
In 1921, after the Bolsheviks brutally crushed a wave of strikes, Haywood betrayed the workers, saying, ""every genuine labor union in the United States ought to affiliate with the International Council of Trade and Industrial Unions with its central bureau at Moscow."" Later renamed the World Federation of Labor Unions, this was the phony ""union"" created and controlled by the Kremlin to suppress workers' rights in the Soviet Union.[22]

1960s,https://www.conservapedia.com/1960s," 
The Sixties (the 1960s) is widely celebrated by leftists and liberals as a decade of progress and freedom.  However, it was in reality a decade that saw the origin or the worsening of some of the gravest ills to afflict modern society. Far from being the decade of 'peace and love' it was a period of left-inspired war and terror, including the escalation of the Vietnam War and the outbreak of the Cultural Revolution; the 'events' of 1968 in universities across the western world saw a minority rabble of Trotskyist and Maoist students try to impose their views on society; and the so-called social revolution of the period saw a massive upsurge in sexual immorality and the abuse of illegal drugs. Leftist and other 'trendy' educational theories began their assault upon the education of our children. As history Professor Gerard DeGroot records, ""For too long the Sixties has been a sacred zone... Cast aside the rose-tinted spectacles and we see mindless mayhem, shallow commercialism and unbridled cruelty... [While the '60s brought] flowers, music, love and good times... It also brought hatred, murder, greed, dangerous drugs, needless deaths, ethnic cleansing, neo-colonialist exploitation, sound-bite politics, sensationalism, a warped sense of equality, a bizarre notion of freedom, and the end of innocence."" [1] Margaret Thatcher noted, ""We are reaping what was sown in the sixties... fashionable theories and permissive clap-trap set the scene for a society in which the old virtues of discipline and restraint were denigrated."" [2]

Assault upon religion
This might be said to be two-pronged. The Sixties saw moves away from revealed to religion amongst young people in favour of a half-baked and quarter-understood mish-mash of eastern mysticism, sexual hedonism and drug abuse of the kind peddled by The Beatles in their 'Maharishi' phase; John Lennon of The Beatles went on, in his song Imagine, to celebrate and propagandize a nihilistic and atheistic view of human life. Simultaneously, many Christian priests and ministers themselves undermined Christianity by a variety of means: from watering down the required standards of Christian behaviour in a misguided attempt to seem 'trendy' and 'relevant', completely overlooking the relevance of Faith; to harnessing the Bible to Karl Marx, in the form of the so-called Liberation Theology which did much to inspire left-wing terrorism in Latin America.

The 'Permissive Society': license unbridled
Chastity, restraint, and human values of decency were mocked by the 'gurus' of permissiveness. Instead, the increasing availability of artificial contraception in the form of contraceptive pills, fueled a wave of promiscuity and the promotion and practice of all forms of perversity. This was encouraged by the fashion industry: immodest apparel such as mini-skirts were flaunted by females, while androgynous clothing, eroding the masculine role, was marketed to men (The Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger notoriously took to a stage in London's Hyde Park wearing a lace dress). Restrictions on pornography were eroded or evaded, a seminal event here being the decision of a UK court in 1963 to allow the publication of an unexpurgated version of D.H. Lawrence's novel Lady Chatterley's Lover despite its overt and explicit sexual content. Legal reforms permitted or loosened restrictions on homosexuality, divorce and abortion, undermining the very fabric of family life. Feminists such as Germaine Greer launched assaults on traditional male-female relationships, while Lesbian separatists argued that women (which they spelled wimmin or womyn) and men should lead entirely separate lives. The use of foul language and displays of nudity became a commonplace on television in many western nations, with the BBC in the van.

'Turn on, tune in, drop out'
This quotation, by 'counter-culture' guru Dr Timothy Leary, epitomizes the attitude of many 1960s nostalgics towards illegal drugs. Drugs have been a perennial problem in societies worldwide, but in the 1960s the problem became much worse. This is because drug-taking, which was previously the covert activity of a tiny minority, perceived as immoral as well as illegal by society, suddenly became portrayed as acceptable in the media. Worse, advocates of 'permissiveness' such as Leary openly recommended the use of mind-altering drugs as a means to access a different, supposedly better, reality. Many, if not most, of these advocates had inadequate personalities which prevented them from participating fully in the richness of real life. However, their pernicious effect upon a generation of impressionable young people has been incalculable. 
Drug abuse often went hand in hand with left wing politics, and the 'joint' or 'reefer' became the trademark of the 1960s student leftist plotting world revolution in his bedsit or student dorm.

Music and Literature
The Sixties inspired many modern greats in music and literature which endure cross generationally, despite grave misgivings about their personal morality, drug use, incipient Hollywood values and the messages conveyed:

Successes in the Sixties
The Sixties however did have some good points. The Civil Rights Movement gained momentum during this period, which saw the end of segregation of the African Americans. The societal problems caused by the erosion of restraint inspired campaigners such as Mary Whitehouse to take a stand for decency and Christian standards. Also in 1969 the United States scored a remarkable triumph on behalf of the Free World in the Space Race, overcoming a Soviet lead earlier in the decade, with two members of the courageous crew of Apollo 11 becoming the first two humans to step on to the Moon

16h Amendment,https://www.conservapedia.com/16h_Amendment," Ratification page for the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (1913)
The Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution allows the Congress to ""lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived"".
Far-reaching in its social as well as its economic impact, the income tax amendment became part of the Constitution by a curious series of events culminating in a bit of political maneuvering that went awry.

Background
Civil War
The financial requirements of the American Civil War prompted the first American income tax in 1861. At first, Congress placed a flat 3-percent tax on all incomes over $800 and later modified this principle to include a graduated tax. Congress repealed the income tax in 1872, but the concept did not disappear.

Post Civil War
After the Civil War, the growing industrial and financial markets of the eastern United States generally prospered. But the farmers of the south and west suffered from low prices for their farm products, while they were forced to pay high prices for manufactured goods. Throughout the 1860s, 1870s, and 1880s, farmers formed such political organizations as the Grange, the Greenback Party, the National Farmers’ Alliance, and the People’s (Populist) Party. All of these groups advocated many reforms (see the Interstate Commerce Act) considered radical for the times, including a graduated income tax. 

Progressive Era
In 1894, as part of the Wilson-Gorman tariff bill, Congress enacted a 2-percent tax on income over $4,000. The tax in 1895 was struck down by a five-to-four decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. It held unconstitutional any direct tax by Congress on income.  A tax on income derived from property was a direct tax which Congress could impose only by the rule of apportionment according to population pursuant to Article I, Secs. 2 and 9 of the Constitution.  The Pollock decision was a surprise because merely 15 years earlier the Supreme Court had unanimously upheld a similar tax during the Civil War, the only other time that Congress had tried to tax income directly.
Although radicals denounced the Court’s decision as a prime example of the alliance of government and business against the farmer, a general return of prosperity around the turn of the century softened the demand for reform. Democratic Party Platforms under the leadership of three-time Presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan, however, consistently included an income tax plank, and the progressive wing of the Republican Party also espoused the concept.
After Pollock, the Court did uphold creative taxation by Congress based on a theory that they were levied on mere ""incidents of ownership"" and thus were constitutional excise taxes:  (1) an inheritance tax, (2) a tax affixing revenue stamps to memoranda for the sale of merchandise on commodity exchanges, (3) a war revenue tax upon tobacco being resold, and (4) a corporate income tax as an excise ""measured by income"" justified by the privilege of doing business in corporate form.

Comeback
The income tax, long a dream of progressives, was put on the back burner until a later date and more opportune time to try again.  As a few years went by, the popularity of taxing income gradually increased once more, and even was included as a topic in the 1907 State of the Union address of then president Theodore Roosevelt.[1]

Passage
In 1909 progressives in Congress, led by Republican Senator Nelson Aldrich, Republican of Rhode Island, proposed a constitutional amendment allowing an income tax.  President William Howard Taft gave an important speech in support of the effort on June 16, 1909.[2]  Shortly thereafter, a resolution proposing the 16th amendment was submitted on July 12, 1909.[3] The amendment was ratified by one state legislature after another, and on February 25, 1913, with the certification by Secretary of State Philander C. Knox, the 16th amendment took effect. The first income tax was passed in 1913 as part of the Underwood Tariff. Since the new tariff was lower, the government needed a way to replace the lost revenue. Due to generous exemptions and deductions, less than 1 percent of the population paid income taxes at the rate of only 1 percent of net income. However, during World War I the heavy cost of the war led to much higher rates; the rates were lowered in the 1920s.
The Sixteenth Amendment settled the constitutional question of permission to tax income and, by so doing, effected dramatic changes in the American way of life.  The states which ratified the amendment are as follows:[4]

 Alabama, August 17, 1909
 Kentucky, February 8, 1910
 South Carolina, February 23, 1910
 Illinois, March 1, 1910
 Mississippi, March 11, 1910

 South Dakota, February 3, 1912
 Arizona, April 9, 1912
 Minnesota, June 12, 1912
 Louisiana, July 1, 1912
 Delaware, February 3, 1913
 Wyoming, February 3, 1913
 New Jersey, February 5, 1913
 New Mexico, February 5, 1913
Three states rejected this amendment:

 Connecticut, September 27, 1911
 Rhode Island, April 29, 1910
 Utah, March 9, 1911
The remaining states ratified this amendment, after the necessary number was reached:  Vermont, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and West Virginia.

Repeal efforts
On April 13, 2000, an organization called We the People Foundation for Constitutional Education, Inc. sent delegates to Washington D.C. to argue that the 16th Amendment was not properly ratified. There are a number of questionable circumstances surrounding the ratification, including evidence that states which were claimed to have ratified it actually rejected it.

Text of the Congressional Resolution and the Sixteenth Amendment
Sixty-first Congress of the United States of America, At the First Session,
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Monday, the fifteenth day of March, one thousand nine hundred and nine.
JOINT RESOLUTION
Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States.
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each House concurring therein), That the following article is proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which, when ratified by the legislature of three-fourths of the several States, shall be valid to all intents and purposes as a part of the Constitution:

""ARTICLE XVI. The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.""

1990 Midterm Elections,https://www.conservapedia.com/1990_Midterm_Elections,"In the midterm elections of 1990, the Democratic Party gained 7-seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and one-seat in the U.S. Senate from the Republican Party, slightly increasing its already sizable majority. 
The campaign was dominated by crisis in Kuwait, a looming economic recession, and President George H.W. Bush's declining approval ratings. The results indicated an anti-incumbent mood, with six Democrats and nine Republicans in the House defeated for reelection. Minority Whip Newt Gingrich was barely reelected with 50% of the vote in his Georgia district. Notable freshmen included future Speaker of the House John Boehner of Ohio, Independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and Gary Franks of Connecticut, the first black Republican elected to the U.S. House since 1932.
Political science professor Paul Wellstone pulled a major upset by defeating well funded Republican Senator Rudy Boschwitz in Minnesota. Conservative Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina was narrowly reelected with 52% of the vote, after airing a controversial advertisement on racial quotas that featured a white man's hands ripping up a rejection letter from an employer. In New Jersey, Democratic Senator Bill Bradley faced a surprisingly close race against Republican Christine Todd Whitman, which helped propel her to being elected governor in 1993.

The Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous
We admitted we were powerless over alcohol—that our lives had become unmanageable.
Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.
Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him.
Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.
Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.
Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.
Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.
Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.
Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.
Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.
Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God, as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.
Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these Steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.

The inclusiveness and support of 12-step programs has led to the model (and the ""Anonymous"" name) being extended to other addictions, such as narcotics (""Narcotics Anonymous""), gambling (""Gamblers Anonymous""), food (""Overeaters Anonymous"") and illicit sex.

Higher Power
The ""higher power"" cited in Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12-step groups does not necessarily refer to God.  The phrase ""God as we understood Him"" allows members to choose other gods or ""powers"" to help them in their recovery.  However, the Christian foundation of A.A. is evident by the inclusion of several quotes from the bible in the book ""Alcoholics Anonymous"" and the use of the terms ""Father"" and ""Creator"" when referring to God.

Prayers of Alcoholics Anonymous
The Third Step Prayer
""God, I offer myself to Thee- to build with me and to do with me as Thou wilt.  Relieve me of the bondage of self that I may better do Thy will.  Take away my difficulties, that victory over them may bear witness to those I would help of Thy Power, Thy Love, and Thy Way of life.  May I do Thy will always!""
The Seventh Step Prayer
""My Creator, I am now willing that you should have all of me, good and bad.  I pray that you now remove from me every single defect of character that stands in the way of my usefulness to you and my fellows.  Grant me strength, as I go out from here, to do your bidding.  Amen.""
The Eleventh Step Prayer (The prayer of St. Francis of Assisi)
""Lord, make me a channel of thy peace - that where there is hatred, I may bring love- that where there is wrong, I may bring the spirit of forgiveness- that where there is discord, I may bring harmony- that where there is error, I may bring truth- that where there is doubt, I may bring faith- that where there is despair, I may bring hope- that where there are shadows, I may bring light- that where there is sadness, I may bring joy.  Lord grant that I may seek rather to comfort than to be comforted- to undersand than to be understood- to love, than to be loved.  For it is by self-forgetting that one finds.  It is by forgiving that one is forgiven.  It is by dying that one awakens to Eternal Life.  Amen""

Guiding Principles
The Twelve Traditions of Alcoholics Anonymous.

Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery depends upon A.A. unity.
For our group purpose there is but one ultimate authority - a loving God as He may express Himself in our group conscience. Our leaders are but trusted servants; they do not govern.
The only requirement for A.A. membership is a desire to stop drinking.
Each group should be autonomous except in matters affecting other groups or A.A. as a whole.
Each group has but one primary purpose-to carry its message to the alcoholic who still suffers.
An A.A. group ought never endorse, finance or lend the A.A. name to any related facility or outside enterprise, lest problems of money, property and prestige divert us from our primary purpose.
Every A.A. group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining outside contributions.
Alcoholics Anonymous should remain forever nonprofessional, but our service centers may employ special workers.
A.A., as such, ought never be organized; but we may create service boards or committees directly responsible to those they serve.
Alcoholics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues; hence the A.A. name ought never be drawn into public controversy.
Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than promotion; we need always maintain personal anonymity at the level of press, radio and films.
Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before personalities.

1970s,https://www.conservapedia.com/1970s,"The Seventies, or 1970s, similar to the 1960s, is widely celebrated by leftists and liberals as a decade of progress and freedom. In reality, however, it saw Western freedom and civilization demoralized and under the threat of World Communism, but ended with the rebirth of Conservative pride, with the emergence of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan among the great world leaders of the 20th Century.

The Threat
The early Seventies saw the West demoralized and uncertain. The United States was traumatized by the Watergate affair and America's premature withdrawal from Vietnam led to Communist victories across Indo-China. This feeling of demoralization led to the election in 1976 of President Jimmy Carter, at the time the most liberal of all US presidents. Carter's presidency saw betrayal of US foreign policy: pro-American regimes in Latin America were abandoned, the Panama Canal was abandoned, the fight against Communism in other parts of the world such as Africa was abandoned in favor of a woolly-minded policy of detente towards the USSR (appeasement by another name) and, the pro-Western government and Shah of Iran were abandoned to the forces of Islamofascism, with results which reverberate today. The Iran Hostage Crisis was perhaps the lowest point of American foreign policy in this period.
Britain was becoming ""the sick man of Europe"", as power seemingly slipped from elected institutions to unelected, and often communist-dominated, trade unions. Strikes became more frequent and damaging to the economy, already under strain due to rising oil costs, the legacy of the 1973 Yom Kippur War. The efforts of Edward Heath to control the unions failed when he lost a general election in 1974; the subsequent Labour Party government, led by Harold Wilson and from 1976 by James Callaghan, routinely caved in to union demands.
The Soviet Union built up its influence worldwide, by bribery or subversion, taking advantage of Western liberal decrepitude, it established important bases in Indo-China, the Horn of Africa. It also had influence in Somalia, Ethiopia, Angola. and Mozambique.

The Resurgence
Demoralization and disillusionment with political leadership can only go so far before the people stand up. In 1975 Margaret Thatcher replaced the discredited Edward Heath as leader of the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom. Her tough, trenchant speeches and policies governing domestic and foreign policy swiftly struck a chord with the British people - and further afield. The Soviet media began referring to her as the 'Iron Lady' - intended as an insult, it betrayed their fear of strong Western leadership. In a similar manner, the weak and vacillating policies of Jimmy Carter stirred the American people into finding a proper American leader; and they found one in the person of Ronald Reagan. Although he was only elected after the decade had ended, his presence and personality dominated the final period of the Carter Presidency and set the scene for the years to come.
In China, the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 heralded the end of the catastrophic cultural revolution. The new leadership began the process of economic reform which has led to modern China, while a dictatorship ruled by the Communist Party, nevertheless having achieved economic and material growth unthinkable under a socialist straitjacket. The Chinese people have economic freedom as a result of the changes begun in the 1970s; political and religious freedom will inevitably follow.
On Christmas in 1979 the geriatric leadership of the Soviet Union launched an invasion of Afghanistan. Although they succeeded in occupying the country, this act of aggression was to embroil them in a war of resistance that bled their armed forces white and sparked the process that led to the collapse of the USSR itself and of world Communism.

2010 Midterm Election,https://www.conservapedia.com/2010_Midterm_Election," In the 2010 Midterm Elections, the Republican Party gained 63 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and six seats in the U.S. Senate from the Democratic Party. Republicans also gained six governorships, including Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan.  Republicans gained 680 seats in state legislatures, the most in the modern era.[1]
Republicans gained the most House seats since the 1938 Midterm Elections, giving Republicans their biggest House majority, and Democrats their smallest minority, since 1946.  When blue dog Democrats are added to the Republicans on certain issues like gun control or marriage, the Republican majority is even greater than in 1946.
Democratic loses could be attributed to public rejection of the socialistic policies of the Obama administration. The public disapproved of President Obama's economic policies. In the days leading up to the election, a majority of voters supported repealing/replacing The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, sixty-five percent of voters said that the economic stimulus package either hurt the economy or did no good,[2] and fifty-four percent of those voting said they were dissatisfied with the performance of Barack Obama. Given the high level of Democratic success in the 2006 and 2008 elections, they were also put in the position of having to defend a large number of seats.
John Boehner (R-Ohio), become Speaker of the House in the 112th Congress, exchanging places with Nancy Pelosi (D-California). By tradition Pelosi would be expected to resign her leadership position after such a stunning repudiation by the electorate, but as a self-centered liberal she insisted on becoming the next Minority Leader.

2009 elections
In the Nov. 3, 2009, off-year elections, defeat was the fate of Democrats in New York City, New Jersey and Virginia. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent, spent his way to a third term in New York City while Republican Bob McDonnell won in a landslide for governor of Virginia; in New Jersey Republican Christopher Christie ousted the incumbent Democrat Jon Corzine despite his millions and Obama's campaigning.
Conservatives scored a major internal party victory in Oct. 2009 by forcing the Republican candidate Dede Scozzafava out of a House race in New York's 23rd district, for being too liberal. The Conservative Party candidate was defeated by the Democrat, however, opening up recriminations between GOP officials and conservatives on why the district was lost for the first time since 1992. Conservative activists zeroed in on the 2010 race for Florida's open Senate seat, in which the Republican party Senate campaign committee endorsed moderate Gov. Charlie Crist but the more conservative Marco Rubio mounted a successful challenge. ""If I were Charlie Crist in Florida, what's happening in New York 23 would make me extremely nervous,"" GOP strategist Todd Harris said. ""A lot of the establishment Republicans underestimated the grass-roots anger across the country about spending and the expansion of the federal government. The anger is boiling over now, but a lot of the seeds of discontent were planted over the last five to six years.""[3]

Ad campaigns
 Cartoonist Michael Ramirez of Investor's Business Daily captures the tone of the 2010 Midterm elections.
In late 2009 national money was being poured into nine districts, where Democrats who voted for their party's health care reform may be in trouble. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, representing business, has spent at least $1.6 million in November.  Liberals shoot back against the Chamber and 60 Plus Association with ads targeting 12 Democrats and one Republican who supported health reform. Three liberal groups, Americans United for Change and the labor unions AFSCME and SEIU are teaming up for $1.75 million worth of counter-messaging on broadcast and cable TV in the districts of Reps. Berry, Cao, Connolly, Donnelly, Ellsworth, Hill, Hodes, Michaud, Murphy, Perriello, Pomeroy, Snyder and Titus.
In mid-October the Democratic National Committee, echoing charges debunked[4] by the New York Times, insinuated that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce was using ""foreign money"" to fund ads criticizing Democrats. The president said in a Maryland stump speech, ""we learned that one of the largest groups paying for these ads regularly takes in money from foreign corporations. So groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence American elections, and they won't tell you where the money for their ads comes from…. This is a threat to our democracy."" 
The president himself has received $543,219 from Swiss banking giant UBS AG,[5] a foreign banking corporation which was later fined a record $780 million for its part in helping the rich evade U.S. income taxes.[6] Columnist Ruben Navarrette warned the pitfalls of playing the ""foreign card"" is



 “

 both offensive and dangerous. It exploits people's fears of the unknown and appeals to the prejudice that many of us feel toward those who are different. It also fuels ugly nativist instincts that -- once unleashed -- can do real damage....Democrats know this better than anyone ... The birther movement, which suggests that Obama was actually born in Kenya and thus not eligible to serve as a president, is all about playing the foreign card...[7]

 ”


Commentator Charles Krauthammer called the unfounded attacks on the Chamber of Commerce a baseless McCarthyite smear,[8] while columinst Jacob Sullum wrote,



 “

 Obama's attempt to discredit his opponents by linking them to sinister outsiders reminds us that neither major party has a monopoly on xenophobia. To some extent, crying ""foreigner"" reflects the president's desperation in the face of the Democrats' looming midterm losses.[9]

 ”


Pre-election Forecasts
In recent years, as the chart shows, the incumbent party loses an average of 16 House seats.  The GOP needed 39 seats to win back the House.  
Democrats had to defend about 60 marginal House seats in 2010, as opposed to about 40 for Republicans. At high risk were 27 Democratic seats and just 13 Republican seats that may see a party switch.
Election forecasters in September 2009 were revising their predictions downward for the Democrats, as Obama's popularity continues to plunge. From April to August, Obama lost 10 points across the board—suffering losses in every group except blacks, who remain loyal to him.[10] The popularity of Congress remains low. Starting in January 2010 the number of Americans who identify themselves as Democrats was at a seven-year low.[11] The Republican party, however, suffers from a lack of leaders and its own poor reputation in voter esteem.
""No question, August proved cathartic for voters and chaotic for congressional Democrats. But way before the town hall meetings during recess, there were ample signs for Democrats to fear for their careers in 2010,"" concluded Cook Political Report House analyst David Wasserman, who predicts the Democrats will lose 20 seats in the House, but retain control.[12]  Wasserman concludes that a major shift has been underway among ""angry white seniors"" (over age 60), who strongly dislike the Obama health care proposals because they fear they will lose benefits they now have. 
Analyst Stuart Rothenberg reported that, ""Growing public concern about spending, taxes and the size of government has started to shift the national landscape away from the Democrats to a more neutral position, and quite possibly toward the GOP.""[13] Furthermore, an advantage for Republicans was that 48 House Democrats, 8 more than the size of their majority, come from districts that voted for both George W. Bush and John McCain.[14]
Columnist Rich Galen observed,



 “

 He railroaded his signature legislation - Obamacare - through the Congress costing his party 60+ seats in the 2010 mid-term election and guaranteeing GOP control of the House for the foreseeable future. Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi will go down in history as enablers of the sacrifice of Obama's Congressional allies on the alter of his enormous ego.[15]

Senate
Texas Senator John Cornyn, the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, quietly put Senate Republicans in a position to benefit as the national political environment went negative toward Democrats, and was successful in narrowing the Democratic majority. Without losing any of their seats, the Republican Party defeated two incumbents, Blanche Lincoln (D-Arkansas) and Russ Feingold (D-Wisconsin), and won four Democratic-held open seats: Illinois, Indiana, North Dakota, and Pennsylvania. Additionally, Republican Scott Brown was elected to replace the late Senator Ted Kennedy (D-Massachusetts) in a January special election.  

Republican Gains
Arkansas
Moderate Democrat Blanche Lincoln was defeated by 21 percentage points after Republicans made her one of their top targets in 2010. In the 2008 Presidential Election, Arkansas was one of the few states where John McCain exceeded George W. Bush’s margin, despite the national trend favoring Democrats. Generally, she voted the party line with President Obama, which angered her conservative constituents, but also voted against the Employee Free Choice Act (card check) and opposed to the public option in health care, which angered liberals. She began airing TV ads in March touting her independence from President Obama and national Democrats. Lincoln defeated Lieutenant Governor Bill Halter in a close runoff for the Democratic nomination.
Third district Congressman John Boozman easily won the Republican nomination, defeating State Senator Gilbert Baker and former State Senator Jim Holt. Boozman comfortably led thoughout the entire campaign.

Indiana
Two-term Democrat Evan Bayh dropped out of his reelection in February after polls showed he may be vulnerable after his vote for the economic stimulus package and government-run health care. Former Republican U.S. Senator Dan Coats, who predeced Bayh after retiring in 1998, announced his candidacy for his old Senate seat. Former six-term Congressman John Hostettler, State Senator Marlin Stutzman and businessman Don Bates Jr. were defeated for the Republican nomination. Conservative Congressman Mike Pence considered running, but instead chose to seek reelection in the House.
8th district Congressman Brad Ellsworth was the Democratic nominee. Dan Coats defeated Ellsworth by a 55%-40% margin. Ellsworth supported President Obama’s health care plan in a state where opposition to the legislation is higher than it was nationally.[16]

Illinois
Democratic Senator Roland Burris had been plagued by controversies. Burris was appointed to replace Barack Obama by Governor Rod Blagojevich, who had been arrested on a variety of federal corruption charges (including for trying to ""sell"" Obama's Senate seat). Burris was then accused of committing perjury after he admitted to not testifying truthfully at a committee investigating Governor Blagojevich. Burris announced he would not seek a full term in 2010.
Moderate-GOP Congressman Mark Kirk, representing a Democratic-leaning district that covers suburban Chicago, easily won the Republican nomination, while Illinois State Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias defeated Chicago Inspector General David Hoffman in a close primary. Both candidates faced negative media publicity, Giannoulias for the collapse of his family bank, and Kirk for exaggerating his military record. In the general election, Kirk defeated Giannoulias by a 48%-46% margin.

Massachusetts
Republican State Senator Scott Brown pulled a major upset when he defeated Attorney General Martha Coakley by a 52%-47% margin.
Liberal icon Ted Kennedy, the third longest-serving Senator in U.S. history, died in August 2009, marking the end of an era. During the 2004 Presidential Election the Democratic super-majority in the state legislator blocked the right of Republican Governor Mitt Romney to appoint an interim senator had John Kerry been elected President. After changing the law to allow Governor Deval Patrick, a Democrat, the right to appoint a temporary replacement for Kennedy, he choose former Democratic National Committee chairman Paul Kirk. He did not seek a full term of his own, and a special election was held on January 19, 2010. 
State Attorney General Martha Coakley won the Democratic primary, defeating businessman Alan Khazei, Representative Mike Capuano, and Boston Celtics co-owner Stephen Pagliuca. Charismatic State Senator Scott Brown was the Republican nominee.[17]

 a last minute appeal
It was a safe Democratic seat until January, when Democrats reeled in shock as Coakley lost her 30-point lead and trailed by 5-10 points in the closing hours. Coakley was an ineffective machine-style insider candidate who was unable to reach independents. Brown's main theme was that he would be the 41st senator and would block the Obama health care plan—which Massachusetts did not need, he explained, because it had its own plan in operation. Coakley responded by attacking bankers and bringing in big guns like Bill Clinton, John Kerry and Barack Obama. They appealed to regular Democrats and alienated the equally numerous independents, who preferred Brown by more than 2-1. 
The defeat for Coakley, coming on the heels of the Democrats' loss of Virginia and New Jersey in Nov. 2009, was a major blow to the liberal caused and reinvigorated the Republican party nationally.

North Dakota
Byron Dorgan, a three-term Democrat Senator from North Dakota, announced he would not seek reelection. Dorgan's announcement represented an opportunity for Republicans, after popular Governor John Hoeven announced his candidacy.[18] Hoeven defeated State Senator Tracy Potter by a 76%-22% margin, carrying every county.

Pennsylvania
After polls showed him losing the Republican primary by as much as 20 points, Arlen Specter simply changed party affiliation to Democrat. Despite full support by President Obama and virtually every elected Democrat in Pennsylvania as well as nearly every major newspaper, Specter went on to lose the Democratic nomination to 7th-district Congressman Joe Sestak in the primary, and faced former 15th district Congressman and Club for Growth President Pat Toomey, known for his economic conservatism. In the general election, Toomey defeated Sestak by a 51%-49% margin.

Wisconsin
Three-term incumbent Russ Feingold had positioned himself for a comfortable reelection after former governor and Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson announced he would not run. However, Tea Party activist and Oshkosh businessman Ron Johnson defeated Feingold by a 52%-47% margin.

Democratic Holds
California
Although California is a solidly Democratic state, conservatives originally saw outspoken liberal Senator Barbara Boxer as vulnerable. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was term-limited in 2010, announced he would not run. Former Hewlett-Packard Company President Carly Fiorina defeated former U.S. Rep. Tom Campbell and Assemblyman Chuck DeVore in the Republican primary. Boxer defeated Fiorina by ten percentage points.

Colorado
Appointed Democratic Senator Michael Bennet was narrowly reelected. Former Speaker of the Colorado House of Representatives Andrew Romanoff was defeated in his bid to challenge Bennet for the Democratic nomination, while Weld County District Attorney Ken Buck defeated former Lieutenant Governor Jane Norton in the Republican primary. 

Connecticut
30-year Senate veteran Chris Dodd announced he would not seek a sixth term. Dodd's approval ratings plummeted after his failed presidential campaign in 2008, his controversial mortgage deal from Countrywide, and revelations about the $165 million bonuses for AIG executives that he attached in an amendment to the economic stimulus package, despite receiving federal bailout money. Popular state Attorney General Richard Blumenthal won the Democratic nomination, increasing the Democrats' chances of holding the seat. However, his poll numbers dropped after a New York Times report revealed that he exaggerated his military record.
Republicans nominated World Wrestling Entertainment CEO Linda McMahon, defeating former Congressman Rob Simmons and libertarian-leaning economist Peter Schiff, a stock broker and adviser to Ron Paul’s 2008 presidential campaign. Blumenthal won the general election by a 55%-43% margin.

Delaware
Joe Biden was simultaneously elected to a seventh term in the Senate and Vice President at the same time. Democratic Governor Ruth Ann Minner appointed a ""caretaker"" Senator, Ted Kaufman. Michael Castle, a moderate Republican who also served as Governor and Lieutenant Governor, was heavily favored to win the Republican nomination. However, Tea Party backed insurgent Christine O’Donnell ousted Castle in the primary, improving New Castle County Executive Chris Coons chances in holding the seat for Democrats. The Republican Party had a mixed reaction to O’Donnell's victory. She had caused controversy regarding her views on creationism and Christian values. Coons defeated O’Donnell by a 57%-40% margin.

Hawaii
Democrat Daniel Inouye easily won reelection against Republican Representative Campbell Cavasso.

Maryland
Entrenched incumbent Barbara Mikulski easily won reelection, defeating physician and Queen Anne's County Commissioner Eric Wargotz.

Nevada
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid faced a competitive reelection in 2010. The ""Cook Political Report"" in September 2009 rateed the contest as ""Toss Up."" His status weakened in summer 2009, as discontent with President Obama and the Democrats' health plan mounted, and as the Recession of 2008 continues to batter Las Vegas and the entire Nevada economy, with no relief in sight from the stimulus bill Reid pushed through the Senate. Reid's inability to improve his standing in the polls, coupled with the deteriorating political environment for Democrats nationally, were clear indications that his political problems are deep and will be difficult (though not impossible) to fix, says Cook. 
After receiving the endorsement of the Tea Party Express and Club for Growth, former Assemblywoman Sharron Angle defeated former State Senator Sue Lowden and businessman Danny Tarkanian in the Republican primary. Reid defeated Angle by a 50%-45% margin.

New York
Senior Senator Charles Schumer was considered the safest incumbent of 2010 and won his reelection by a 66%-33% margin against Republican Jay Townsend.

New York-Special Election
Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand was appointed by Governor David Patterson to replace Hillary Clinton after much confusion on his part. Patterson mishandled the proposed appointment of Caroline Kennedy, gaining ridicule for both of them.  Gillibrand's moderate views alienated the left wing of the Democratic Party. Former Tennessee Congressman Harold Ford, Jr. has announced he will not seek a primary challenge to Gillibrand.
Nine-term Congressman Peter King has declined to run. Republicans are tried but failed to recruit former Governor George Pataki, who ran ahead in the polls with Gillibrand. Real estate billionaire Mort Zuckerman, despite having a record of supporting liberal causes, was mentioned as a possible Republican or Independent candidate to avoid a primary, however announced that he would not run. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani declined to seek the Senate seat.[19] Instead, Republicans nominated former Congressman Joseph DioGuardi, whom Gillibrand defeated by a 62%-36% margin.

Oregon
Democratic Senator Ron Wyden defeated his Republican challenger, Lewis & Clark College law professor Jim Huffman by a 57%-39% margin. 

Vermont
Patrick Leahy, the third most senior U.S. Senator, was reelected by a 64%-40% margin against Republican Len Britton.

Washington
Polls show that Senator Patty Murray, once considered well positioned for reelection, would face a competitive race against Washington's former state Senator, Dino Rossi. In November, Murray defeated Rossi by a 52%-48% margin.

West Virginia
Popular Democratic Governor Joe Manchin was elected to replace the late Exalted Cyclops Senator Robert Byrd. Businessman and 2006 nominee John Raese made the race surprisingly close by tying Manchin to the Obama administration.

Republican Holds
Alabama
Senior Senator Richard Shelby, who was originally elected as a conservative Democrat but changed party affiliation to Republican after the 1994 Republican Revolution, was handedly reelected, as he was in 1992, 1998, and 2004. 

Alaska 
Lisa Murkowski won a term for the U.S. Senate in her own right in 2004 by a close 48%-45% margin, however, in 2010 she lost the Primary Election against Joe Miller, a Conservative candidate and Tea Party favorite. Democrats nominated Sitka, Alaska Mayor Scott McAdams. Murkowski pursued her campaign as a write-in candidate, and was reelected with a 39% plurality, while Miller received 35% and McAdams 23%. She has the distinction of being the first person elected to the Senate via write-in since Strom Thurmond in 1954. 

Arizona
Senior Senator John McCain, the Republicans presidential nominee in 2008, caught a break when Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano was appointed Secretary of Homeland Security. However, former Congressman J. D. Hayworth challenged McCain in a primary, but was defeated by a 56%-32% margin. McCain went on to defeat Tucson City Councilor Rodney Glassman by a 59%-35% margin. 

Florida
Republican Governor Charlie Crist, who once enjoyed high approval ratings, appointed George LeMieux upon the resignation of Senator Mel Martinez. LeMieux held the seat temporarily for Governor Crist who decided to run for the Senate. He was the establishment pick for the Republican nomination, but was challenged by conservative Florida House Speaker and Tea Party backed candidate Marco Rubio, who led by 32 points according to Public Policy Polling.[20] Crist announced he would drop out of the Republican primary and run as an Independent. 
Crist alienated conservatives when he campaigned with President Obama in support for the $787 billion economic stimulus package, which was entirely opposed by the Florida Republican federal delegation. Democrats nominated 17th district Congressman Kendrick Meek, who defeated billionaire businessman Jeff Greene. Rubio was elected with a 49% plurality, defeating Crist who received 30% and Meek who received 20%. 

Georgia
First-term Senator Johnny Isakson's had solid standing for his reelection. His most formidable Democratic opponent, state Attorney General Thurbert Baker, instead sought a campaign for Governor. Isakson defeated Labor Commissioner Mike Thurmond by a 58%-39% margin.

Idaho
Mike Crapo's conservative voting record goes along with the Republican stronghold of Idaho. In 2004, he faced no Democratic challenger and won reelection with over 99% of the vote. Crapo's seat was one of the safest in the 2010 election cycle, and he won reelection by a 71%-25% margin.

Iowa
30-year incumbent Charles Grassley is one of the most distinguished and influential Republican Senators in Washington (he serves as ranking member of the Finance Committee). He was reelected by a 65%-33% margin against former U.S. Attorney Roxanne Conlin, carrying all but one county.

Kansas
Incumbent Republican Sam Brownback honored his campaign pledge to serve only two terms. 1st district Congressman Jerry Moran defeated 4th district Congressman Todd Tiahrt for the Republican nomination by a 50%-45% margin, while Democrats nominated Lisa Johnston, an administrator at Baker University.

Kentucky
Republicans had a victory when unpopular incumbent Senator Jim Bunning announced he would not seek a third term. Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson sought the Republican nomination, however was defeated by Tea Party activist Rand Paul, an eye surgeon who is the son of Texas Congressman Ron Paul. Paul received the endorsment of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin.[21] On the Democratic side, Lieutenant Governor Daniel Mongiardo (who lost to Bunning in 2004) was defeated by Attorney General Jack Conway. Paul campaigned on a reducation in taxion and spending, and won the support of conservatives and libertarians alike. Paul defeated Conway by a 56%-44% margin.

Louisiana
Louisiana, a conservative state, was not effected by the national trend for Democrats in 2006 and 2008. Republican Bobby Jindal was elected Governor by a landslide in 2007, in 2008 John McCain received a larger margin of victory in the state than George W. Bush in 2004, while the GOP gained two House seats from the Democrats. Yet first-term Republican David Vitter was considered to be vulnerable for his reelection after he confessed in 2007 to seeing an escort service, which has tainted his career. Third-district Congressman Charlie Melancon won the Democratic nomination. Vitter defeated Melancon by a 57%-38% margin.

Missouri
Incumbent Republican Senator Kit Bond announced he will not seek fifth term. Former House Majority Whip Roy Blunt announced his candidacy. Blunt benefited from strong fundraising numbers and President Obama's dismal approval ratings in Missouri. Secretary of State Robin Carnahan won the Democratic nomination. BLunt defeated Carnahan by a 54%-41% margin.

New Hampshire
Senior Republican Senator Judd Gregg, after withdrawing from a position in the Obama administration, announced he will not seek a fourth term. 2nd district Congressman Paul Hodes won the Democratic nomination, while Republicans nominated former New Hampshire Attorney General Kelly Ayotte. Ayotte defeated Hodes by a 60%-37% margin.

North Carolina
First-term Republican Richard Burr was considered vulnerable after Barack Obama won North Carolina's 15 electoral votes by a narrow margin, and Democrat Kay Hagan defeated Republican Senator Elizabeth Dole. It is also worth noting that no Senator has held this seat for more than one term since 1974. Secretary of State Elaine Marshall defeated former State Senator Cal Cunningham and Attorney Ken Lewis in the Democratic primary. Burr was reelected by a 55%-43% margin.

Ohio
Moderate Republican George Voinovich announced he would not seek a third term. Lieutenant Governor Lee Fisher won the Democratic nomination over Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner with 55% of the vote, a much closer margin than polls had shown.[22] Fisher received the endorsement of Democratic Governor Ted Strickland. Meanwhile, Republicans rallied behind Rob Portman, former Congressman and Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Although polls originally showed a tight race, Portman defeated Fisher by a 57%-39% margin.

Oklahoma
Tom Coburn was elected to a second term by a 71%-26% margin against Democrat Jim Rogers.

South Carolina
First-term Republican Jim DeMint, whose reputation as an outspoken conservative, has not hurt him in the Republican stronghold of South Carolina. Democrats nominated an unconventional candidate, Alvin Greene, an unemployed Army veteran who was indicted on criminal charges for showing pornographic pictures to a teenage college student.[23] DeMint defeated Greene by a 61%-28% margin.  

South Dakota
In 2004, John Thune defeated Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, and his victory quickly made him a rising star in the Republican Party. Thune ran unopposed in his reelection.[24]

Utah 
Three-term Senator Robert Bennett represents a state that John McCain won by over thirty-percentage points and was expected to win reelection by a comfortable margin. However, he was defeated in the Republican caucus to Mike Lee and Tim Bridgewater after his vote for TARP. Bennett ruled out a write-in campaign, and Lee went on to win the Republican primary and general election.

Governors
In the 2010 gubernatorial elections, the Democratic Party won five governorships held by retiring Republicans: California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Minnesota, and Vermont. The Republican Party won nine governorships from retiring Democrats: Kansas, Oklahoma, Maine, Michigan, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Wisconsin, Wyoming, and defeated two incumbents, Chet Culver of Iowa and Ted Strickland of Ohio. An Independent was elected Governor of Rhode Island to replace a retiring Republican, and a Republican was elected Governor of Florida to replace an Independent. Thus, Republicans had a net gain of six governorships, and the majority of Governors in the United States flipped from Democrat to Republican. Republicans also won the governorships of New Jersey and Virginia from the Democrats in the 2009 elections.

Democratic Gains
California
Incumbent Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger was prohibited from seeking reelection because of term-limits. Schwarzenegger was elected in 2003 after a recall of Governor Gray Davis and reelected in a landslide in 2006. However, Schwarzenegger's popularity, along with the Democratic assembly, fell because of the California budget crisis. State Attorney General and former Governor Jerry Brown won the Democratic nomination. On the Republican side, former Ebay CEO Meg Whitman defeated State Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner.
San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom was seeking the Democratic nomination, however dropped out in October 2009 after lackluster poll numbers and meager fund-raising receipts.[25] In the general election, Brown defeated Whitman by a 53%-42% margin.

Connecticut
M. Jodi Rell, despite being a Republican Governor from a blue state, was reelected with 63% of the vote in 2006 and had high approval ratings throughout her tenure as governor. However, she announced she would not run for another term.[26] Lieutenant Governor Michael Fedele announced his candidacy, but was defeated for the Republican nomination by former U.S. Ambassador Tom Foley. Democrats chose Stamford Mayor Dan Malloy over former U.S. Senate candidate Ned Lamont. After a recount, Malloy was confirmed to have won the governorship by a 50%-49% margin.

Hawaii 
Republican Governor Linda Lingle was term-limited. James Aiona, who served as the state's Lieutenant Governor eight years, ran to become her successor, but was defeated by 10-term Congressman Neil Abercrombie by a 58%-41% margin.

Minnesota
Two-term Governor Tim Pawlenty announced he would not seek another term, and became a potential 2012 GOP presidential candidate. Republican State Representative Tom Emmer and former Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Dayton won their parties nominations, respectively. After a recount, Dayton was confirmed to have won by a 0.5% margin.  

Vermont
Although a solidly Democratic state (Barack Obama won it with over 67% of the vote) Republican Jim Douglas was elected governor in 2002 and reelected in 2004, 2006, and 2008. Douglas announced he would not run for another term, and Republicans nominated Lieutenant Governor Brian Dubie. Democratic State Senator Peter Shumlin defeated Dubie by a 50%-48% margin in the general election.

Independent Gains
Rhode Island
Although Democrats have dominated Rhode Island politics, they have voted Republican for 7 of the last 10 gubernatorial elections. As Rhode Island was hit hard by the national recession, Republican Governor Donald Carcieri suffered in the polls, and was barred from seeking a third term because of term-limits. Lincoln Chafee, former Senator who was known as the most liberal Republican in Congress, was elected Governor as an Independent, defeating Republican John Robitaille and Democrat Frank Caprio. After President Obama refused to endorse Caprio, he caused controversy by telling Obama to take his endorsement and ""shove it."" [27]

Republican Gains
Florida
Republican turned Independent Governor Charlie Crist announced he would not seek a second term and instead run for the United States Senate, resulting in an open race. State Attorney General Bill McCollum was heavily favored to win the Republican nomination, but was defeated by Rick Scott, a millionaire health care executive and activist against federal health care legislation. Democrats nominated Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink, who led Scott in most of the polls following the primary. Scott's campaign emphasized conservative policies such as expanding school choice, abolishing the corporate income tax, and firing state employees.[28] He won the general election by a narrow 49%-48% margin. 

Iowa
Chet Culver, who was elected governor in 2006 riding on a Democratic wave, was defeated in a competitive reelection. Culver governed as a progressive in a swing state, increasing the minimum wage and raising the cigarette tax. His job approval ratings fell as the economy continued to falter. Former Governor Terry Branstad defeated Culver by a 53%-43% margin.

Kansas
Kathleen Sebelius, a Democratic Governor from the Republican-stronghold of Kansas, stepped down after being nominated to serve as Secretary of Health and Human Services in the Obama administration. Lieutenant Governor Mark Parkinson, a former Republican, took her place, and announced he would not seek a full term. Senator Sam Brownback was the Republican nominee, and defeated Democratic state Senator Tom Holland by a 63%-32% margin.

Maine
Democrat Governor John Baldacci was term-limited by state law, and Republicans saw it as an opportunity to gain the governorship. Republicans nominated Waterville, Maine Mayor Paul LePage, who defeated Independent candidate Eliot Cutler and Democratic state Senate President Libby Mitchell with a 38% plurarly. 

Michigan
Democratic Governor Jennifer Granholm suffered in her job approval ratings as the Michigan economy, heavily dependent of the auto industry, continued to falter throughout the 2000s. She was legally barred from seeking a third-term under state law. The Republican nominee, former President and COO of Gateway, Inc. Rick Snyder, easily defeated Democrat Lansing Mayor Virgil Bernero by a 58%-40% margin in the general election.

New Mexico
Democratic Governor Bill Richardson was nominated by President Obama to serve as Secretary of Commerce, however was forced to resign after it was exposed that his administration had a ""pay-to-play"" deal with a defense contractor. Richardson denied any wrongdoing. Although he was popular for most of his tenure, and handedly reelected in 2006, his approval ratings fell to 28% as the economy declined.[29] As he was term-limited in 2010, Lieutenant Governor Diane Denish won the Democratic Party nomination. The Republican nomination went to District Attorney Susana Martinez, and narrowly led in the polls throughout the campaign. She defeated Denish by a 54%-46% margin, becoming the first Hispanic woman elected governor in the United States. 

Ohio
Incumbent Democrat Ted Strickland faced sagging approval ratings and tough reelection prospects as Ohio lost jobs and population during his governorship. His Republican opponent, John Kasich – a former Congressman and Chairman of the House Budget Committee in the 1990s – campaigned on phasing out the state income tax, leasing the state's toll roads, cutting 15-20 percent of the state's higher education funds, and relaxing sentences on nonviolent offenders to cut down prison costs.[30] He defeated Strickland by a 49%-47% margin.

Oklahoma
Democratic Governor Brad Henry could not run for reelection because of term limits. Republicans nominated U.S. Representative Marry Fallin, who defeated Lieutenant Governor Jari Askins, becoming the first woman elected governor of Oklahoma.

Pennsylvania
Democratic Governor Ed Rendell was term limited in 2010. Democrats nominated Allegheny County Chief Executive Dan Onorato.

Democratic Holds
Arkansas
Centrist Democrat Mike Beebe enjoyed high approval ratings throughout his tenure as Governor. He was reelected by a 65%-34% margin against former Republican State Senate Jim Keet, despite Republicans making strong inroads in the traditionally Democratic supporting Arkansas during the 2010 election.

Colorado 
Despite Democratic success in Colorado during the 2006 and 2008 elections, incumbent Governor Bill Ritter announced his retirement after the prospects of a difficult reelection. His policies of higher taxes and unionization of state employees earned him criticism from the business community, and his approval ratings fell to 45%.[31] Former Congressman Scott McInnis was favored to win the Republican nomination, however fell in the polls after a controversy regarding plagiarizing an article, and was defeated by businessman and political newcomer Dan Maes, who also received criticism for misrepresenting his law enforcement background in the 1980s. Meanwhile, former Congressman Tom Tancredo entered the race in the American Constitution Party, and surged towards the end of the campaign. The turmoil made is easier for Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper to hold the Governors office for the Democrats, and was elected 50% of the vote, to Tancredo's 37% and Maes 11%.

Illinois
Democratic Governor Pat Quinn was installed as governor after the impeachment of Rod Blagojevich, and announced he would seek a full term. Quinn narrowly won the Democratic nomination against State Comptroller Dan Hynes. State Senator Bill Brady won the Republican nomination, defeating State Senator Kirk Dillard, and former State GOP chair Andrew McKenna. In the general election, Quinn pulled somewhat of an upset, winning reelection by a 47%-46% margin.  

Maryland
Democrat Martin O'Malley will likely run for a second term in 2010. O'Malley's approval ratings fell to 33% after a series of tax increases. The race was expected to be competitive with former Governor Robert Ehrlich seeking a rematch, however O'Malley was reelected by 14 percentage points.    

Massachusetts
Deval Patrick, although a Democratic Governor from a blue state, faced a difficult reelection after a disappointing performance as governor. The Republican nominee was health care executive Charlie Baker. Patrick was reelected with a 48% plurality, with Baker receiving 42% and Independent Paul Loscocco 8%.

New York
After Democratic Governor Eliot Spitzer resigned in disgrace when it was revealed that he was involved in a prostitution ring, Lieutenant Governor David Paterson took office. Governor Paterson's approval ratings plummeted to 21% [32] after his handling of the state budget crisis, his mismanagement of filling in the appointment of Hillary Clinton's vacant Senate seat, and a proposed number of tax increases. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani declined to seek the governorship and endorsed former Congressman Rick Lazio. 
President Barack Obama in Sept. 2009 contacted Paterson, asking him not to seek reelection in 2010 in that he cannot recover from his dismal political standing. Democrats nominated a stronger candidate, State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo. Republicans nominated Tea Party favorite and real estate developer Carl Paladino. Polls originally showed a tightening race, however a series of missteps resulted in Cuomo being handedly elected with over 60-percent of the vote.  

Oregon

Alaska
Sarah Palin, one-term Governor and former Vice-Presidential nominee, resigned on July 3, 2009 and Lieutenant Governor Sean Parnell inherited the governorship. Although Democrats nominated a formidable challenger, former State House Minority Leader Ethan Berkowitz, Parnell was elected to a full term by a 59%-38% margin.  

Arizona 
After Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano was nominated by President Obama to serve as Secretary of Homeland Security, Arizona Secretary of State Janice K. Brewer, a Republican, succeeded her. She announced that she would seek a full term.[33] In the beginning of 2010, Brewer was considered to be one of the most vulnerable Republican Governors up for reelection. However, her popularity rose after signing a controversial illegal immigration law, and was reelected against state Attorney General Terry Goddard by a 55%-42% margin.

Georgia
In 2002, Sonny Perdue became the first Republican elected Governor of Georgia since reconstruction, and was reelected in 2006. However, he was term-limited in 2010.

Gibbons was vulnerable for his reelection after a series of scandals in his administration, a messy divorce and lawsuit, his failure to examine the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste site, and his handling of the budget, brought his approval ratings down. Clark County Commissioner Rory Reid — son of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid - won the Democratic nomination. In the general election, Sandovalby defeated Reid by a 53%-42% margin.   

South Carolina
Republican Governor Mark Sanford's possible presidential ambitions for 2012 ended after it was exposed he was having an extramarital affair with a woman from Argentine. Sanford would not resign, however was barred from seeking a third term because of term limits. Both parties prepared for an open race. State Representative Nikki Haley defeated Congressman Gresham Barrett in the Republican primary. State Senator Vincent Sheheen won the Democratic nomination.

Differences between 2008 and other elections
In 2008, CNN-YouTube held the first debate in which the questions asked of the nominees in each party came primarily from YouTube viewer submitted videos. The debates received high ratings, however, CNN was criticized for not picking questions that were 'tough' or pertinent enough. One such example was during the Democratic Debate, when CNN chose to ask a question from a snow man, talking about global warming. During the Republican debate, some claimed that many of the questions were from Democratic supporters just meant to embarrass the Republican candidates. For example, a question over whether or not homosexuals should serve in the U.S. military was asked by retired general and gay activist Keith Kerr, an adviser to Hillary Clinton's campaign. 
The internet has also played a major role in the election, with then-Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul and Democratic candidate Barack Obama being very active on the internet.

Young voters
In 2004, 64% of voters aged 18–29 were registered to vote.  This year 75% of voters in that age group are registered.  This demographic usually favors Democrats.

Fewer Uncommitted
Fewer people were undecided this election than in most previous elections.  As of the beginning of October, 2008 approximately 6-8% of poll respondents were undecided, an amount that continued to decline as the election drew closer.

Election Day
The turnout was about normal, except for higher than usual rates among blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and voters under 30—all Obama groups.  The turnout of evangelicals and whites was similar to 2004. There have been allegations of Democrats driving voters around to different voting stations, and as these are Obama groups, this would strengthen the voter turnout of this demographic.

McCain vs. Obama
McCain had the early edge, wrapping up the Republican nomination before Obama was known to be the choice of the Democrats, but this was one of the few advantages he has had.  Both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama raised far more money than McCain, and the Democratic primary saw a surge of new voters coming out leading to a large increase in the rolls of Democrats.  From the historical position of a generally equal number of Republicans and Democrats, the numbers have now tilted 41% Democrat to only 32% Republican.  From the time that Obama was declared the nominee, opinion polling showed him with a modest advantage over McCain in terms of who the voters would choose to be their next President.
Obama's strategy was to tie McCain to George Bush, a very unpopular President, even though McCain was not a part of the Bush administration and often clashed with Bush during his time as senator.  McCain, for his part, had to walk a fine line with accepting praise from the President to woo conservatives, while at the same time keeping enough distance so as to not alienate moderates.  When possible, McCain went after Obama's lack of foreign policy experience.
The trends heavily favored the Democrats, especially after their major gains in 2006.  Overall, Democrat candidates have a +10% advantage over Republicans in a 'generic' election - the current unpopular President is a Republican, and the economy is treading water.  Also, based on statistical percentages of articles on each candidate, Obama was being focused on by the press far more than McCain.  When McCain chastised Obama for his lack of foreign policy experience and that he hadn't been to Iraq or Afghanistan in years, Obama's campaign set up for him to take a trip to both countries.  While this is expected in politics, the decision of every major network to send a team of reporters to follow him was unprecedented.  Obama spoke to 200,000 people in Berlin in a highly covered speech.  McCain spoke to 50,000 in Buffalo shortly thereafter and barely got a whisper.  Obama's numbers started to rise, but a good deal of the populace was noticing the disparity as 48% of those polled felt the press was trying to help Obama win.
Obama seemed pleased to coast on his advantages, but McCain realized he needed to shake things up.  He scored by pushing offshore drilling for oil during a time when oil prices were climbing almost daily.  Obama rejected the idea, but the poll numbers started to show a greater percentage of Americans warming to the concept[2] and McCain's numbers started to improve.  Obama announced he would accept some measure of offshore drilling, and McCain's momentum was halted and his gains retreated by a couple of points.  McCain started an ad campaign that acknowledged Obama's celebrity status, but asking what it meant.  A few days later at the start of August he called out Obama for 'playing the race card' when Obama made a reference to McCain and Bush trying to scare people because he (Obama) doesn't look like other Presidents on dollar bills.  The Democrats fired back, but quickly let the issue drop when poll numbers showed that most voters did consider Obama's statement to be racist.[3]  The bounce for Obama after the Berlin speech shrank back to pre-trip levels.  While Obama continued to enjoy a slight lead in the polls, McCain continued to keep the race close without either candidate breaking away. 
In mid-August, both candidates came together at the invitation of Pastor Rick Warren where each was asked a series of the same questions dealing both with political and personal views.  While not a debate, it was the first televised forum where both candidates had a chance to express themselves and their positions.  Obama hoped to appeal to Christian conservatives by expressing a religious side while McCain hoped to solidify the conservative base by sharing his own conservative and religious credentials.  The difference in style between the two was evident as Obama spent more time explaining and expounding on his positions while McCain was more straightforward and received more laughs with his candid speaking style.  The polling numbers continued as they had been.
There was a bounce at the start of the Democratic convention, but not what was expected as McCain suddenly drew even in the race.  The friction between Hillary Clinton and Obama as well as the perceived slight of Hillary when Biden was chosen as the Vice Presidential candidate hurt Obama at a time when his approval was expected to climb.  McCain then made a mistake by airing an ad of Hillary Clinton that 'supported' him.  Clinton was set to speak at the convention and it was no secret that there was bad blood between her and Obama and it was widely believed that her support for Obama would be lukewarm at best.  Instead, apparently galvanized by McCain's hubris before her speech, she came out strongly for Obama and rallied those who supported her.  Obama's pre-convention edge returned.  Obama followed it up with a very strong speech the next day in a huge stadium with fireworks and a Greek temple.  Dick Morris, a former Bill Clinton political strategist who gave advice to the Republicans in 2008, felt that Obama had done such a good job reaching out to the groups that he needed that he would pull ahead by double-digits.  In order to suppress the bounce from the convention, McCain announced his Vice Presidential candidate the next day, a woman, Alaskan governor Sarah Palin.  The bounce for Obama was muted at first, but increased in the following days to surpass pre-convention levels, especially as Sarah Palin came under heavy attack in the media.
The edge continued as the Republican convention began.  Losing a day to the hurricane, their shortened convention came out strong as well, emphasizing John McCain as a patriot and a maverick for change who is tested and will do what is right for the country regardless of political affiliation.  It was notable for the secondary role that the sitting President played, talking only briefly and barely being mentioned after that.  The convention tied McCain to Ronald Reagan, a popular Republican President who was able to gain the support of a good number of conservative Democrats, an ability that McCain would badly need to emulate.  While the convention had very high ratings starting with Palin's well received speech, it was unclear what the impact would be in the polls.  Indeed, Obama continued to lead directly afterward, but that soon changed with a turn of about 8 points and a slim lead for McCain.  The Republican convention had actually more than balanced out the powerful Democratic convention.
While Obama had stated that his campaign would avoid negative advertising, as it became clear that the bounce from the convention was continuing to last and he might lose the election, his campaign turned more forcefully to negative advertising.  In ads aired since the Republican convention through mid September, McCain's ads were about Obama 56% of the time, but Obama's ads were about his opponents 77% of the time.[4]  Obama also received a large boost from the press which vigorously attacked McCain, but even more so Palin.  Obama appeared on The O'Reilly Factor and was treated with civility and respect, even if not with agreement.  McCain and his wife appeared on The View and were treated to openly antagonistic attacks.  The constant negative barrage and reporting slowly moved the numbers back to even.
As the negative articles on Palin continued to intensify, some of which just quoted celebrities who had never met her calling her ""whacko"" or a ""hater of women"", her first major interview with Gibson was a turning point.  Gibson asked Palin about the Bush Doctrine, but wouldn't define it for her even as she asked questions for clarifications.  When she then answered with her understanding, Gibson rebuked her by implying that she misunderstood the doctrine.  In truth, since the term is only a press invention, it has taken on different meanings at different times and the definition that Palin gave matched one that Gibson himself had used years earlier.  Nevertheless, it was a moment and was jumped on by the press.  Those who saw the interview voted heavily that they were now less likely to vote for Palin.  The attack on her had muted her effectiveness, even if it was unjustified.
Stemming the tide of the McCain campaign's lead became a strong swing for Obama with a series of events that went to the Democratic nominee's favor.  The polls began to tack to Obama's favor with the collapse of Lehman Brothers and a subsequent 500-point drop in the Dow Jones Index.  Then, President Bush sounded a major alarm on the economy and proposed a huge 700 billion dollar rescue plan for the mortgage industry, which sent shock waves through the American populace and swept them with even more fear on the economic picture.  Bush called both Presidential nominees to meet with him and Congress.  It gave Obama a boost in legitimacy, his previous Achilles' heel.  While he had a weak record in accomplishments and showing leadership, the chance to be propelled to a position of prominence handed it to him on a silver platter.  Moreover, the plan was more problematic among Republicans than it was among Democrats, giving Obama another boost merely by supporting it while putting McCain on more shaky ground.  Both candidates supported it once again blurring McCain's advantage in experience if both men were seen as interchangeable in their reaction.
McCain chose to suspend his campaign until a deal on the rescue package was reached, a mistake.  The Democrats could add pork to the plan and make it even more unpalatable to the Republicans, and they did.  As the first debate loomed and no deal had been reached, McCain was in a quandary.  He chose to attend the debate under the view that the plan was well under way to being passed.  After the debate the plan was actually defeated and wouldn't be adopted, with more changes, until the following week.
McCain's debate with Obama went well and he was viewed as having done better than expected.  Unfortunately for him, Obama was also viewed as doing better than expected and was seen as looking Presidential, further cementing his standing and locking in a lead in the polls that had become rather substantial.  The Vice Presidential debate was the most watched in history and Palin was given high marks for her performance, but unfortunately for the Republican ticket, Biden was also on his game that night and also came across well.  There were no changes in the polling numbers and the number of undecided voters began to quickly dwindle.  The second and third debates caused little change as well.
With Obama spending 110 million dollars on TV advertising in October alone, including 30 minute specials on each of the major networks, McCain was hard pressed to make up the necessary ground to win the election after being outspent by 3 to 1 for TV adds over that time period.  He couldn't count on regular TV to help put in a good word for him either, as late night political jokes are running at a pace of 7 jokes against McCain/Palin for every 1 joke against Obama/Biden and a study of news stories on McCain and Obama since the end of the conventions found that 57% of news stories about McCain were negative while only 29% were for Obama.[5]  A later study by the independent Pew Research Center found that the discrepancy had grown even worse.  McCain had 57% of the articles about him negative while only 14% were positive, while Obama had more positive articles than negative.  The only network to achieve a balance, 40% negative for both, was Fox News.[6]

General Strategy
McCain's team emphasized to convince the electorate of the long-term leadership and experience that John McCain has shown in two decades of government service while emphasizing the relative untested nature of Barack Obama.
Obama's team stressed that Obama is the candidate of fresh ideas while downplaying his relative inexperience compared to the more seasoned McCain.  When possible, McCain is lumped together with George Bush, an unpopular President.

Republican Strategy
With more limited funding than his Democratic rival, McCain had favored open town hall meetings to attract the greatest number of people.  He is focusing his advertising on swing states.  He also asked for open debates with Obama of the Lincoln-Douglas variety where candidates can talk directly to each other, but this was not accepted by the Democratic camp which prefers the current structured format.
McCain will highlight his record of leadership, his service to his country and stress that as President he can be counted on to keep America safe from outside threats.  McCain's strongest supporters are the elderly - the group that most wants stability.
McCain's choice of Sarah Palin as his Vice Presidential nominee was a departure from what was expected and helped to show that he would go down paths that the Republican party had not done in the past.  McCain has touted Palin's record of standing up to the Alaska Republican party when she resigned from an Ethics Commission in protest over a lack of ethics of fellow commissioners, as well as when she ran against, and beat, then-incumbent Governor Frank Murkowski in the Republican primary in 2006.  McCain will continue to tout her as a ""maverick"" to complement his own maverick image that he is trying to emphasize. Last, by choosing a female running mate, McCain hoped to pick up the votes of female voters disaffected with the perceived slight of Hillary Clinton by Obama.  Prior to the start of the Democratic convention, 30% of Hillary's supporters had still not backed Obama and there was a good deal of bad blood between the two.
With the unfolding of the campaign season and watching the Democratic strategy and how it was playing out in the press and polls, the McCain campaign decided not to cede the moniker of change to Obama, but rather to take it upon themselves by emphasizing that McCain has a track record of change - while Obama does not.  The McCain campaign feels it needs to have the voters ask who can be trusted more to get the job done, and if that occurs, then they have the advantage.
With the selection of Palin, and the energy it has brought to the conservative base, McCain has taken to larger rallies, as opposed to town hall meetings and press conferences.  By mid-September, he had gone four weeks without a town hall, and three weeks without a press conference, instead sticking to larger engagements, appearing alongside his vice presidential nominee, with larger crowds than he had experienced earlier in his campaign.

Democratic Strategy
Democrats are confident that the low popularity of President Bush and particularly Operation Iraqi Freedom, which John McCain supports, puts them in a highly favorable position for 2008.  They have been cautious in the Iraq arena realizing that 'The Surge' worked and they were on the wrong end of that issue.  Focus is being put on a timeline for troops coming home, a position that most of the American population favors.
Democrats believe it is their race to lose, but also realize they had a good chance to win the last two Presidential elections and came up short each time.  General wisdom also states that a poor economy favors Obama, so they will emphasize the dire times in this area.  As in past elections, differences between those who have obtained a high income level and those who have not will be emphasized. In fact, the Democratic strategy in many ways mirrors that of their strategy in 1992 when the Democrat-controlled Congress deliberately caused economic disruption, knowing full well that the public would blame sitting president George H.W. Bush, and thereby allowing Bill Clinton to win that year's presidential race.
Favored by the young, Democrats will try hard to encourage and get out the young vote, a task that has proven more difficult than expected in the last two election cycles.  To their advantage, Obama made his vice presidential pick via text message to cell phone numbers registered on the site.  The announcement went to 3 million cell phones, a useful database for ""Get Out The Vote"" (GOTV) efforts, when voters may not be home or reachable on their landline.
As an extension of the DNC's strategy in the 2006 elections, led by Howard Dean, Barack Obama has been working towards a ""50-state strategy.""  The campaign is working to place campaign offices throughout the country with a focus on voter registration.  The increase in the rolls of Democratic voters from the primary battle between Hillary Clinton and Obama played out well for the Democrats and puts pressure on Senator McCain even in typically red states, and more specifically, ""Lean Republican"" states, to use the Cook Political Report's term.  In addition, with a fundraising advantage, Obama is airing ads in those tight states forcing McCain to make decisions about whether to use funds to match ads and campaign efforts in those states or rely on historical results that those states will support him and focus funds in traditional toss-up states instead.

Fundraising
Barack Obama had a significant edge over Hillary Clinton in the fundraising department during their contest for the Democratic nomination, but both actually set records for raising money and both raised far more money than John McCain.  McCain didn't have to spend as much since he locked up the Republican nomination much earlier than Obama locked up the Democratic.  Both Obama and McCain said they would accept government funds—which would also cap how much the candidates could raise on their own—but Obama, who could presumably raise more through his own sources, changed his mind and later declined.  Much of McCain's war chest will come from the Republican Party in general, which has more money to spend than their Democratic counterparts.  McCain's campaign raised $47 million in August, a very sizable figure for him so far and a personal record, but not as strong as Obama's best months. In the same time period, Obama set a record with $66 million. Obama, still having an edge in fundraising that has continued throughout his run for the Presidency, saw $10 million collected the day after Sarah Palin's strongly received convention speech, a new one day record.[7]  The Palin announcement has been good for John McCain's fundraising as well.
Obama set a new record of $150 million raised in September and over $600 million overall.[8]  Obama's camp does not release information on who contributes to the campaign.


Conventions
Democratic National Convention
For a more detailed treatment, see 2008 Democratic National Convention.
The 2008 Democratic National Convention was held in Denver, Colorado, from August 25 to August 27 at Pepsi Center. There, Senator Obama and his running mate were selected to be the party nominee's. Barack Obama will accepted the party's nomination in front of a crowd of more than 75,000 in a free, open event held at INVESCO Field at Mile High, in a platform resemblant to a Greek temple. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is the Permanent Chair of the Convention.
The convention had a rocky start as friction between supporters of Obama and the Clintons was not resolved.  Instead of Obama getting a bump in the polls, his support actually declined.  The Democrats also seemed to be at odds on finding a unifying strategy for how hard to attack John McCain and how to present it.  As Democratic pundit James Carville said in an interview on CNN, ""If this party has a message, it's done a <heck> of a job hiding it tonight, I promise you that.""[9]
A bleak convention was turned around by the Clintons. Infighting between Obama and Hillary continued through the day of her speech, but a comprise was reached, and, beyond expectations, she gave a rousing speech for Obama - possibly as an angry response to McCain's latest ad that showed her 'supporting' him. Bill Clinton the next night also praised Obama, something that he failed to effectively do in 2000 for Al Gore when he centered on his accomplishments and gave little more than lip service to Gore with statements amounting to 'and Al Gore was there too'. The convention, possibly remembering that, gave him the topic he was to speak on instead of choosing his own. Clinton was angered, but it worked. He came through. By the time Obama spoke on the last night, the theme that was missing at first was clear, and Obama mixed a message of attacking McCain with the need for change and even outlining some expensive programs that would appeal to the target populace who has been lukewarm to him. From a political point of view, the convention did what it was supposed to.


Republican National Convention
For a more detailed treatment, see 2008 Republican National Convention.
The 2008 Republican National Convention was held in Saint Paul, Minnesota from September 1 (Labor Day) until September 4. The presumptive nominee was Senator McCain. The location has political significance in that Minnesota will likely be a close state during the general election, as will its neighboring states Wisconsin and Iowa.
The convention schedule had to be altered due to the upcoming landfall of Hurricane Gustav. The first day almost entirely focused on raising money for Hurricane relief.  This led to a shortened three day convention instead of four and there was some shuffling of who was speaking on which day to accommodate the suddenly shortened time span.  In a surprise, George W. Bush was only delivered an eight-minute speech by satellite.  In another surprise Sarah Palin's speech was watched by as many people as saw Obama give his acceptance speech on the closing night of the Democratic convention, as over 40 million people tuned in.[10]  She was considered the highlight of the convention, even surpassing John McCain's speech the next day, and was noted for doing an exceptional job.  Recognizing the strong asset that they have in her, the Republicans made reference to her many times on the last day of the convention.  McCain, not known for being comfortable reading prepared speeches in a convention hall, delivered a solid speech.  While Obama continued to enjoy a lead in the polls, it changed quickly thereafter to a slight McCain-Palin edge.  The Republican convention more than canceled out a very powerful Democratic convention.

Leftist violence
 Poster circulated by community organizers. Other posters depicted rock throwers with the caption, ""Shut Down the RNC!,"" dead elephants, and derogatory and demeaning comments about gay Republicans. [2]
Progressives for Obama shares a huge membership overlap with the Movement for a Democratic Society (MDS), a group of former Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) members and sympathisers. MDS re-founded SDS in 2006 for a new generation of college students and functions as a support group for SDS's 130 college chapters. Independent researcher Trevor Louden refers to MDS as ""the brains behind the SDS brawn.""  The reconstituted SDS was very prominent in the violence at the Republican National Convention at St Paul.[11] The founder of ACORN, Wade Rathke, denouncd[12] an FBI informer who foiled a terrorist plot to kill delegates at the Republican Convention.[13]

Vice Presidential Candidates
Democratic Vice-Presidential Candidate
On August 23, Senator Barack Obama announced, via text message to 3 million cell phone numbers of his supporters, his nomination of Joseph Biden to Vice President.  Biden's selection was considered to be a prudent move by Obama, filling a hole in his own foreign policy experience that McCain could exploit.  With the implosion of John Edwards, Biden was widely expected to be the choice.  In order to help build up suspense, Biden said he was not chosen when he spoke to the press the day before, only to be shown as the Vice Presidential candidate the next day.  A long-term senator and Washington insider with over two decades of service in the Senate, his earlier 1988 plagiarism scandal and frequent gaffes (including one in which he insulted Obama in a racist manner during the 2008 election) were deemed to be less negative than the positive that his strong experience credentials could bring to the race.  

 Joseph Biden




Republican Vice-Presidential Candidate
 thumb
Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska was announced as John McCain's choice early on Friday, August 29, the day after the Democratic convention ended.  A surprise choice not even considered by the press to be on McCain's short list, her selection caught the political world off guard.  It had been expected that Mitt Romney would earn the honor, but McCain had other ideas.  At first denigrated by the people in the Obama campaign, Obama's own statement was one of cautious neutrality to feel out what impact her selection would have on the race.


In an interesting twist, the selection of the Vice Presidential candidates changed the dynamics of the race.  By Obama picking Biden, he helped to fill the hole that McCain had been attacking dealing with a lack of foreign policy experience.  McCain's strongest point, experience, would lose some of its luster.  But the selection of Biden, and the passing over of Hillary Clinton, left another opening.  By aligning himself with someone who has been a Democratic stalwart, Obama's claim to change became less pronounced.  McCain seized upon that to select a Vice President that no one expected, and a woman, and steal some of the Democratic thunder.  Her lack of foreign policy experience would cut into the experience angle that had been in play earlier, but her own maverick streak in becoming governor by ousting another Republican, combined with John McCain's maverick choice in selecting her led to a new emphasis on McCain's own maverick past. Palin arguably had more ""executive"" / managerial experience than either McCain, Biden or, notably, Obama.  Suddenly he saw an opportunity to steal the moniker of change that Obama had been wearing, and he went for it.  Such a change in position occurring from the Vice Presidential selection is rare in Presidential politics.

Debates
Presidential Debates
For a more detailed treatment, see 2008 Presidential Debates.
There have been three presidential debates for the 2008 election season.  The first debate on September 26 discussed ""Foreign Policy & National Security"" and also dealt at length with the economic crisis. The result was a statistical draw where both candidates did better than expected in the eyes of the public.  The longer term impact worked out well for Obama who already had a lead going in, and benefited from solidifying that position.
The second debate on October 7, followed a town hall-style.  The questions came from audience members and the Internet, as chosen by the moderator.  Again the result was a statistical draw as far as who was considered to be the winner.  But with time running out for McCain, he needed something to make the people move his way, and that required a clear breakthrough that never happened
The final debate was held on October 15 concerned ""Domestic and Economic Policy."" Both candidates were again viewed as having done well, which was a tactical defeat for McCain as the poll numbers showed only small changes.

Vice Presidential Debate
There was one vice presidential debate held on October 2.  Palin did much better than expected, but Biden was also in top form.  No clear winner emerged and the poll numbers remained largely unchanged, a strategic win for the Democratic ticket that only had to maintain their lead to win the election.  The number of people who watched the debate was an alltime record for a Vice Presidential debate, and was viewed by more people than any of the three Presidential debates.

Third parties and Independents
As usual there were a number of third party candidates, but none made much of an impact.  Briefly the Libertarian Bob Barr had enough strength to become a spoiler for McCain.  He faded quickly. See United States Presidential Election, 2008 -- Third Party Candidates.

Primaries
For expanded primary information, see United States Presidential Election, 2008 - Primaries
The primary season for both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party officially began on January 3, 2008 with the Iowa Caucuses and ended on June 3, 2008.[14]  The 2008 election cycle saw a major shift in the primary election calendar, frontloading many primaries into early February.[15]
John McCain had to get his footing at first, but was pretty much assured the Republican nomination after Super Tuesday.  Barack Obama had a much tougher road, but rode out a string of victories in February to eventually outlast Clinton and take the nomination.  During that time he had raised more money than any other candidate in history giving him a huge boost, a trend that would continue into the general election.

"""Merriam-Webster""",https://www.conservapedia.com/%22Merriam-Webster%22,"Merriam-Webster is the leading dictionary in America, and the descendant of Noah Webster's dictionaries.
However, it has many errors and biases. Here are a few examples:

The date for eminent domain is incorrect: 1738.[1]  The term dominium eminens was used as early as 1625.[2]
Capital is poorly defined as accumulated goods, or the value of those goods, or net worth.  It is more commonly used to mean liquid assets such as cash, stocks, bonds that can be easily used to acquire goods and services.
Merriam-Webster resists including new conservative terms, such as judicial activism, which dates back to 1947 and has been repeatedly used by the U.S. Supreme Court since 1967, yet is still not included by Merriam-Webster.[3]
It gives the following liberal example of use of the derogatory term ""hell-bent"": ""hell-bent to cut taxes again.""[4]
Merriam-Webster also omitted the term the ""invisible hand"" until the late 1990s, although the term has been in popular use since shortly after its introduction by Adam Smith.  In contrast, new liberal terms are quickly added; for example ""green-collar"" was added in 2009 only three years after it came into common use.
It gives the following liberal example of use of the term ""force-feed"": ""force-feed students with the classics.""[5]
The definition of liberalism as pertaining to politics that is overtly biased towards liberal perceptions of their ""good deeds"" states: "": a political philosophy based on belief in progress, the essential goodness of the human race, and the autonomy of the individual and standing for the protection of political and civil liberties,""[6] actually hijacking conservative values and concealing how liberals demand taxpayer-funded abortion, same-sex marriage, and censorship of classroom prayer.
Merriam-Webster uses a disproportionate number of examples from liberal publications, such as the New York Times, for illustrating how terms are used.
For a criticism of the dictionary treatment of the ""Common Era,"" see CE.
For its 2014 edition, the dictionary included frivolous entires such as ""selfie,"" and ""hashtag,"" which shows a decline in competent literacy in the English language and the influence of the increasingly uneducated, liberal, and vain millennial online culture.

"""Warren Flood""",https://www.conservapedia.com/%22Warren_Flood%22,"Warren Flood was Vice President Joe Biden's information technology (IT) director at the White House.

Guccifer 2.0
On June 15, 2016 the first Guccifer 2.0 document was created by Warren Flood at 13:38 EDT, modified by Феликс Эдмундович (Felix Edmunovich, the Russian patronymic of Felix Edmunovich Dzerzhinsky, founder of the KGB - a blatantly amateurish attempt to create Russian fingerprints) thirty minutes later at 14:08 EDT. A document that Flood authored in 2008, and that was attached to one of John Podesta's emails, was used by Guccifer 2.0 as a template into which he then copied the contents of the Trump Opposition Research, copied from this file: https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/fileid/26562/7365 (which is also attached to this leaked email). It is Flood's document that the ""CONFIDENTIAL"" text in the background derives from.

Guccifer 2.0 is a 2016 Hillary Clinton campaign false flag operation set up to discredit the Seth Rich revelations at Wikileaks.[1][2][3] Adam Carter writes, ""one particular group would have been particularly desperate precisely at that time, for the emergence of a narrative about Russian hackers to discredit proper leaks / justify claims that all leaks are 'probably doctored' and they will have very likely known [Warren] Flood too.That group is the Clinton Campaign.As of June 12th, [2016] they were in a position where Julian Assange had just announced WikiLeaks' upcoming release of Hillary's emails, she was still under FBI investigation, and Trump was attacking Hillary for her use of a private server with his supporters frequently chanting ""lock her up!"" at rallies.The campaign was in a desperate position and really needed something similar to a Russian hacker narrative and one where they would be fortunate to have a seemingly clumsy hacker that leaves lots of 'fingerprints' tainting files and bringing the reputation of leaks into question... Sure enough, 2-3 days later, Guccifer2.0 - the world's weirdest hacker - was spawned and started telling lies in an effort to attribute himself to the malware discoveries, etc.""[4]

''Steele dossier'',https://www.conservapedia.com/%27%27Steele_dossier%27%27," The Obama administration tried to convince the American people through US intelligence agencies and the mainstream media that Vladimir Putin had colluded with the Trump campaign to elect Donald Trump, using the Steele dossier as evidence. The falsified document was bought and paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.Illustration on the Steele Dossier by Alexander Hunter/The Washington Times[1]
The Steele dossier, sometimes referred to as the Clinton-Steele dossier is a discredited political work originally put together as opposition research by the Clinton campaign and Democratic party, which was funneled to the Obama FBI and used to justify illegal surveillance on candidate and President Donald Trump.[2]
On January 10, 2016, ten days before Trump's inauguration, Obama DNI James Clapper leaked the phony Steele dossier to CNN and BuzzFeed who then jointly made it available to the public. The dossier alleges Russian collusion with the Trump campaign. Barack Obama approved declassification and widespread dissemination of the dossier's smears and fake allegations, and violation of the Fourth Amendment rights of American citizens.
The FISA court was not told that the dossier was a Clinton campaign opposition-research project, and that its author, Christopher Steele, had been terminated as an informant for lying to the FBI about his contacts with the media.
The dossier is named after former MI6 officer Christopher Steele, [3] who was paid $168,000 by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats for the smears and used by the Obama Justice Department to perpetrate a fraud upon the FISA court, the media, and American people. While originally using the dossier as ""evidence"" of collusion, Democrats eventually tried to deny or downplay this after it was found to be very unreliable and false.[4]

In the media
FBI Director James Comey illegally kept secret from Congressional oversight the FBI's surveillance of Trump and the Trump organization. However, on September 23, 2016 the first fake news story from the joint Obama FBI/FusionGPS operation appeared in the mainstream media; a story in Yahoo! News by Michael Isikoff about an FBI briefing for Congress with anonymous FBI sources. The briefing material came from Hillary Clinton's  opposition research, written by Christopher Steele.[10] When the Obama DOJ applied for a FISA warrant the following month, they used the Steele dossier as evidence and offered the Yahoo article to corroborate itself.
On October 31, 2016 New York Times published a story with the headline, Investigating Donald Trump, F.B.I. Sees No Clear Link To Russia;[11] The Clinton campaign fell into a tailspin as the FBI reopened the Clinton email investigation over reports classified emails were going on Anthony Weiner's computer. The same day the Times article appeared DNC operative David Corn of Mother Jones magazine reported Steele's fake news allegations under the headline,[12] A Veteran Spy Has Given the FBI Information Alleging a Russian Operation to Cultivate Donald Trump: Has the bureau investigated this material?.
January 10, 2017 Obama and the CIA leaked the phony Steele dossier to CNN & BuzzFeed who jointly made it available to the public. Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, who with the DNC paid for the dossier, secretly met with Simpson.[13] The dossier alleges Russian collusion with the Trump campaign. Steele personally was paid $168,000 to write the phony dossier.
In November 2017 it was reported that Hillary Clinton was again in talks with Christopher Steele to create second dossier of alleged Trump affairs.[14]
By December outrage of the Obama FBI abuses was omnipresent; in seven hours of testimony before House Permanent Select Intelligence Committee (HPSCI) Dep. Dir. Andrew McCabe made statements that contradicted evidence, and was unable to provide any substantive examples of verified allegations in the Steele dossier. When pushed for examples of what was verified in the anti-Trump dossier, McCabe was only able to cite the fact that Trump campaign advisor Carter Page traveled to Moscow — McCabe could not verify anything about the meetings that Page supposedly had. McCabe claimed he could not recall — despite documents with McCabe's own signature on them establishing the fact of his knowledge of the dossier's financing and provenance.[15][16]
FBI Chief Counselor James Baker was fired two hours after McCabe's testimony.[17] Associate Dep. Attn. Gen. Bruce Ohr withheld from his boss, Rod Rosenstein, his secret meetings with Steele and Simpson and the fact his wife Nellie Ohr helped author the phony dossier.[18] Ohr was demoted, and there were calls for McCabe's firing.[19] The House Committees began investigating possible criminal activity among Obama holdovers in DOJ & FBI.[20]

Rep. Jim Jordan said ""We know, for a fact, the Clinton campaign paid Russians to influence the election...Most of Mueller’s team is anti-Trump. We know that. What concerns me is the intent to carry out a plan to disrupt the election. Because as Mr. Strzok said, we can’t afford to leave this in we the people’s hands....I’m convinced now the FBI actively seeking with intent, actively trying to stop Donald Trump from being president of the United States. Everything points to the fact that there was an orchestrated plan to try to prevent Donald Trump from being the next president of the United States.""[21]
Rep. Andy Biggs in USA Today Op-ed called for an end of the Mueller witch-hunt,[22] and Sen. Rand Paul called for an investigation of Obama officials who tried to prevent the election of Donald Trump.[23]

The ""second"" Steele dossier
Sidney Blumenthal is one of Hillary Clinton's closest advisors. It was Blumenthal who spread the smear on Monica Lewinsky that she was stalking President Bill Clinton, a smear dutifully repeated by mainstream media sources.[24] Cody Shearer is a longtime Clinton dirty trickster. It was Shearer who was identified by MSNBC's Chris Matthews as the ""mysterious stranger"" who threatened Kathleen Willey and her children before testifying on behalf of Paula Jones in her sexual harassment suit against Bill Clinton.[25]
Throughout the 2016 presidential election Shearer was tasked by the Clinton machine to dig up dirt on Donald Trump. Shearer authored a report and gave it to Blumenthal, who gave it to State Department official Jonathan Winer,[26] who then gave it to Christopher Steele, who in turn passed it along to the FBI with his dossier.[27] The document is dated October 19, 2016 and was not included in BuzzFeed's January 10, 2017 release of the Steele dossier. The document is said to contain allegations of Trump's personal sexual and financial affairs.
By early 2017 when the Clinton-Steele dossier was exposed as a fraud and no Russian collusion was found, The Guardian reported that the FBI was examining a ""second Steele dossier""[28] - known now as the Shearer dossier. Congressional investigators began looking at how Clinton operatives funneled opposition research to the State Department which made their way into FBI investigative files.[29] At this same time stories about a porn actress who claimed to have had an affair with Trump, was paid off, and like Kathleen Willey, claimed she and her child were threatened by a ""mysterious stranger"" to keep silent appeared in the mainstream media.[30]

Paul Roderick Gregory wrote in Forbes: ""As someone who has worked for more than a decade with the microfilm collection of Soviet documents in the Hoover Institution Archives, I can say that the dossier itself was compiled by a Russian, whose command of English is far from perfect and who follows the KGB (now FSB) practice of writing intelligence reports, in particular the practice of capitalizing all names for easy reference"".[31]
Russian Sergei Skripal, who survived an assassination attempt in Salisbury, England in March 2018, ""almost certainly has links to Christopher Steele"", according to Business Insider.[32]  Writer Rob Slane has stated: ""Now, we know that there is a link between the apparent author of the Trump Dossier, Christopher Steele and Mr Skripal's MI6 recruiter and handler, Pablo Miller. And we know that Miller and Skripal met regularly. Not only this, but we also know that there is a direct link between Steele and Skripal dating back to the late 1990s, early 2000s.[33]
Although the Steele dossier is discredited in the United States, some newspapers in the United Kingdom still appear to believe that it is genuine and that the evidence against it is Russian disinformation.[34]

1 Peter,https://www.conservapedia.com/1_Peter,"I Peter is a book in the New Testament.
This epistle is addressed by Saint Peter to Christian communities of dispersed believers (see Acts 11:19) located in five provinces of Asia Minor, including areas evangelized by Paul (Acts 16:6-7; 18:23). He encourages Christians there to remain faithful to their standards of belief and conduct in spite of threats of persecution. Numerous statements in the letter suggest that the communities addressed were largely Gentile in membership (1 Peter 1:14, 18; 2:9-10; 4:3-4) even though abundant use is made of the Old Testament (1 Peter 1:24; 2:6-7, 9-10, 22; 3:10-12), which suggests also that they had become acquainted with the scriptures in their catechetical instructions before becoming committed Christians.
After the opening address the contents are intended to both inspire and admonish these ""chosen sojourners"" (1 Peter 1:1), who feel an alienation from their previous religious roots and the society around them even while seeking to live as God's people. Peter appeals to Christ's resurrection, and the confident expectation of future hope it provides (1 Peter 1:3-5), and to the experience of the new birth of baptism (1:3, 23-25; 3:21). The suffering and death of Christ can serve simultaneously as both source of salvation and example (1:19; 2:21-25). As a people who have received mercy and have a sacred duty to proclaim and live according to God's call (2:9-10), Christians are in Christ, and Peter repeatedly spells out for them what they are to be in him in all kinds of situations, in society (2:11-17), in work (even as slaves, 2:18-20), in the home (3:1-7), and in their general conduct (3:8-12; 4:1-11). But there remains the overall possibility of suffering as a Christian (3:13-17). In 1 Peter 4:12-19 he describes persecution as already occurring, so that some readers and exegetes have supposed that the letter was addressed both to places where such a ""trial by fire"" was already a reality and to places where such a trial might break out.
Peter's letter constantly mingles moral exhortation (Greek parakēsis) with its catechetical summaries of mercies in Christ. Encouragement to maintain firm fidelity in spite of suffering is based on a clear grasp of the meaning of Christian existence. His emphasis on baptism and his clearly evident allusions to various features of the baptismal liturgy suggest that he has incorporated into his exposition numerous homiletic, credal, hymnic, and sacramental elements of the baptismal rite that at an early date had already become traditional.
Christian tradition, from Irenaeus in the late second century until modern times, regarded Peter the Apostle as author of this document. Since according to tradition he was martyred at Rome during the persecution of Nero between A.D. 64 and 67, almost universally it was supposed that the letter was written from Rome shortly before his death. This is supposed by its reference to ""the chosen one at Babylon"" (1 Peter 5:13), commonly regarded as a code name for the corrupt harlot city of pagan Rome with its idols, temples and emperors declaring themselves to be God[1]. The King James Bible does not offer a note at the end of the letter regarding where it was written. 
Some liberal scholars, on the basis of a number of features they consider in their opinion to be incompatible with Petrine authenticity, regard 1 Peter as the work of a later Christian writer. Such features include the cultivated Greek in which it is written, a style difficult to ascribe to an uncultured Galilean fisherman, on the a priori assumption that he could never change and grow in understanding and be able, even with the grace of God, to improve in any way at all in his communication skills; also the letter's use of the Greek Septuagint translation in citing the Old Testment; the letter's similarity in thought and expression to the Pauline literature; and allusions to ""widespread"" persecution of Christians which they assert did not occur until at least the reign of Domitian (A.D. 81-96). According to this view the letter would date from the end of the first century or even the beginning of the second, when there is evidence for persecution of Christians in Asia Minor, for example, in the letter of Pliny the Younger to Trajan, A.D. 111-112.
Against this, other scholars assert that these objections can be met by appealing to the use of an amanuensis, a secretary, Silvanus, mentioned in 1 Peter 5:12. Such secretaries often as a matter of course, and as expected, gave literary expression to the author's thoughts in their own style and language. God as author, the Holy Spirit, moved both men to express what He wanted said. Also, the persecutions can refer to local areas and regions of harassment rather than to systematic repression by the state. With these wholly realistic considerations in view, there is nothing in the document incompatible in any way with Petrine authorship in the A.D. 60's.
It has been suggested that it is unlikely that Peter addressed a letter to the Gentile churches of Asia Minor while Paul was still alive, which proposes a period after the death of the two apostles, perhaps A.D. 70-90. The author would then be a disciple of Peter in Rome, representing a Petrine group that served as a bridge between the Palestinian origins of Christianity and its flowering in the Gentile world. The problem addressed would not be official persecution but the difficulty of living the Christian life in a hostile, secular environment that espoused different values and subjected the Christian minority to ridicule and oppression.
In answer it may be said that Peter, as an involved and concerned general leading pastor of the scattered Christians in Paul's area of ministry (see Acts 9:32; 15:6-11), during Paul's imprisonment in Caesarea and in Rome (Acts 22–24), when Paul was not able to minister to them, would have written to them and to their own local pastors (5:1-5) this letter of encouragement and admonition in language they would have come to expect from Paul as pastor and shepherd, assisted by Silvanus, whom Peter mentions (1 Peter 5:12), one of those who had traveled and ministered with Paul, and a man who knew him intimately.
The letter can be divided into five sections:

Address (1:1-2)
The Gift and Call of God in Baptism (1:3–2:10)
The Christian in a Hostile World (2:11–4:11)
Advice to the Persecuted (4:12–5:11)
Conclusion (5:12-14)
Chapter 1 He gives thanks to God for the benefit of our being called to the true faith, and to eternal life; into which we are to enter by many tribulations. He exhorts to holiness of life; considering the holiness of God and our redemption by the blood of Christ.Chapter 2 We are to lay aside all guile, and go to Christ the living stone; and as being now hos people, walk worthy of him, with submission to supervisors, and patience under sufferings.Chapter 3 How wives are to behave to their husbands; what ornaments they are to seek. Exhortations to diverse virtues.Chapter 4 Exhortations to cease from sin: to mutual charity: to do all for the glory of God: to be willing to suffer for Christ.Chapter 5 He exhorts both presbyters and laity, to their respective duties, and recommends to all humility and watchfulness.

15th Amendment,https://www.conservapedia.com/15th_Amendment,"To former abolitionists and to the Radical Republicans in Congress who fashioned Reconstruction after the Civil War, the Fifteenth Amendment, enacted in 1870, appeared to signify the fulfillment of all promises to African Americans. Set free by the Thirteenth Amendment, with citizenship guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, black males were given the vote by the Fifteenth Amendment. From that point on, the freedmen were generally expected to fend for themselves. In retrospect, it can be seen that the Fifteenth Amendment was in reality only the beginning of a struggle for equality that would continue for more than a century before African Americans could begin to participate fully in American public and civic life.
African Americans exercised the franchise and held office in many Southern states through the 1880s, but in the early 1890s, steps were taken to ensure subsequent “white supremacy.” Literacy tests for the vote, “grandfather clauses” excluding from the franchise all whose ancestors had not voted in the 1860s, and other devices to disenfranchise African Americans were written into the constitutions of former Confederate states. Social and economic segregation were added to black America’s loss of political power. In 1896 the Supreme Court decision Plessy v. Ferguson legalized “separate but equal” facilities for the races. For more than 50 years, the overwhelming majority of African American citizens were reduced to second-class citizenship under the “Jim Crow” segregation system. During that time, African Americans sought to secure their rights and improve their position through organizations such as National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the National Urban League and through the individual efforts of reformers like Booker T. Washington, W.E.B. DuBois, and A. Philip Randolph. 
The most direct attack on the problem of African American disfranchisement came in 1965. Prompted by reports of continuing discriminatory voting practices in many Southern states, President Lyndon B. Johnson, himself a southerner, urged Congress on March 15, 1965, to pass legislation “which will make it impossible to thwart the Fifteenth Amendment.” He reminded Congress that “we cannot have government for all the people until we first make certain it is government of and by all the people.” The Voting Rights Act of 1965, extended in 1970, 1975, 1982, and 2006, abolished all remaining deterrents to exercising the franchise and authorized Federal supervision of voter registration where necessary.
The Fifteenth Amendment was the last of the Reconstruction amendments after the Civil War.  There would not be any new amendments until the 20th century.

Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors.






2

Therefore David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.






3

And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more than if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?






4

Then David inquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand.






5

So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.






6

And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.






7

And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.






8

And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.






9

And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.






10

Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.






11

Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.






12

Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver thee up.






13

Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth.






14

And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.






15

And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.






16

And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.






17

And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.






18

And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.






19

Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?






20

Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hand.






21

And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion on me.






22

Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told me that he dealeth very subtilly.






23

See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.






24

And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.






25

Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David: wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.






26

And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.






27

But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.






28

Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela-hammahlekoth.






29

And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at En-gedi.

And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.






2

Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.






3

And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave.






4

And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the LORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily.






5

And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.






6

And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the LORD's anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.






7

So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.






8

David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.






9

And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?






10

Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee: but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the LORD's anointed.






11

Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.






12

The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.






13

As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.






14

After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.






15

The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.






16

And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.






17

And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.






18

And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand, thou killedst me not.






19

For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day.






20

And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.






21

Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house.






22

And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the hold.

Analysis


1

And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.






2

And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.






3

Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.






4

And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.






5

And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:






6

And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be both to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto all that thou hast.






7

And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.






8

Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son David.






9

And when David's young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.






10

And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants nowadays that break away every man from his master.






11

Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be?






12

So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings.






13

And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff.






14

But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them.






15

But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields:






16

They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.






17

Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.






18

Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.






19

And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.






20

And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert of the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them.






21

Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good.






22

So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.






23

And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,






24

And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.






25

Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.






26

Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.






27

And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord.






28

I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days.






29

Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.






30

And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;






31

That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid.






32

And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me:






33

And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.






34

For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.






35

So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.






36

And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.






37

But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.






38

And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote Nabal, that he died.






39

And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head, And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.






40

And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee to take thee to him to wife.






41

And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.






42

And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.






43

David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives.






44

But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.

1

And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?






2

Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.






3

And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.






4

David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed.






5

And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him.






6

Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.






7

So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.






8

Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time.






9

And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD's anointed, and be guiltless?






10

David said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish.






11

The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.






12

So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them.






13

Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space being between them:






14

And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king?






15

And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.






16

This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster.






17

And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.






18

And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?






19

Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.






20

Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.






21

Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.






22

And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it.






23

The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness: for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's anointed.






24

And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.






25

Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.

And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.






2

And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.






3

And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.






4

And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.






5

And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?






6

Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.






7

And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.






8

And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt.






9

And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.






10

And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.






11

And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David, and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the Philistines.






12

And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever.

3

Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.






4

And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa.






5

And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled.






6

And when Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams nor by Urim, nor by prophets.






7

Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor.






8

And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee.






9

And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?






10

And Saul sware to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.






11

Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.






12

And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.






13

And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.






14

And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.






15

And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.






16

Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?






17

And the LORD hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the LORD hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even to David:






18

Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee this day.






19

Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.






20

Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.






21

And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.






22

Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.






23

But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.






24

And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof:






25

And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.

And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward with Achish.






3

Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews here? And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto this day?






4

And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? should it not be with the heads of these men?






5

Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?






6

Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, as the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour thee not.






7

Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.






8

And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?






9

And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.

Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master's servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the morning, and have light, depart.

And had taken the women captives, that were therein: they slew not any, either great or small, but carried them away, and went on their way.






3

So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives.






4

Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.






5

And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.

And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God.

And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.

9

So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.






10

But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.

And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water;

And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.






13

And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days agone I fell sick.






14

We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon the coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.

And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this company.






16

And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.






17

And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.






18

And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives.






19

And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had taken to them: David recovered all.






20

And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave before those other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil.

And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.






22

Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and depart.






23

Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand.






24

For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike.






25

And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.

And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.






4

Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.






5

And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him.






6

So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together.






7

And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.






8

And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.






9

And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the house of their idols, and among the people.






10

And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.






11

And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul;






12

All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.






13

And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.

''Ms. Pac-Man'',https://www.conservapedia.com/%27%27Ms._Pac-Man%27%27,"Ms. Pac-Man is a video arcade game produced by Midway as an unauthorized sequel to Pac-Man. It was released in 1981 in North America. Becoming enormously popular, Namco (the producers of Pac-Man) adopted it as an official title. The game features a female protagonist, several differently designed mazes, mobile fruits, and several other minor gameplay differences. 
The gameplay is largely identical to that of Pac-Man, where the protagonist eats pellets and avoids four ghosts. In order to complete the maze, all pellets must be eaten. If the player consumes a ""power pellet"", they can eat the ghosts for a limited time for points. Fruits can be eaten for bonus points. The player has three lives and loses one every time they are touched by a ghost. As the player progresses through the mazes, the difficulty and speed increases.

2012 Presidential election,https://www.conservapedia.com/2012_Presidential_election,"The Presidential Election 2012 was held on Tuesday, November 6, 2012.  By relying on extensive early voting driven by the Democrat political machine—which totaled more than 40% of the vote -- Barack Obama defeated Mitt Romney despite losing nearly 10 million votes from 2008, carrying fewer states and a smaller proportion of both the electoral vote and the popular vote than he had before.  Thus, Obama's ""victory"" was smaller in magnitude by four different measures than in 2008.
Obama was leading in the polls by a substantial margin until the first presidential debate, which Romney won by the widest margin ever recorded by Gallup polling.  Afterward Romney surpassed Obama and was leading by 49-48% in both the Rasmussen and Gallup polls on Election Day.
As Conservapedia anticipated, this election was similar to the election of 1948, when the RINO Thomas Dewey was unable to attract grassroots voters despite the unpopularity of Harry Truman and the deteriorating economy.  A handful of swing states selected the winner in both instances.



Issue or Factor

Mitt Romney

Barack Obama

Comment


Social issues

Romney has downplayed social issues, but supports defunding Planned Parenthood and would likely nominate more conservative judges.

Obama is vocally pro-abortion, pro-same-sex marriage, and pro-homosexual agenda.

As with Tom Dewey's loss in 1948, Romney's running away from social issues could cost him the election.


Economic issues

Romney favors free enterprise, low taxes, and personal responsibility.

Obama says he inherited the crisis from Republicans.

The advantage here is Romney's.


Leadership

Romney was head of Bain Capital, was Governor of Massachusetts and led the 2002 Olympics.

Obama took advantage of  Hurricane Sandy to create an impression that he was a competent leader, but, a week after the storm, its effects are still being felt.

Both candidates have proven leadership skills, but Obama's response to Hurricane Sandy is being celebrated by the liberal press.


Likability

Romney's likability rating stands at only 31%, and has been lower.

Obama's likability rating is at 48%.

Advantage to Obama.


Debates

Romney is a good debater.

Obama struggles without a teleprompter, but will benefit from liberal moderators.

Advantage to Romney.


VPs

Paul Ryan has youth, energy, and likability, but is part of the Big Government Republican leadership in Congress, which has an ultra-low approval rating; Romney has been criticized for not using Ryan more effectively in the campaign.[1]

Joe Biden is a gaffe-prone goofball, but is protected by the liberal media.

Toss-up here, or maybe a slight edge to Ryan.


Fundraising

Mitt did not turn out to be as strong a fundraiser as expected, nor were the Super PACs effective on his side; some of their comments to the press, like Karl Rove criticizing Todd Akin, were actually hurtful.

Limousine liberals have donated millions to Obama's reelection, and once again the Dems outspend the Republicans.

Advantage to Obama.


Gaffes/staying on message

47% of American don't pay income tax and won't vote for me[2][3]/London Olympics not ready comment[4]

""You didn't build that""

Obama has a media covering up his gaffes any way they can, but Romney has better control of his message. Advantage to Romney.

Following the 2012 Republican Primaries the Republican National Convention nominated the RINO Mitt Romney for president and Paul Ryan for vice president, and their strategy appears to be to duck and avoid social issues as much as possible.  The selection and Paul Ryan as VP and polling during the first half of the convention showed only a slight bounce in voter support for Romney.

History
No incumbent has won reelection in the past 70 years with unemployment above 7.2%; reported unemployment is at 7.9% (and real unemployment much higher).[5]

Campaign strategy
Both campaigns have focused on key battleground states: Florida, Ohio, Virginia.[6] A CNN summary of poll of likely voters taken just before the first debate had Obama leading Romney in Florida, 47% to 46%, in Virginia 48% to 46% and in Ohio 52% to 43%.[6]
Romney made a last-minute effort in Pennsylvania, including both ads and personal appearances, but Obama ultimately won Pennsylvania's electoral votes.  The October 25 Rasmussen poll in Pennsylania had the state 51% for Obama and 46% for Romney, but the last minute effort did not move enough voters to change the outcome.[7]

Fundraising
The Associated Press reports that the following people are the top donors to Mitt Romney's campaign and his ""Restore Our Future"" SuperPAC:[8]



Donor
Amount


Sheldon Adelson, 79, owner of the Las Vegas Sands casino empire.

$34.2 million


 Harold Simmons, 81, owner of Contran Corp.

$16 million


 Bob J. Perry, 80, a Houston real estate investor

 $15.3 million


 Robert Rowling, 58, head of Dallas-based TRT Holdings

 $4.1 million


William Koch, 72, an industrialist whose family owns an energy and mining conglomerate

$3 million

Debates
The Commission on Presidential Debates is sponsoring four debates.[9] Although many candidates will appear on the ballot in some states, the Commission is limiting participation in the debates to just candidates that appear on enough states to be mathematically eligible to win the presidency. Candidates also must gain at least 15% support in five national polls as of the date of determination, to be some time after Labor Day 2012.[10] The debates are:

Wednesday October 3: The first presidential debate took place at the University of Denver in Denver, Colorado,[11] moderated by Jim Lehrer[12]
Thursday October 11: The vice-presidential debate took place at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky,[11] moderated by Martha Raddatz of ABC News[12]
Tuesday October 16: The second presidential debate (with a town-hall meeting format) took place at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York.[11] moderated by Candy Crowley of CNN.[12][13]
Monday October 22: The third and final presidential debate on foreign policy took place at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Florida,[11] moderated by Bob Schieffer of CBS News.[12]
An independent presidential debate, sponsored by the Free and Equal Elections Foundation and moderated by former CNN host Larry King, took place on October 23, 2012, at the Hilton Hotel in Chicago, Illinois. President Obama and Governor Romney declined invitations, while Johnson, Goode, Stein and Anderson participated.[14] A second independent debate took place on October 30 in Washington, D.C.[15]

Minor parties
With record-low support for either major party candidate, this could be a year when minor parties do unusually well.



Party

Candidate

Comments


Constitution Party[16]

Virgil Goode[17]

Popular ex-Congressman from Virginia who had previously won election as a Democrat, Independent, and Republican. Joined the Constitution Party in 2010. Opposes illegal immigration and calls for a reduction in legal immigration as well. Won the Constitution Party nomination for president in April on the first ballot.


Green Party[18]

Jill Stein[19]

Defeated Roseanne Barr for the Green Party nomination. Criticizes Obama for allegedly perpetuating the policies of the Bush administration. Supports the Occupy Wall Street protests. Was previously the Green Party candidate in a series of elections in Massachusetts including a Gubernatorial Election against Mitt Romney (among others).


Justice Party[20]

Rocky Anderson[21]

Libertarian Party[22]

Gary Johnson[23]

The former Republican two-term governor of New Mexico, Johnson favors the fair tax, ending American military actions overseas, legalizing marijuana, expanding legal immigration and allowing same-sex marriage.  Given Ron Paul's libertarian campaign for the Republican nomination and the exclusion of Johnson from most of the debates, there was little room for Johnson as a Republican this election cycle. He won the Libertarian Party nomination on May 5, 2012.

Democratic National Convention
Summary
The 2008 Democratic National Convention was held in Denver, Colorado, from August 25 to August 27 at Pepsi Center. There, Senator Obama and his running mate were selected to be the party nominee's. Barack Obama will accepted the party's nomination in front of a crowd of more than 75,000 in a free, open event held at INVESCO Field at Mile High, in a platform resemblant to a Greek temple. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is the Permanent Chair of the Convention.
The convention had a rocky start as friction between supporters of Obama and the Clintons was not resolved.  Instead of Obama getting a bump in the polls, his support actually declined.  The Democrats also seemed to be at odds on finding a unifying strategy for how hard to attack John McCain and how to present it.  As Democratic pundit James Carville said in an interview on CNN, ""If this party has a message, it's done a <heck> of a job hiding it tonight, I promise you that.""[1]
A bleak convention was turned around by the Clintons. Infighting between Obama and Hillary continued through the day of her speech, but a comprise was reached, and, beyond expectations, she gave a rousing speech for Obama - possibly as an angry response to McCain's latest ad that showed her 'supporting' him. Bill Clinton the next night also praised Obama, something that he failed to effectively do in 2000 for Al Gore when he centered on his accomplishments and gave little more than lip service to Gore with statements amounting to 'and Al Gore was there too'. The convention, possibly remembering that, gave him the topic he was to speak on instead of choosing his own. Clinton was angered, but it worked. He came through. By the time Obama spoke on the last night, the theme that was missing at first was clear, and Obama mixed a message of attacking McCain with the need for change and even outlining some expensive programs that would appeal to the target populace who has been lukewarm to him. From a political point of view, the convention did what it was supposed to.

Scandal
Denver officials had constructed a secret jail to house those that would misbehave in the Mile High City when the Democrats attend their convention. The makeshift holding center, dubbed ""Gitmo on the Platte"" by activists, contained barbed wire fencing and signs warning of stun gun use. The Steele Street warehouse was designed to process 60 arrestees per hour.[2]
Ingrid Mattson, president of the Islamic Society of North America, spoke at a prayer service at the convention. Hidden from the public because nobody debated it at the time, the group has ties to funding Hamas terrorists and the facts were well known July 2008. Mattson's group says it does not condone terrorism.  The Holy Land Foundation and five of its former leaders were convicted of funneling millions of dollars to Hamas for which the ISNA funded and supported.[3]
Cnet reported that in the week of the convention, an unusual phenomenon occurred on Craigslist's Denver Web site. Ads soliciting casual sex spiked 80% that week, as tens of thousands of people had arrived for the Democratic convention. Those convention days showed the week-over-week jump in sex ads. Monday increased 77 percent over the average of earlier in the month; Tuesday increased 69 percent; Wednesday's increase was 74 percent. The online solicitations featured such lurid titles as ""Does the DNC make you hot?"" and content far worse than that.[4] No analogous phenomenon was reported during the Republican convention.

Protest

American Right to Life Action, an anti-abortion group, claims to have displayed the largest ever protest sign in history, 530 feet tall and 666 feet wide. The sign says ""Destroys uNborn Children"" [sic], with the words appearing one atop each other to also form the acronym ""DNC."" [5] According to a release from the group, ""thousands of DNC delegates and journalists can look out their hotel windows to the west to see the sign."" ""The tiniest boys and girls should be loved and protected, but as nominating Barack Obama emphasizes, the DNC even supports killing kids in the womb old enough to know their mother's voice, sleep and dream, suck their thumbs, and play with their toes."" The Guinness Book of World Records assigned American Right To Life an official world record attempt number: 228132.

Republican National Convention
Summary
The 2008 Republican National Convention was held in Saint Paul, Minnesota from September 1 (Labor Day) until September 4. The presumptive nominee was Senator McCain. The location has political significance in that Minnesota will likely be a close state during the general election, as will it's neighboring states Wisconsin and Iowa.
The convention schedule had to be altered due to the upcoming landfall of Hurricane Gustav. The first day almost entirely focused on raising money for Hurricane relief.  This led to a shortened three day convention instead of four and there was some shuffling of who was speaking on which day to accommodate the suddenly shortened time span.  In a surprise, George W. Bush was only delivered an eight minute speech by satellite.  In another surprise Sarah Palin's speech was watched by as many people as saw Obama give his acceptance speech on the closing night of the Democratic convention, as over 40 million people tuned in.[6]  She was considered the highlight of the convention, even surpassing John McCain's speech the next day, and was noted for doing an exceptional job.  Recognizing the strong asset that they have in her, the Republicans made reference to her many times on the last day of the convention.  McCain, not known for being comfortable reading prepared speeches in a convention hall, delivered a solid speech.  While Obama continued to enjoy a lead in the polls, it changed quickly thereafter to a slight McCain-Palin edge.  The Republican convention more than canceled out a very powerful Democratic convention.

Convention Schedule
Note:  Due to the hurricane and the effort to use their public forum to raise funds for it, the first night of the Republican convention was not shown.  Adjustments were made throughout to accommodate that loss.

12 Disciples,https://www.conservapedia.com/12_Disciples,"The Twelve Apostles or The Twelve Disciples were the twelve followers of Jesus while He walked the earth.  Jesus called each of them to Him at the start of His earthly ministry and they followed Him during the three years of his teaching.  While making many gaffes and having difficulty understanding all that Jesus was, after His crucifixion and Resurrection and the imparting of the Holy Spirit, they became men of great valor and the forefathers of Christianity. 
They are Saints in the Catholic and Orthodox traditions except for Judas Iscariot, the traitor of Jesus.[1]

2010 FIFA,https://www.conservapedia.com/2010_FIFA,"The 2010 FIFA World Cup was an international Soccer tournament held in South Africa and won by Spain.[1]
Bidding contests for FIFA World Cups are extremely competitive.  After Germany was awarded the 2006 tournament, Sepp Blatter, president of FIFA made a personal pledge to ensure that the following tournament would be held in Africa, a continent which had never previously hosted the World Cup but which was central to FIFA's aim of growing the sport globally.
Four bids were submitted, by Egypt, Libya & Tunisia, Morocco and South Africa.  Libya and Tunisia withdrew their bid, and in 2004 South Africa beat Morocco and Egypt to be declared the 2010 host.
In order to host the tournament, South Africa has built five new stadiums, and upgraded four others.

Competing Nations
32 national teams competed in the 2010 World Cup.  South Africa, as hosts, were guaranteed a spot.  Each regional confederation ran a qualifying tournament to determine which of its member nations would attend the finals in South Africa, with the qualifiers being:
Africa: Algeria, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa (hosts)
Asia: Australia, Japan, North Korea, South Korea
Europe: Denmark, England, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland
North America: Honduras, Mexico, United States
South America: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay
Oceania: New Zealand

Outcome
The 2010 World Cup saw three European teams in the first three places: it was won by Spain, with the Netherlands as runner-ups and Germany in the third place. Uruguay was the South American team which had the best result, ending up in the fourth place.
Diego Forlán was proclaimed the best player of the competition; Thomas Müller, David Villa, Wesley Sneijder and Diego Forlan were tied as top-scorers, with 5 goals each. Müller was awarded the Golden Boot because of his three assists.

Although touted as secure, read-only files, they can be edited with a little effort using special software.[3][4] Theses changes are often but not always placed on another virtual layer of the file.
PDF files are only supported by Windows and Macintosh operating systems.  These are useless to users of GNU/Linux and UNIX systems.[2]
PDF files are created with a set (A4 or A3) size, which cannot be changed.  This size is perfect for printing on 8.5 by 11 inch paper, but does not fit most modern computer monitors very well.[5]

.40 Smith and Wesson cartridge,https://www.conservapedia.com/.40_Smith_and_Wesson_cartridge,"The .40 S&W or .40 Smith & Wesson cartridge is a popular and relatively new round designed primarily as a more effective replacement for the 9mm round, which has been shown to lack sufficient stopping power according to some studies and real world events including FBI related shootings.

Appeal for Home Security
The .40 S&W is popular for home security for several reasons. The first is that it offers greater stopping power than the 9mm, while maintaining more manageable recoil and a lower price per round than the .45 ACP. The second is that it is the standard issue round for many law enforcement agencies in the United States.

"""Christmas tree"" bill",https://www.conservapedia.com/%22Christmas_tree%22_bill,"A ""Christmas tree bill"" is informal nomenclature for a bill on the Senate floor that attracts many, often unrelated, floor amendments, or riders. The amendments which adorn the bill may provide special benefits to various groups or interests.[1]
An example is the National Defense Authorization Act; since the bill is a must-pass issue, as it provides for funding for Operation Iraqi Freedom, members of the Democratic party have tried to tag the bill with various other amendments supporting the homosexual agenda. Bills that would be politically dangerous for members of Congress to be on record as voting against are thus especially likely to become ""Christmas tree"" bills.

1980 Presidential Election,https://www.conservapedia.com/1980_Presidential_Election," President Carter with Governor Reagan
President Jimmy Carter had lost the confidence of America due to economic problems and the hostages in Iran. Although incumbent Presidents usually win renomination easily, Carter had to fight a tough, long primary battle against Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy. At the time, several candidates fervently sought the Republican nomination for the Presidency. Former CIA director George H. W. Bush was a leading candidate and led for a time. Former Hollywood actor and conservative two term governor of California, Ronald Reagan, however, badly wanted the nomination and made many more speaking engagements. Reagan was then able to sweep the primaries and win the nomination. One of the other Republican candidates was liberal Illinois Representative John Anderson. Reagan considered having former President Gerald Ford as his running-mate, referred to as the ""dream ticket,"" but Ford wanted more presidential power than Reagan was willing to give him.  Reagan instead chose his lead rival, George H. W. Bush, as his running-mate, but ran the risk of giving ammunition to his enemies since during the primary race Bush had referred to Reagan's economic policies as ""voodoo economics."" 
Anderson, not satisfied to accept his defeat, ran as a third-party candidate and gained traction because of his moderate views.  Although it is hard to imagine today, at that time the options of Reagan and Carter were considered weak, with many people dissatisfied with the choices.
Reagan was able to do better than Carter in their speaking appearances, which culminated in a live Presidential Debate between the two candidates shortly before the election. Reagan used Carter's own words against him when he brought up Carter's use of the term 'the misery index' to describe the suffering of the American people when he was running for President against Ford in 1976.  Carter defined it as the sum of the unemployment rate and inflation rate.  Unfortunately for Carter, the value of the misery index, which he had charged in 1976 was too high, was much higher in 1980 as Reagan pointed out.  Reagan then boldly asked his audience at the end of his debate with Carter, ""Next Tuesday all of you will go to the polls; you'll stand there and make a decision, it might be well if you would ask yourself: Are you better off than you were four years ago?""
President Carter faced a difficult reelection. Iranian Islamists were holding 53 members of the American embassy staff hostage and the rescue attempt had failed miserably, Castro flooded Florida with Cuban refugees, there was a national oil shortage resulting in increased gasoline prices, high unemployment, and 18 percent inflation. Reagan ran as a Washington outsider as the Republican nominee. The centerpiece of the Reagan campaign was his record as an effective Governor, where he is credited for reducing California’s deficit while lowering taxes, and pointing out the  failures of the Carter administration. Reagan's campaign gained strong financing support from political action committees (PAC), receiving $12 million from PAC's, compared to $50,000 on Carter’s behalf. Carter tried to cast his presidency in the best possible light, stressing the 1978 Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt. He portrayed himself as a peacemaker and Reagan as a warmonger. Although because of Reagan's cool and confident manner, this proved to be ineffective.

Result
While the polls had been showing a close race up until a week before the election, when the election finally came up, Reagan held a surprisingly strong victory.  Carter capitulated while voting was still going on in the west, which angered his party as many Democratic Congressmen lost their elections after that and blamed Carter for his premature announcement that caused a number of Democratic voters not to go to the polls.[1]

1964 presidential election,https://www.conservapedia.com/1964_presidential_election,"President Lyndon B. Johnson was still popular, despite the fact that America was increasingly involved in the Vietnam War.  Johnnson's popularity ensured his nomination as the Democratic presidential candidate, while the Republicans chose conservative senator Barry Goldwater as their candidate.  Goldwater wanted to change the strategy for the war in Vietnam (once saying he would use an atomic bomb to stop Chinese supply lines.)  Johnson countered that he would not escalate the war in Vietnam.  Johnson won a landslide victory in the election.[1]
This would be the last time the Republican Party campaigned solely towards its right-wing base supporters. Goldwater subsequently realised that relying on the Republican base alone would not be enough to win an election, and took steps to ensure that from 1968 onwards the Republicans would campaign across a broader political spectrum while still holding true to Conservative values.

Democratic convention
Johnson orders illegal FBI spying
Johnson ordered illegal FBI wiretaps on enemies and allies alike. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Attorney General Robert Kennedy, whose Department included the FBI, both were  wiretapped during the convention without their knowledge. Johnson received nearly hourly reports on their private conversations and activities at Oval Office where he orchestrated convention events.
During the controversy over seating the all-white Mississippi delegation a protest demonstration was occurring outside. Johnson phoned the head of a television broadcast network and instructed him, 

Get your G****m cameras off the n*****s out front and back on the speaker's stand inside, G****m it![2]
In 1975 the New York Times noted,

the 1964 incident is an even graver offense than the original Watergate break-in, for it represented the turning of a police instrument of Government [FBI] to illegal activities for political purposes.[3]
Campaign
Johnson's misuse of CIA
In 1964 E. Howard Hunt, Jr. was serving as chief of covert action for the CIA's Domestic Operations Division. He was order to spy on Goldwater's campaign headquarters. He set up a special unit and arranged daily pick-up of ""any and all information"" about Goldwater and his plans. These included advance copies of the candidate's speeches, texts which often had not yet been made available to the press. The consequence of this was that before Goldwater had even opened his mouth, Democrats had five speakers primed to reply. Hunt was ordered to spy on Goldwater directly from Johnson himself through on intermediary. The materials picked up at Republican headquarters, including press releases and travel schedules, were delivered to a White House aide who was a former CIA official.
Testifying before the House Select Committee on Intelligence on November 6, 1975, CIA Director William Colby acknowledged that in 1964 a CIA official attached to the National Security Council prepared campaign material for Johnson and, with the help of another CIA employee, got advance texts of Goldwater's speeches and reported regularly on the campaign to the CIA.[4]

Civil rights violations
Two weeks before election day Johnson instructed Bill Moyers to transmit an order to the FBI to run checks on numerous members of Goldwater's campaign and Senate staffs in an effort to obtain derogatory information about their possible sexual aberrations. What Johnson was looking for, Moyers told the FBI, was information about ""fags"" on Goldwater's staff.[5]

Walter Jenkins
One month before the election, White House Chief of Staff Walter Jenkins was arrested in a pay toilet of the men's room of the YMCA, two blocks from the White House. It was not the first time Jenkins had been arrested on the same charge. The police had apprehended him in the same washroom in January 1959 in a similar homosexual episode.
Jenkins called Abe Fortas to say he was in serious trouble. Fortas tried to contact Lyndon Johnson who was campaigning in New York. When he was unable to do so, the Fortas acted on his own. He advised Jenkins to check into a hospital in order to be out of reach of reporters. At the same time Fortas and Clifford went to the offices of the Washington Post, Washington Star  and Daily News to hush up the story. United Press International however, broke the story. Meanwhile, the book at the police station containing the Jenkins' arrest record disappeared. But  a photograph of the particular police blotter had been taken. 
When the news broke there was public concern over Jenkins' access to classified information and his susceptibility to blackmail. LBJ asked FBI dire for J. Edgar Hoover to investigate. LBJ went even further, he told Hoover what the final report should say. Johnson suggested the report should state that Jenkins was overly tired, that he was a good family man and a hard worker, and that he was not ""biologically"" a homosexual.
Within the week Hoover sent the results of the FBI's ""extensive investigation"" over to Acting Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach. The FBI investigation, said the director, ""disclosed no information that Mr. Jenkins has compromised the security or interests of the United States in any manner."" The report, issued two weeks before the election, claimed
that ""a favorable appraisal of Mr. Jenkins' loyalty and dedication to the United States was given the FBI by more than three hundred of his associates, both business and social.""

5 Notes


Formation
The 1st ""Centauro"" Armoured Brigade was raised in April 1937, and, along with the 132nd ""Ariete"" Armoured Division, formed part of the Italian Armoured Corps. The two units took part in the first corps-level exercises in the Po Valley in the late 1930s. In February 1939, the ""Centauro"" was re-designated a division.

Invasion of Greece
When Italy invaded Albania in April 1939, the Centauro was equipped with L3/33 and L3/35 tankettes. The division also participated in the Greco-Italian War in 1940, just before it received its first M13/40 tanks in December, and deployed with them at Këlcyrë in January 1941, losing many of them to the Greek artillery fire.

Invasion of Yugoslavia
The following year the Centauro was deployed in Yugoslavia, together with the 4th Littorio Division, where they performed well despite their outdated equipment. In June 1941 they were recalled to Italy to be re-equipped.

North Africa
The Centauro arrived in North Africa during the Axis retreat from El Alamein to Tripoli in late 1942. On 13 December 1942, during the Battle of El Agheila, the Centauro along with a formation from the 132nd Ariete Armoured Division forced the British 7th Armoured Division to retreat. Rommel recorded the action in his diary:
Late in the morning, a superior enemy force launched an attack on Combat Group Ariete, which was located south-west of El Agheila, with its right flank resting on the Sebcha Chebira and its left linking up with 90th Light Division. Bitter fighting ensued against 80 British tanks and lasted for nearly ten hours. The Italians put up a magnificent fight, for which they deserved the utmost credit. Finally, in the evening, the British were thrown back by a counter attack of the Centauro's armoured regiment, leaving 22 tanks and 2 amoured cars burnt out or damaged on the battlefield. The British intention of cutting off the 90th Light Division had been foiled. [1]
The armoured division took part in several actions in the Tunisian Campaign and according to US historian Brian John Murphy (after leading the Axis armoured advance through Kasserine Pass), overran a good part of the US forces deployed along Highway 13 that were blocking the route to Tebessa during the Battle of Kasserine Pass:
Axis forces also made a breakthrough on Highway 13, where the Italians of the Centauro Division spearheaded the attack. In the early morning hours, the Italians pressed their offensive, broke through the remains of the American line, and continued up Highway 13.[2]
Tanks from the Centauro supported by the 5th Bersaglieri Regiment overran Colonel Anderson Moore's 19th Combat Engineers Regiment during this action. [3]The American newspaper Victoria Advocate reported:
Of the 1,200 men in the battalion on Feb. 18, 1943, only 125 remained the next day. The rest were killed, wounded, captured or scattered, as a battle-hardened war machine gave the untested U.S. Army a bloody baptism.[4]
The remaining units of the Centauro fought in Tunisia as part of the Italian 1st Army until the end of the campaign, surrendering on 13 May 1943, five days after the collapse of the 5th Panzer Armee. The German collapse started on 5 May, although Italian resistance stiffened around the defensive line north of Takrouna, with the Italians overrunning a French division in the last hours of the fighting. [5]In all, 80,000 Italians under Marshal Giovanni Messe laid down their arms on 13 May 1943, only when authorized to do so by Mussolini who promoted Messe to marshal the night before.

Moore, warned Stark by radio that enemy infantry and tanks were forcing the pass along Highway 13. An engineer major bellowed: ""Forget about our equipment and just save your life."" Artillery observers fled, explaining plausibly if ingloriously: ""This place is too hot. ""Companies disintegrated into platoons, platoons into squads, squads into solitary foot soldiers chased to the rear by screaming meemies. Half an hour later, Moore radioed, ""Enemy overrunning our C.P.,"" and bolted for high ground. He soon arrived at Stark's tent to announce that the 19th Engineers no longer existed.""

Stories of the 2007 NFL Draft
 Notre Dame star quarterback Brady Quinn fell to the pick number 22 of the draft before being picked by the Cleveland Browns. Quinn was expected to be drafted with one of the top ten picks of the draft.[1]
 Oakland Raiders talented, but troubled wide receiver Randy Moss was traded[2] to the New England Patriots for the first of New England's two forth round draft picks. The Raiders used the pick to draft University of Cincinnati cornerback John Bowie.	 
 For the last five years the Detroit Lions have drafted a wide receiver with four of their six first round picks. The Lions continued that trend by drafting star Georgia Tech wide receiver Calvin Johnson with the second pick of the draft. 
 Winning quarterbacks not being drafted high, or drafted at all: the 2006 Heisman Trophy winner, Ohio State University quarterback Troy Smith was not picked until the 174 pick,[3] while  University of Florida quarterback Chis Leak (who won the National Championship) was not drafted.

1995 Gorelick memo,https://www.conservapedia.com/1995_Gorelick_memo,"Jamie S. Gorelick served as Deputy Attorney General under Janet Reno. A significant part of the 9/11 commission's report considered whether she or Ashcroft was more to blame for the effects of the ""wall"" she created between CIA and FBI; see 1995 Gorelick memo.

 The 9/11 Commission’s inquiry into the ""wall"" that formerly separated U.S. intelligence from law enforcement operations has become a news story du jour. (Lew Rockwell)
 If Jamie Gorelick were a Republican, you can be sure our colleagues in the Fourth Estate would be leading the chorus of complaint that the Commission's objectivity has been fatally compromised by a member who was also one of the key personalities behind the failed antiterror policy that the Commission has under scrutiny. -- Wall Street Journal
The Wall Street Journal reported that:

During the investigation of the first World Trade Center bombing, Gorelick instructed then-FBI Director Louis Freeh and United States Attorney Mary Jo White that for the sake of ""appearances"" they would be required to adhere to an interpretation of the wall far stricter than the law required. [1]
Also in the Journal:

The Mary Jo White prosecutions and the 2001 Moussaoui arrest were among our best chances to uncover and unravel the al Qaeda network before it struck the homeland. But thanks in part to the Clinton Administration's concern with appearances and in part to its legacy, these investigations were hamstrung. [2]
Gorelick memo of 1995
The Gorelick memo of 1995 erected a ""wall"" between counter-intelligence and law enforcement, which impeded investigation of al Qaeda in the run-up to the 9/11 attacks. Jamie Gorelick, then working as Deputy Attorney General under Janet Reno was author of the memo.
The wall was nominally created in response to the ""legitimate fear that agents denied criminal warrants would gain information through the backdoor from their buddies working under FISA."" [1]
Scott Wheeler wrote:

Because the memo created a barrier for U.S. intelligence agencies to share information with the FBI, one of its unintended consequences might have been to prevent the FBI from receiving the necessary intelligence to stop the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the worst in American history.[2]
Attorney General John Ashcroft told the 9/11 commission:

""The simple fact of September 11th is this ... We did not know an attack was coming because for nearly a decade our government had blinded itself to its enemies. Our agents were isolated by government-imposed walls."" [3]
At issue in the hearings was whether Clinton, Reno and Gorelick or Bush and Ashcroft were more responsible for the effect the ""wall"" had. The Democrats acknowledged building the wall but blamed the Republicans for leaving it in place. The Republicans blamed the Democrats for building it in the first place.

 ""The Clinton administration neutered the American intelligence agencies that could have stopped the September 11 plot."" [4]
Jared Kushner
Gorelick was hired in 2017 to represent Jared Kushner, husband of Ivanka Trump and son-in-law of President Donald Trump to handle anti-nepotism charges and conflict of interest in the management of Trump's and Kushner's private business.[5]

 Jews at the Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement
The Yom Kippur War was fought between Israel, Egypt, and Syria.  The war commenced on October 6, 1973 when Egyptian mechanized divisions crossed the Suez Canal by using a series of pressurized water cannons to demolish sand walls on the opposite side of the canal, and then crossing on pontoon bridges.  This was concurrent to a Syrian advance into the Golan Heights.  The date was chosen because Yom Kippur is the holiest and most solemn day in Judaism, and many Israeli army were stood down during that time.  The delay in mobilization, and the lack of a preemptive strike against Egyptian and Syrian forces allowed the initial success of these advances.  However, the lack of commercial traffic (due to the solemnness of Yom Kippur) allowed Israeli forces to mobilize more quickly than usual.
At first, the Israeli counterattack was focussed primarily against the forces in the Golan Heights as these were much closer to Israel proper, whereas the Egyptian forces in the Sinai peninsula were not as immediate a threat.  Initial counterattacks against both armies were ineffective because the Israelis were hugely outnumbered in armor, although the Egyptians and Syrians were fielding obsolete Russian tanks as opposed to the more modern European and American tanks fielded by Israel.  To counter this advantage, the Arab armies armed their soldiers with Russian anti-tank weapons.  Additionally, both armies used fixed SAM emplacements, and avoided leaving the coverage of this air umbrella, thus blunting the offensive power of the Israeli air force.
Facing defeat, the Israelis implored the United States for military aid, as the Europeans refused to assist under threat of an Arab oil embargo.  The United States airlifted a large number of tanks and aircraft into Israel, thus replacing Israeli losses.  Because of the influx of materiel, the Israelis were able to commit their forces to a renewed offensive posture, overwhelming the older Egyptian and Syrian divisions.
Because the Israelis through the majority of their reserves into the Golan Heights theater, they were able to push back the Syrian advance, and counterattack into Syria, though this counterattack was ultimately turned back by a combined Syrian, Jordanian, and Iraqi force.  In the Sinai, after several attacks and counterattacks, both sides went into a defensive stance to hold the ground that they had.  On October 14, the Egyptian forces decided to attack first, but made a tactical blunder in attacking the Israelis head on and outside of their SAM umbrella.  The Egyptian tanks were decimated by the superior Israeli armor and air power.  The following day, the Israelis counterattacked across the Suez canal.
By October 23, the Israeli army, though pushed back from the outskirts of Damascus, still had captured additional territory near the Golan Heights, and was close to encircling the Egyptian army in the Sinai peninsula.  The United Nations chose this time to impose a cease fire which went into effect at sundown on the 23rd.  However, overnight the Israeli army continued its attack in Egyptian territory in order to complete the encirclement of the Egyptians.  In a conference with Golda Meir that evening, Henry Kissinger asked ""how can anyone ever know where a line is or was in the desert?""  Their army now encircled, the Egyptians had no choice but to accept the cease fire in exchange for the creation of UN checkpoints to allow non-military supplies to reach their army, and the exchange of prisoners of war.  Although the cease fire did not bind the Syrians, they decided not to further counterattack the Israeli army, though their combined force of Syrian, Iraqi, and Jordanian troops had the Israelis in a state of retreat.
Ultimately, the cease fire led to an armistice, and the Camp David accords wherein Egypt agreed to a lasting peace in exchange for the return of the Sinai peninsula, which the Egyptians had lost during the Six Day War, and the recovery of which had been the primary goal of the Yom Kippur War.  However, the airlifting of supplies by the United States to the Israelis directly precipitated the 1973 OPEC oil embargo.

2010 Midterm elections,https://www.conservapedia.com/2010_Midterm_elections," In the 2010 Midterm Elections, the Republican Party gained 63 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and six seats in the U.S. Senate from the Democratic Party. Republicans also gained six governorships, including Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan.  Republicans gained 680 seats in state legislatures, the most in the modern era.[1]
Republicans gained the most House seats since the 1938 Midterm Elections, giving Republicans their biggest House majority, and Democrats their smallest minority, since 1946.  When blue dog Democrats are added to the Republicans on certain issues like gun control or marriage, the Republican majority is even greater than in 1946.
Democratic loses could be attributed to public rejection of the socialistic policies of the Obama administration. The public disapproved of President Obama's economic policies. In the days leading up to the election, a majority of voters supported repealing/replacing The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, sixty-five percent of voters said that the economic stimulus package either hurt the economy or did no good,[2] and fifty-four percent of those voting said they were dissatisfied with the performance of Barack Obama. Given the high level of Democratic success in the 2006 and 2008 elections, they were also put in the position of having to defend a large number of seats.
John Boehner (R-Ohio), become Speaker of the House in the 112th Congress, exchanging places with Nancy Pelosi (D-California). By tradition Pelosi would be expected to resign her leadership position after such a stunning repudiation by the electorate, but as a self-centered liberal she insisted on becoming the next Minority Leader.

2009 elections
In the Nov. 3, 2009, off-year elections, defeat was the fate of Democrats in New York City, New Jersey and Virginia. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent, spent his way to a third term in New York City while Republican Bob McDonnell won in a landslide for governor of Virginia; in New Jersey Republican Christopher Christie ousted the incumbent Democrat Jon Corzine despite his millions and Obama's campaigning.
Conservatives scored a major internal party victory in Oct. 2009 by forcing the Republican candidate Dede Scozzafava out of a House race in New York's 23rd district, for being too liberal. The Conservative Party candidate was defeated by the Democrat, however, opening up recriminations between GOP officials and conservatives on why the district was lost for the first time since 1992. Conservative activists zeroed in on the 2010 race for Florida's open Senate seat, in which the Republican party Senate campaign committee endorsed moderate Gov. Charlie Crist but the more conservative Marco Rubio mounted a successful challenge. ""If I were Charlie Crist in Florida, what's happening in New York 23 would make me extremely nervous,"" GOP strategist Todd Harris said. ""A lot of the establishment Republicans underestimated the grass-roots anger across the country about spending and the expansion of the federal government. The anger is boiling over now, but a lot of the seeds of discontent were planted over the last five to six years.""[3]

Ad campaigns
 Cartoonist Michael Ramirez of Investor's Business Daily captures the tone of the 2010 Midterm elections.
In late 2009 national money was being poured into nine districts, where Democrats who voted for their party's health care reform may be in trouble. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, representing business, has spent at least $1.6 million in November.  Liberals shoot back against the Chamber and 60 Plus Association with ads targeting 12 Democrats and one Republican who supported health reform. Three liberal groups, Americans United for Change and the labor unions AFSCME and SEIU are teaming up for $1.75 million worth of counter-messaging on broadcast and cable TV in the districts of Reps. Berry, Cao, Connolly, Donnelly, Ellsworth, Hill, Hodes, Michaud, Murphy, Perriello, Pomeroy, Snyder and Titus.
In mid-October the Democratic National Committee, echoing charges debunked[4] by the New York Times, insinuated that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce was using ""foreign money"" to fund ads criticizing Democrats. The president said in a Maryland stump speech, ""we learned that one of the largest groups paying for these ads regularly takes in money from foreign corporations. So groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence American elections, and they won't tell you where the money for their ads comes from…. This is a threat to our democracy."" 
The president himself has received $543,219 from Swiss banking giant UBS AG,[5] a foreign banking corporation which was later fined a record $780 million for its part in helping the rich evade U.S. income taxes.[6] Columnist Ruben Navarrette warned the pitfalls of playing the ""foreign card"" is



 “

 both offensive and dangerous. It exploits people's fears of the unknown and appeals to the prejudice that many of us feel toward those who are different. It also fuels ugly nativist instincts that -- once unleashed -- can do real damage....Democrats know this better than anyone ... The birther movement, which suggests that Obama was actually born in Kenya and thus not eligible to serve as a president, is all about playing the foreign card...[7]

 ”


Commentator Charles Krauthammer called the unfounded attacks on the Chamber of Commerce a baseless McCarthyite smear,[8] while columinst Jacob Sullum wrote,



 “

 Obama's attempt to discredit his opponents by linking them to sinister outsiders reminds us that neither major party has a monopoly on xenophobia. To some extent, crying ""foreigner"" reflects the president's desperation in the face of the Democrats' looming midterm losses.[9]

 ”


Pre-election Forecasts
In recent years, as the chart shows, the incumbent party loses an average of 16 House seats.  The GOP needed 39 seats to win back the House.  
Democrats had to defend about 60 marginal House seats in 2010, as opposed to about 40 for Republicans. At high risk were 27 Democratic seats and just 13 Republican seats that may see a party switch.
Election forecasters in September 2009 were revising their predictions downward for the Democrats, as Obama's popularity continues to plunge. From April to August, Obama lost 10 points across the board—suffering losses in every group except blacks, who remain loyal to him.[10] The popularity of Congress remains low. Starting in January 2010 the number of Americans who identify themselves as Democrats was at a seven-year low.[11] The Republican party, however, suffers from a lack of leaders and its own poor reputation in voter esteem.
""No question, August proved cathartic for voters and chaotic for congressional Democrats. But way before the town hall meetings during recess, there were ample signs for Democrats to fear for their careers in 2010,"" concluded Cook Political Report House analyst David Wasserman, who predicts the Democrats will lose 20 seats in the House, but retain control.[12]  Wasserman concludes that a major shift has been underway among ""angry white seniors"" (over age 60), who strongly dislike the Obama health care proposals because they fear they will lose benefits they now have. 
Analyst Stuart Rothenberg reported that, ""Growing public concern about spending, taxes and the size of government has started to shift the national landscape away from the Democrats to a more neutral position, and quite possibly toward the GOP.""[13] Furthermore, an advantage for Republicans was that 48 House Democrats, 8 more than the size of their majority, come from districts that voted for both George W. Bush and John McCain.[14]
Columnist Rich Galen observed,



 “

 He railroaded his signature legislation - Obamacare - through the Congress costing his party 60+ seats in the 2010 mid-term election and guaranteeing GOP control of the House for the foreseeable future. Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi will go down in history as enablers of the sacrifice of Obama's Congressional allies on the alter of his enormous ego.[15]

Senate
Texas Senator John Cornyn, the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, quietly put Senate Republicans in a position to benefit as the national political environment went negative toward Democrats, and was successful in narrowing the Democratic majority. Without losing any of their seats, the Republican Party defeated two incumbents, Blanche Lincoln (D-Arkansas) and Russ Feingold (D-Wisconsin), and won four Democratic-held open seats: Illinois, Indiana, North Dakota, and Pennsylvania. Additionally, Republican Scott Brown was elected to replace the late Senator Ted Kennedy (D-Massachusetts) in a January special election.  

Republican Gains
Arkansas
Moderate Democrat Blanche Lincoln was defeated by 21 percentage points after Republicans made her one of their top targets in 2010. In the 2008 Presidential Election, Arkansas was one of the few states where John McCain exceeded George W. Bush’s margin, despite the national trend favoring Democrats. Generally, she voted the party line with President Obama, which angered her conservative constituents, but also voted against the Employee Free Choice Act (card check) and opposed to the public option in health care, which angered liberals. She began airing TV ads in March touting her independence from President Obama and national Democrats. Lincoln defeated Lieutenant Governor Bill Halter in a close runoff for the Democratic nomination.
Third district Congressman John Boozman easily won the Republican nomination, defeating State Senator Gilbert Baker and former State Senator Jim Holt. Boozman comfortably led thoughout the entire campaign.

Indiana
Two-term Democrat Evan Bayh dropped out of his reelection in February after polls showed he may be vulnerable after his vote for the economic stimulus package and government-run health care. Former Republican U.S. Senator Dan Coats, who predeced Bayh after retiring in 1998, announced his candidacy for his old Senate seat. Former six-term Congressman John Hostettler, State Senator Marlin Stutzman and businessman Don Bates Jr. were defeated for the Republican nomination. Conservative Congressman Mike Pence considered running, but instead chose to seek reelection in the House.
8th district Congressman Brad Ellsworth was the Democratic nominee. Dan Coats defeated Ellsworth by a 55%-40% margin. Ellsworth supported President Obama’s health care plan in a state where opposition to the legislation is higher than it was nationally.[16]

Illinois
Democratic Senator Roland Burris had been plagued by controversies. Burris was appointed to replace Barack Obama by Governor Rod Blagojevich, who had been arrested on a variety of federal corruption charges (including for trying to ""sell"" Obama's Senate seat). Burris was then accused of committing perjury after he admitted to not testifying truthfully at a committee investigating Governor Blagojevich. Burris announced he would not seek a full term in 2010.
Moderate-GOP Congressman Mark Kirk, representing a Democratic-leaning district that covers suburban Chicago, easily won the Republican nomination, while Illinois State Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias defeated Chicago Inspector General David Hoffman in a close primary. Both candidates faced negative media publicity, Giannoulias for the collapse of his family bank, and Kirk for exaggerating his military record. In the general election, Kirk defeated Giannoulias by a 48%-46% margin.

Massachusetts
Republican State Senator Scott Brown pulled a major upset when he defeated Attorney General Martha Coakley by a 52%-47% margin.
Liberal icon Ted Kennedy, the third longest-serving Senator in U.S. history, died in August 2009, marking the end of an era. During the 2004 Presidential Election the Democratic super-majority in the state legislator blocked the right of Republican Governor Mitt Romney to appoint an interim senator had John Kerry been elected President. After changing the law to allow Governor Deval Patrick, a Democrat, the right to appoint a temporary replacement for Kennedy, he choose former Democratic National Committee chairman Paul Kirk. He did not seek a full term of his own, and a special election was held on January 19, 2010. 
State Attorney General Martha Coakley won the Democratic primary, defeating businessman Alan Khazei, Representative Mike Capuano, and Boston Celtics co-owner Stephen Pagliuca. Charismatic State Senator Scott Brown was the Republican nominee.[17]

 a last minute appeal
It was a safe Democratic seat until January, when Democrats reeled in shock as Coakley lost her 30-point lead and trailed by 5-10 points in the closing hours. Coakley was an ineffective machine-style insider candidate who was unable to reach independents. Brown's main theme was that he would be the 41st senator and would block the Obama health care plan—which Massachusetts did not need, he explained, because it had its own plan in operation. Coakley responded by attacking bankers and bringing in big guns like Bill Clinton, John Kerry and Barack Obama. They appealed to regular Democrats and alienated the equally numerous independents, who preferred Brown by more than 2-1. 
The defeat for Coakley, coming on the heels of the Democrats' loss of Virginia and New Jersey in Nov. 2009, was a major blow to the liberal caused and reinvigorated the Republican party nationally.

North Dakota
Byron Dorgan, a three-term Democrat Senator from North Dakota, announced he would not seek reelection. Dorgan's announcement represented an opportunity for Republicans, after popular Governor John Hoeven announced his candidacy.[18] Hoeven defeated State Senator Tracy Potter by a 76%-22% margin, carrying every county.

Pennsylvania
After polls showed him losing the Republican primary by as much as 20 points, Arlen Specter simply changed party affiliation to Democrat. Despite full support by President Obama and virtually every elected Democrat in Pennsylvania as well as nearly every major newspaper, Specter went on to lose the Democratic nomination to 7th-district Congressman Joe Sestak in the primary, and faced former 15th district Congressman and Club for Growth President Pat Toomey, known for his economic conservatism. In the general election, Toomey defeated Sestak by a 51%-49% margin.

Wisconsin
Three-term incumbent Russ Feingold had positioned himself for a comfortable reelection after former governor and Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson announced he would not run. However, Tea Party activist and Oshkosh businessman Ron Johnson defeated Feingold by a 52%-47% margin.

Democratic Holds
California
Although California is a solidly Democratic state, conservatives originally saw outspoken liberal Senator Barbara Boxer as vulnerable. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was term-limited in 2010, announced he would not run. Former Hewlett-Packard Company President Carly Fiorina defeated former U.S. Rep. Tom Campbell and Assemblyman Chuck DeVore in the Republican primary. Boxer defeated Fiorina by ten percentage points.

Colorado
Appointed Democratic Senator Michael Bennet was narrowly reelected. Former Speaker of the Colorado House of Representatives Andrew Romanoff was defeated in his bid to challenge Bennet for the Democratic nomination, while Weld County District Attorney Ken Buck defeated former Lieutenant Governor Jane Norton in the Republican primary. 

Connecticut
30-year Senate veteran Chris Dodd announced he would not seek a sixth term. Dodd's approval ratings plummeted after his failed presidential campaign in 2008, his controversial mortgage deal from Countrywide, and revelations about the $165 million bonuses for AIG executives that he attached in an amendment to the economic stimulus package, despite receiving federal bailout money. Popular state Attorney General Richard Blumenthal won the Democratic nomination, increasing the Democrats' chances of holding the seat. However, his poll numbers dropped after a New York Times report revealed that he exaggerated his military record.
Republicans nominated World Wrestling Entertainment CEO Linda McMahon, defeating former Congressman Rob Simmons and libertarian-leaning economist Peter Schiff, a stock broker and adviser to Ron Paul’s 2008 presidential campaign. Blumenthal won the general election by a 55%-43% margin.

Delaware
Joe Biden was simultaneously elected to a seventh term in the Senate and Vice President at the same time. Democratic Governor Ruth Ann Minner appointed a ""caretaker"" Senator, Ted Kaufman. Michael Castle, a moderate Republican who also served as Governor and Lieutenant Governor, was heavily favored to win the Republican nomination. However, Tea Party backed insurgent Christine O’Donnell ousted Castle in the primary, improving New Castle County Executive Chris Coons chances in holding the seat for Democrats. The Republican Party had a mixed reaction to O’Donnell's victory. She had caused controversy regarding her views on creationism and Christian values. Coons defeated O’Donnell by a 57%-40% margin.

Hawaii
Democrat Daniel Inouye easily won reelection against Republican Representative Campbell Cavasso.

Maryland
Entrenched incumbent Barbara Mikulski easily won reelection, defeating physician and Queen Anne's County Commissioner Eric Wargotz.

Nevada
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid faced a competitive reelection in 2010. The ""Cook Political Report"" in September 2009 rateed the contest as ""Toss Up."" His status weakened in summer 2009, as discontent with President Obama and the Democrats' health plan mounted, and as the Recession of 2008 continues to batter Las Vegas and the entire Nevada economy, with no relief in sight from the stimulus bill Reid pushed through the Senate. Reid's inability to improve his standing in the polls, coupled with the deteriorating political environment for Democrats nationally, were clear indications that his political problems are deep and will be difficult (though not impossible) to fix, says Cook. 
After receiving the endorsement of the Tea Party Express and Club for Growth, former Assemblywoman Sharron Angle defeated former State Senator Sue Lowden and businessman Danny Tarkanian in the Republican primary. Reid defeated Angle by a 50%-45% margin.

New York
Senior Senator Charles Schumer was considered the safest incumbent of 2010 and won his reelection by a 66%-33% margin against Republican Jay Townsend.

New York-Special Election
Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand was appointed by Governor David Patterson to replace Hillary Clinton after much confusion on his part. Patterson mishandled the proposed appointment of Caroline Kennedy, gaining ridicule for both of them.  Gillibrand's moderate views alienated the left wing of the Democratic Party. Former Tennessee Congressman Harold Ford, Jr. has announced he will not seek a primary challenge to Gillibrand.
Nine-term Congressman Peter King has declined to run. Republicans are tried but failed to recruit former Governor George Pataki, who ran ahead in the polls with Gillibrand. Real estate billionaire Mort Zuckerman, despite having a record of supporting liberal causes, was mentioned as a possible Republican or Independent candidate to avoid a primary, however announced that he would not run. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani declined to seek the Senate seat.[19] Instead, Republicans nominated former Congressman Joseph DioGuardi, whom Gillibrand defeated by a 62%-36% margin.

Oregon
Democratic Senator Ron Wyden defeated his Republican challenger, Lewis & Clark College law professor Jim Huffman by a 57%-39% margin. 

Vermont
Patrick Leahy, the third most senior U.S. Senator, was reelected by a 64%-40% margin against Republican Len Britton.

Washington
Polls show that Senator Patty Murray, once considered well positioned for reelection, would face a competitive race against Washington's former state Senator, Dino Rossi. In November, Murray defeated Rossi by a 52%-48% margin.

West Virginia
Popular Democratic Governor Joe Manchin was elected to replace the late Exalted Cyclops Senator Robert Byrd. Businessman and 2006 nominee John Raese made the race surprisingly close by tying Manchin to the Obama administration.

Republican Holds
Alabama
Senior Senator Richard Shelby, who was originally elected as a conservative Democrat but changed party affiliation to Republican after the 1994 Republican Revolution, was handedly reelected, as he was in 1992, 1998, and 2004. 

Alaska 
Lisa Murkowski won a term for the U.S. Senate in her own right in 2004 by a close 48%-45% margin, however, in 2010 she lost the Primary Election against Joe Miller, a Conservative candidate and Tea Party favorite. Democrats nominated Sitka, Alaska Mayor Scott McAdams. Murkowski pursued her campaign as a write-in candidate, and was reelected with a 39% plurality, while Miller received 35% and McAdams 23%. She has the distinction of being the first person elected to the Senate via write-in since Strom Thurmond in 1954. 

Arizona
Senior Senator John McCain, the Republicans presidential nominee in 2008, caught a break when Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano was appointed Secretary of Homeland Security. However, former Congressman J. D. Hayworth challenged McCain in a primary, but was defeated by a 56%-32% margin. McCain went on to defeat Tucson City Councilor Rodney Glassman by a 59%-35% margin. 

Florida
Republican Governor Charlie Crist, who once enjoyed high approval ratings, appointed George LeMieux upon the resignation of Senator Mel Martinez. LeMieux held the seat temporarily for Governor Crist who decided to run for the Senate. He was the establishment pick for the Republican nomination, but was challenged by conservative Florida House Speaker and Tea Party backed candidate Marco Rubio, who led by 32 points according to Public Policy Polling.[20] Crist announced he would drop out of the Republican primary and run as an Independent. 
Crist alienated conservatives when he campaigned with President Obama in support for the $787 billion economic stimulus package, which was entirely opposed by the Florida Republican federal delegation. Democrats nominated 17th district Congressman Kendrick Meek, who defeated billionaire businessman Jeff Greene. Rubio was elected with a 49% plurality, defeating Crist who received 30% and Meek who received 20%. 

Georgia
First-term Senator Johnny Isakson's had solid standing for his reelection. His most formidable Democratic opponent, state Attorney General Thurbert Baker, instead sought a campaign for Governor. Isakson defeated Labor Commissioner Mike Thurmond by a 58%-39% margin.

Idaho
Mike Crapo's conservative voting record goes along with the Republican stronghold of Idaho. In 2004, he faced no Democratic challenger and won reelection with over 99% of the vote. Crapo's seat was one of the safest in the 2010 election cycle, and he won reelection by a 71%-25% margin.

Iowa
30-year incumbent Charles Grassley is one of the most distinguished and influential Republican Senators in Washington (he serves as ranking member of the Finance Committee). He was reelected by a 65%-33% margin against former U.S. Attorney Roxanne Conlin, carrying all but one county.

Kansas
Incumbent Republican Sam Brownback honored his campaign pledge to serve only two terms. 1st district Congressman Jerry Moran defeated 4th district Congressman Todd Tiahrt for the Republican nomination by a 50%-45% margin, while Democrats nominated Lisa Johnston, an administrator at Baker University. Moran defeated Johnston by a 70%-26% margin. 

Kentucky
Republicans had a victory when unpopular incumbent Senator Jim Bunning announced he would not seek a third term. Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson sought the Republican nomination, however was defeated by Tea Party activist Rand Paul, an eye surgeon who is the son of Texas Congressman Ron Paul. Paul received the endorsment of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin.[21] On the Democratic side, Lieutenant Governor Daniel Mongiardo (who lost to Bunning in 2004) was defeated by Attorney General Jack Conway. Paul campaigned on a reducation in taxion and spending, and won the support of conservatives and libertarians alike. Paul defeated Conway by a 56%-44% margin.

Louisiana
Louisiana, a conservative state, was not effected by the national trend for Democrats in 2006 and 2008. Republican Bobby Jindal was elected Governor by a landslide in 2007, in 2008 John McCain received a larger margin of victory in the state than George W. Bush in 2004, while the GOP gained two House seats from the Democrats. Yet first-term Republican David Vitter was considered to be vulnerable for his reelection after he confessed in 2007 to seeing an escort service, which has tainted his career. Third-district Congressman Charlie Melancon won the Democratic nomination. Vitter defeated Melancon by a 57%-38% margin.

Missouri
Incumbent Republican Senator Kit Bond announced he will not seek fifth term. Former House Majority Whip Roy Blunt announced his candidacy. Blunt benefited from strong fundraising numbers and President Obama's dismal approval ratings in Missouri. Secretary of State Robin Carnahan won the Democratic nomination. BLunt defeated Carnahan by a 54%-41% margin.

New Hampshire
Senior Republican Senator Judd Gregg, after withdrawing from a position in the Obama administration, announced he will not seek a fourth term. 2nd district Congressman Paul Hodes won the Democratic nomination, while Republicans nominated former New Hampshire Attorney General Kelly Ayotte. Ayotte defeated Hodes by a 60%-37% margin.

North Carolina
First-term Republican Richard Burr was considered vulnerable after Barack Obama won North Carolina's 15 electoral votes by a narrow margin, and Democrat Kay Hagan defeated Republican Senator Elizabeth Dole. It is also worth noting that no Senator has held this seat for more than one term since 1974. Secretary of State Elaine Marshall defeated former State Senator Cal Cunningham and Attorney Ken Lewis in the Democratic primary. Burr was reelected by a 55%-43% margin.

Ohio
Moderate Republican George Voinovich announced he would not seek a third term. Lieutenant Governor Lee Fisher won the Democratic nomination over Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner with 55% of the vote, a much closer margin than polls had shown.[22] Fisher received the endorsement of Democratic Governor Ted Strickland. Meanwhile, Republicans rallied behind Rob Portman, former Congressman and Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Although polls originally showed a tight race, Portman defeated Fisher by a 57%-39% margin.

Oklahoma
Tom Coburn was elected to a second term by a 71%-26% margin against Democrat Jim Rogers.

South Carolina
First-term Republican Jim DeMint, whose reputation as an outspoken conservative, has not hurt him in the Republican stronghold of South Carolina. Democrats nominated an unconventional candidate, Alvin Greene, an unemployed Army veteran who was indicted on criminal charges for showing pornographic pictures to a teenage college student.[23] DeMint defeated Greene by a 61%-28% margin.  

South Dakota
In 2004, John Thune defeated Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, and his victory quickly made him a rising star in the Republican Party. Thune ran unopposed in his reelection.[24]

Utah 
Three-term Senator Robert Bennett represents a state that John McCain won by over thirty-percentage points and was expected to win reelection by a comfortable margin. However, he was defeated in the Republican caucus to Mike Lee and Tim Bridgewater after his vote for TARP. Bennett ruled out a write-in campaign, and Lee went on to win the Republican primary and general election.

Governors
In the 2010 gubernatorial elections, the Democratic Party won five governorships held by retiring Republicans: California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Minnesota, and Vermont. The Republican Party won nine governorships from retiring Democrats: Kansas, Oklahoma, Maine, Michigan, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Wisconsin, Wyoming, and defeated two incumbents, Chet Culver of Iowa and Ted Strickland of Ohio. An Independent was elected Governor of Rhode Island to replace a retiring Republican, and a Republican was elected Governor of Florida to replace an Independent. Thus, Republicans had a net gain of six governorships, and the majority of Governors in the United States flipped from Democrat to Republican. Republicans also won the governorships of New Jersey and Virginia from the Democrats in the 2009 elections.

Democratic Gains
California
Incumbent Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger was prohibited from seeking reelection because of term-limits. Schwarzenegger was elected in 2003 after a recall of Governor Gray Davis and reelected in a landslide in 2006. However, Schwarzenegger's popularity, along with the Democratic assembly, fell because of the California budget crisis. State Attorney General and former Governor Jerry Brown won the Democratic nomination. On the Republican side, former Ebay CEO Meg Whitman defeated State Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner.
San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom was seeking the Democratic nomination, however dropped out in October 2009 after lackluster poll numbers and meager fund-raising receipts.[25] In the general election, Brown defeated Whitman by a 53%-42% margin.

Connecticut
M. Jodi Rell, despite being a Republican Governor from a blue state, was reelected with 63% of the vote in 2006 and had high approval ratings throughout her tenure as governor. However, she announced she would not run for another term.[26] Lieutenant Governor Michael Fedele announced his candidacy, but was defeated for the Republican nomination by former U.S. Ambassador Tom Foley. Democrats chose Stamford Mayor Dan Malloy over former U.S. Senate candidate Ned Lamont. After a recount, Malloy was confirmed to have won the governorship by a 50%-49% margin.

Hawaii 
Republican Governor Linda Lingle was term-limited. James Aiona, who served as the state's Lieutenant Governor eight years, ran to become her successor, but was defeated by 10-term Congressman Neil Abercrombie by a 58%-41% margin.

Minnesota
Two-term Governor Tim Pawlenty announced he would not seek another term, and became a potential 2012 GOP presidential candidate. Republican State Representative Tom Emmer and former Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Dayton won their parties nominations, respectively. After a recount, Dayton was confirmed to have won by a 0.5% margin.  

Vermont
Although a solidly Democratic state (Barack Obama won it with over 67% of the vote) Republican Jim Douglas was elected governor in 2002 and reelected in 2004, 2006, and 2008. Douglas announced he would not run for another term, and Republicans nominated Lieutenant Governor Brian Dubie. Democratic State Senator Peter Shumlin defeated Dubie by a 50%-48% margin in the general election.

Independent Gains
Rhode Island
Although Democrats have dominated Rhode Island politics, they have voted Republican for 7 of the last 10 gubernatorial elections. As Rhode Island was hit hard by the national recession, Republican Governor Donald Carcieri suffered in the polls, and was barred from seeking a third term because of term-limits. Lincoln Chafee, former Senator who was known as the most liberal Republican in Congress, was elected Governor as an Independent, defeating Republican John Robitaille and Democrat Frank Caprio. After President Obama refused to endorse Caprio, he caused controversy by telling Obama to take his endorsement and ""shove it."" [27]

Republican Gains
Florida
Republican turned Independent Governor Charlie Crist announced he would not seek a second term and instead run for the United States Senate, resulting in an open race. State Attorney General Bill McCollum was heavily favored to win the Republican nomination, but was defeated by Rick Scott, a millionaire health care executive and activist against federal health care legislation. Democrats nominated Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink, who led Scott in most of the polls following the primary. Scott's campaign emphasized conservative policies such as expanding school choice, abolishing the corporate income tax, and firing state employees.[28] He won the general election by a narrow 49%-48% margin. 

Iowa
Chet Culver, who was elected governor in 2006 riding on a Democratic wave, was defeated in a competitive reelection. Culver governed as a progressive in a swing state, increasing the minimum wage and raising the cigarette tax. His job approval ratings fell as the economy continued to falter. Former Governor Terry Branstad defeated Culver by a 53%-43% margin.

Kansas
Kathleen Sebelius, a Democratic Governor from the Republican-stronghold of Kansas, stepped down after being nominated to serve as Secretary of Health and Human Services in the Obama administration. Lieutenant Governor Mark Parkinson, a former Republican, took her place, and announced he would not seek a full term. Senator Sam Brownback was the Republican nominee, and defeated Democratic state Senator Tom Holland by a 63%-32% margin.

Maine
Democrat Governor John Baldacci was term-limited by state law, and Republicans saw it as an opportunity to gain the governorship. Republicans nominated Waterville, Maine Mayor Paul LePage, who defeated Independent candidate Eliot Cutler and Democratic state Senate President Libby Mitchell with a 38% plurarly. 

Michigan
Democratic Governor Jennifer Granholm suffered in her job approval ratings as the Michigan economy, heavily dependent of the auto industry, continued to falter throughout the 2000s. She was legally barred from seeking a third-term under state law. The Republican nominee, former President and COO of Gateway, Inc. Rick Snyder, easily defeated Democrat Lansing Mayor Virgil Bernero by a 58%-40% margin in the general election.

New Mexico
Democratic Governor Bill Richardson was nominated by President Obama to serve as Secretary of Commerce, however was forced to resign after it was exposed that his administration had a ""pay-to-play"" deal with a defense contractor. Richardson denied any wrongdoing. Although he was popular for most of his tenure, and handedly reelected in 2006, his approval ratings fell to 28% as the economy declined.[29] As he was term-limited in 2010, Lieutenant Governor Diane Denish won the Democratic Party nomination. The Republican nomination went to District Attorney Susana Martinez, and narrowly led in the polls throughout the campaign. She defeated Denish by a 54%-46% margin, becoming the first Hispanic woman elected governor in the United States. 

Ohio
Incumbent Democrat Ted Strickland faced sagging approval ratings and tough reelection prospects as Ohio lost jobs and population during his governorship. His Republican opponent, John Kasich – a former Congressman and Chairman of the House Budget Committee in the 1990s – campaigned on phasing out the state income tax, leasing the state's toll roads, cutting 15-20 percent of the state's higher education funds, and relaxing sentences on nonviolent offenders to cut down prison costs.[30] He defeated Strickland by a 49%-47% margin.

Oklahoma
Democratic Governor Brad Henry could not run for reelection because of term limits. Republicans nominated U.S. Representative Marry Fallin, who defeated Lieutenant Governor Jari Askins, becoming the first woman elected governor of Oklahoma.

Pennsylvania
Democratic Governor Ed Rendell was term limited in 2010. Democrats nominated Allegheny County Chief Executive Dan Onorato. Republicans nominated Attorney General Tom Corbett. 6th district Congressman Jim Gerlach was a Republican candidate, however dropped out in January and sought reelection instead. In the general election Corbett defeated Onorato by a 55%-45% margin.

Tennessee
Democratic Governor Phil Bredesen was term limited and unable to seek reelection. Tennessee, a conservative-leaning state, elected Knoxville Republican mayor Bill Haslam over Democrat Mike McWherter.

Democratic Holds
Arkansas
Centrist Democrat Mike Beebe enjoyed high approval ratings throughout his tenure as Governor. He was reelected by a 65%-34% margin against former Republican State Senate Jim Keet, despite Republicans making strong inroads in the traditionally Democratic supporting Arkansas during the 2010 election.

Colorado 
Despite Democratic success in Colorado during the 2006 and 2008 elections, incumbent Governor Bill Ritter announced his retirement after the prospects of a difficult reelection. His policies of higher taxes and unionization of state employees earned him criticism from the business community, and his approval ratings fell to 45%.[31] Former Congressman Scott McInnis was favored to win the Republican nomination, however fell in the polls after a controversy regarding plagiarizing an article, and was defeated by businessman and political newcomer Dan Maes, who also received criticism for misrepresenting his law enforcement background in the 1980s. Meanwhile, former Congressman Tom Tancredo entered the race in the American Constitution Party, and surged towards the end of the campaign. The turmoil made is easier for Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper to hold the Governors office for the Democrats, and was elected 50% of the vote, to Tancredo's 37% and Maes 11%.

Illinois
Democratic Governor Pat Quinn was installed as governor after the impeachment of Rod Blagojevich, and announced he would seek a full term. Quinn narrowly won the Democratic nomination against State Comptroller Dan Hynes. State Senator Bill Brady won the Republican nomination, defeating State Senator Kirk Dillard, and former State GOP chair Andrew McKenna. In the general election, Quinn pulled somewhat of an upset, winning reelection by a 47%-46% margin.  

Maryland
Democrat Martin O'Malley will likely run for a second term in 2010. O'Malley's approval ratings fell to 33% after a series of tax increases. The race was expected to be competitive with former Governor Robert Ehrlich seeking a rematch, however O'Malley was reelected by 14 percentage points.    

Massachusetts
Deval Patrick, although a Democratic Governor from a blue state, faced a difficult reelection after a disappointing performance as governor. The Republican nominee was health care executive Charlie Baker. Patrick was reelected with a 48% plurality, with Baker receiving 42% and Independent Paul Loscocco 8%.

New York
After Democratic Governor Eliot Spitzer resigned in disgrace when it was revealed that he was involved in a prostitution ring, Lieutenant Governor David Paterson took office. Governor Paterson's approval ratings plummeted to 21% [32] after his handling of the state budget crisis, his mismanagement of filling in the appointment of Hillary Clinton's vacant Senate seat, and a proposed number of tax increases. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani declined to seek the governorship and endorsed former Congressman Rick Lazio. 
President Barack Obama in Sept. 2009 contacted Paterson, asking him not to seek reelection in 2010 in that he cannot recover from his dismal political standing. Democrats nominated a stronger candidate, State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo. Republicans nominated Tea Party favorite and real estate developer Carl Paladino. Polls originally showed a tightening race, however a series of missteps resulted in Cuomo being handedly elected with over 60-percent of the vote.  

Oregon
Incumbent Governor Ted Kulongoski could not seek a third term. Democrats nominated John Kitzhaber, who served as governor from 1995 until 2003. He defeated former NBA player Chris Dudley in the general election by a 49%-48% margin.

Republican Holds
Alabama
Republican Governor Bob Riley is term-limited after two terms, and both parties faced a competitive primary. State Agriculture Commissioner Ron Sparks trounced 7th district Congressman Artur Davis for the Democratic nomination, while State Representative and physician Robert Bentley defeated former State Senator Bradley Byrne in the Republican runoff. Bentley led in the polls by twenty points throughout the campaign, and was elected by a 58%-42% margin. Republicans have won 6 out of the last 7 gubernatorial elections in Alabama, and John McCain won its 9 electoral votes by 60-percentage points.

Alaska
Sarah Palin, one-term Governor and former Vice-Presidential nominee, resigned on July 3, 2009 and Lieutenant Governor Sean Parnell inherited the governorship. Although Democrats nominated a formidable challenger, former State House Minority Leader Ethan Berkowitz, Parnell was elected to a full term by a 59%-38% margin.  

Arizona 
After Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano was nominated by President Obama to serve as Secretary of Homeland Security, Arizona Secretary of State Janice K. Brewer, a Republican, succeeded her. She announced that she would seek a full term.[33] In the beginning of 2010, Brewer was considered to be one of the most vulnerable Republican Governors up for reelection. However, her popularity rose after signing a controversial illegal immigration law, and was reelected against state Attorney General Terry Goddard by a 55%-42% margin.

Georgia
In 2002, Sonny Perdue became the first Republican elected Governor of Georgia since reconstruction, and was reelected in 2006. However, he was term-limited in 2010. With an open race, former Governor Roy Barnes handedly defeated Attorney General Thurbert Baker in the Democratic primary, while Republicans narrowly nominated Congressman Nathan Deal over Secretary of State Karen Handel. Deal defeated Barnes by a 53%-43% margin+.

Guam
Guam Governor Felix P. Camacho, a Republican, was term limited in 2010. The Governors office stayed in Republican hands with the election of State Senator Eddie Calvo. 

Idaho
Butch Otter, governor of one of the most conservative states in the nation, was reelected by a 59%-33% margin.

Nebraska
Republican Governor Dave Heineman, who was easily reelected with 73% of the vote in 2006, was easily won another term with 74% of the vote.

Nevada
Republican Governor Jim Gibbons was defeated in the primary by former State Attorney General Brian Sandovalby. Gibbons was vulnerable for his reelection after a series of scandals in his administration, a messy divorce and lawsuit, his failure to examine the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste site, and his handling of the budget, brought his approval ratings down. Clark County Commissioner Rory Reid — son of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid - won the Democratic nomination. In the general election, Sandovalby defeated Reid by a 53%-42% margin.   

South Carolina
Republican Governor Mark Sanford's possible presidential ambitions for 2012 ended after it was exposed he was having an extramarital affair with a woman from Argentine. Sanford would not resign, however was barred from seeking a third term because of term limits. Both parties prepared for an open race. State Representative Nikki Haley defeated Congressman Gresham Barrett in the Republican primary. State Senator Vincent Sheheen won the Democratic nomination. Haley defeated Sheheen bu a 51%-47% margin, becoming the first woman elected Governor of South Carolina, and the second Indian-American elected Governor, next to Bobby Jindal of Louisiana. 

South Dakota
Two-term Republican Governor Mike Rounds could not run for a third-term because of term limits. Republicans nominated Lieutenant Governor Dennis Daugaard and Democrats nominated state Senate Minority Leader Scott Heidepriem. Daugaard defeated Heidepriem by a 62%-38% margin. 

Texas 
Former Lieutenant Governor under George W. Bush and now Governor, Rick Perry was elected for an unprecedented third consecutive term. Perry alienated some citizens with his support of the Trans-Texas Corridor and social conservatives with an executive order mandating vaccine for school girls. Still, he defeated Senior Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison for the Republican nomination, after attacking her as a Washington insider and big spender. The Democratic nominee was former Houston Mayor Bill White.  

Utah
Lieutenant Governor Gary Herbert, Republican, inherited the governorship after Governor Jon Huntsman, Jr. resigned to serve as U.S Ambassador to China. In a state that has not elected a Democrat Governor since 1980, Herbert was elected to a full term.

2007 Iranian Seizure of Royal Navy Personnel,https://www.conservapedia.com/2007_Iranian_Seizure_of_Royal_Navy_Personnel,"On 23 March 2007, fifteen British Royal Navy personnel were illegally detained by the military forces of Iran.[1]

3 International Backlash
4 Release
5 Notes


Incident
On March 23, fifteen Royal Navy personnel from HMS Cornwall were conducting routine patrols of Iraqi waters. Around 10:25AM (UTC+3), the British boarded a merchant vessel which was suspected of smuggling contraband into Iraq. The vessel was soon surrounded by forces of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards, and taken captive.[2]

Iranian Claims
Soon after capturing the British personnel, Iran released a set of coordinates allegedly showing the position of the British soldiers when they were captured.[3] However, Iran quickly withdrew these coordinates after the UK pointed out that they were indeed still within Iraqi waters. Iran then released a second set of coordinates, likely falsified, that allegedly showed the British personnel in Iranian waters. Iran has also stooped to the level of using the captured personnel for propaganda purposes.[4]

International Backlash
The irrational actions of Iran have been appropriately criticized by many international governments. Australia,[5] Canada,[6] The European Union,[7] Sweden,[8] The United Nations,[9] and the United States[10] have all urged the immediate and unconditional release of the hostages. Iran has responded to the claims by threatening to try the soldiers for espionage, which is punishable by death in Iran.

Release
The Iranian Government released the 15 British military personnel on 5 April 2007.  The sailors and marines flew out of Tehran the same day.  Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said they are only being released as a ""gift"" to the British.[11]

"
2010 Deepwater rig explosion,https://www.conservapedia.com/2010_Deepwater_rig_explosion," President Obama directed the United States Coast Guard to dump toxic disperants into the Gulf of Mexico despite known health hazards to humans and wildlife. [3]The Gulf of Mexico oil spill began on 20 April 2010 when the Deepwater Horizon offshore oil drilling rig operated by BP (known as British Petroleum until 2000) exploded and sank.[1] Oil began leaking at a rate eventually estimated at 2.5 million gallons per day, resulting in massive environmental degradation.[2] The federal government reported that 206 million gallons of crude oil leaked before the spill was stopped on July 15.[3] The blowout killed eleven workers. Despite the known toxicity of the dispersant Corexit, the Obama administration dumped millions of gallons of the hazardous chemical into the Gulf of Mexico with C-130 aircraft provided by the U.S. Coast Guard[4] and the Air Force.[5]
On 31 March 2010 President Obama announced a plan for exploitation of offshore oil reserves during a speech at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington, D.C.[6] The President's actions have been labeled, ""a decision to endanger our coastal ecosystems with the risk of catastrophic oil spills.""[7] Defending the decision, the President remarked,



 “

 oil rigs today generally don’t cause spills. They are technologically very advanced.""[8][9]

 ”


Since taking office the Obama administration approved 346 oil drilling plans without securing permits required by law from the federal agency that assesses environmental impacts.[10] President Barack Obama has been widely criticized for an unprepared and bungled response, most notably from former supporters.

As of 15 July  2010 BP announced that the gushing well had been successfully capped. As of 4 August the government reported that only 26% of the originally leaked oil could be located in the Gulf.[11]

The Obama plan
 Map of expanded areas of offshore oil drilling authorized by President Obama on 31 March 2010.[12]Source: United States Department of Interior.
Obama called for expanded development and production throughout the Gulf of Mexico. The Department of Interior's Minerals Management Service (MMS) estimates that the Gulf of Mexico contains 36-41.5 billion barrels of  oil and 161-207 trillion cubic feet of natural gas resources. According a DOI press release, Obama's plan would ""expand oil and gas development and exploration"" while ""protecting fisheries, tourism, and places off U.S. coasts that are not appropriate for development.""[13]
The Associated Press has reported on the role ex-government regulators play in lobbying and influence; the chief of staff of the MSS's Gulf of Mexico region once stated that deep water drilling had ""few or no regulations or standards.""[14] Two years later the senior official left his job in the MMS to work for BP.[15] During President Obama's first year in office, as BP's regulatory compliance and environmental manager, the ex-MMS official lobbied the U.S. Ocean Policy Task Force to ""carefully weigh policies that may establish exclusionary zones"" or ""disrupt the MMS leasing program,"" according to a statement posted at whitehouse.gov.[16] He further stated that BP wanted access to off-limit areas such as the eastern Gulf of Mexico[17] which President Obama approved in March 2010.
Total U.S. offshore crude oil production in 2009 was 1.7 million barrels a day, of which 1.6 million barrels a day came from the U.S. section of the Gulf of Mexico.[18]
According to the New York Times, President Obama ""said several times during his presidential campaign that he supported expanded offshore drilling. He noted in his State of the Union address[19] in January [2010] that weaning the country from imported oil would require “tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development.”[20][21]
When questioned about the Obama regulators ""cozy relationship"" with oil companies the president responded, ""absolutely I take responsibility for that.""[22]

Obama administration asks Court to allow BP drilling in the Gulf of Mexico
Less than four months after President Barack Obama took office a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. found that the U.S. Government was unprepared for a major spill at sea, relying on an ""irrational"" environmental analysis of the risks of offshore drilling. The Obama administration urged the court to revisit the decision. In its arguments to the court, the Obama administration said that the loss of royalties on the oil, estimated at almost $10 billion, ""may have significant financial consequences for the federal government."" 
Among the existing leases was the Lease Sale #206. That deal included BP's acquisition, for $34 million, of the acreage encompassing the Deep Water Horizons well.
A day after the administration's petition, the industry's main lobbying group, the American Petroleum Institute, made its own case echoing the government's arguments. ""The significance of [Gulf of Mexico] activities under the five-year program cannot be overstated,"" the API argued.
Secretary Ken Salazar expressed confidence that problems within the Minerals Management Service that led to poor oversight of offshore drilling were resolved. In September 2009, in testimony before the House Natural Resources Committee, Salazar listed steps he had taken to make sure problems ""don't occur in the future.""
In Senate hearings held in mid-November 2009, Obama MMS Deputy Director Walter Cruickshank assured the Committee panel fears of containing a catastrophic blowout were misplaced, saying the U.S. had ""what we believe is the most aggressive oil spill contingency planning...in the world.""[23]

Approval of BP's response plan
The Obama administration accepted and approved BP's regional oil spill response plan for the Gulf of Mexico dated 30 June 2009[24] and covered all the company’s operations in the Gulf. The plan lists 

“Sea Lions, Seals, Sea Otters [and] Walruses” as “Sensitive Biological Resources” in the Gulf, suggesting that portions were cribbed from previous Arctic exploratory planning;
 Gives a web site for a Japanese home shopping site as the link to one of its “primary equipment providers for BP in the Gulf of Mexico Region [for] rapid deployment of spill response resources on a 24 hour, 7 days a week basis;” and
 Directs its media spokespeople to never make “promises that property, ecology, or anything else will be restored to normal.”[25]
The government approved plan made no mention about tracking sub-surface oil plumes from deepwater blowouts or preventing disease (viruses, bacteria, etc.) transmission to captured animals in rehabilitation facilities.

British Petroleum
During the first 100 days of the Obama administration, the Minerals Management Service (MMS) of the Department of the Interior granted a “categorical exclusion” from a detailed environmental impact statement required under law[26] to BP's Deepwater Horizon drilling operation, according to the Washington Post.[27] BP's exploration plan received in the Administration's MMS field office on 23 March 2009 states ""no mitigation measures other than those required by regulation and BP policy will be employed to avoid, diminish or eliminate potential impacts on environmental resources."" It declared any spill would have only ""sub-lethal"" effects on fish and marine mammals but it was ""unlikely that an accidental oil spill would occur from the proposed activities.""[28]
As Senator, and while running for president, Barack Obama received a total of $77,051 from BP[29] and has taken more money from BP's Political Action Committee and individuals connected with BP over the past 20 years than any other candidate, according to FEC disclosure records.[30] Likewise, the independent watchdog Center for Responsive Politics noted, ""the “top recipient of BP-related donations during the 2008 cycle was President Barack Obama himself.”[31][32]

 Obama approved drilling permits for BP without the statutory requirement to file an environmental impact assessment,[33] the handling of spills in a worst-case scenario,[34] and fostered a cozy relationship between government and the oil industry.[35] No other candidate took more money from BP in the past two decades than Obama received in only six years.[36]
Talk show personality Ed Schultz of MSNBC reiterated a call for campaign finance reform as a result of Barack Obama's ties to BP and the government's response.[37]
Transocean, owner of the Deepwater Horizons drilling rig leased to BP, was the recipient of the Obama Mineral Management Service's, Safety Award for Excellence.[38][39] On 30 April 2010 Transocean's stock fell after President Obama’s chief strategist, David Axelrod, made comments nine days into the disaster and the government raised estimates to more than fives times of what had previously been reported about how much oil was leaking into the Gulf of Mexico.[40]
It has been reported in the financial press that among owners of BP[41] are 

New Jersey Division of Investment (51 million shares)
California Public Employees Retirement System (36 million shares)
Pennsylvania Public School Employees Retirement System (7.1 million shares)
Teachers Retirement System of Alabama (4.5 million shares)
Employees Retirement System of Texas (4.1 million shares)
Ohio Public Employees Retirement System (1.1 million shares)
Illinois State Board of Investment (1.1 million shares)[42]
Indiana Public Employees' Retirement Fund (0.7 million shares)
Washington State Investment Board (1.2 million shares)
United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (21.9 million shares). 
BP was found wilfully negligent during the Bush administration in a Texas refinery explosion incident, and was assessed $108 million in fines - the highest workplace safety fines in U.S. history.[43]

Nalco and Corexit
 Dermatitis is one immediate health concern[44] of the Obama administration's decision to use toxic substances to disperse the visibility of the spill.  [4] Residents, cleanup workers, and tourists alike may be affected. [5]
Nalco of Naperville, Illinois formed a joint venture with Exxon Chemical in 1994 and the company's current leadership includes several executives from BP. Nalco reported it sold in excess of $40 million to BP of its dispersant, Corexit, shortly after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster.
Of 18 dispersants approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 12 were found to be more effective on southern Louisiana crude than Corexit, EPA data show.[45] Two of the 12 were found to be 100 percent effective on Gulf of Mexico crude, whereas two Corexit products rated only 56 percent and 63 percent effective.[46] The toxicity of the other 12 was shown to be in some cases 10 or 20 times less than Corexit, according to the EPA.[47] ""It's a chemical that the oil industry makes to sell to itself, basically,"" said Richard Charter, a senior policy adviser for Defenders of Wildlife.[48]
Corexit was found to be one of the most toxic dispersal agents ever developed.[49] With seasonal warming of water temperature the toxicity grows.  Corexit is banned in the United Kingdom due to environmental concerns.[50] The Obama EPA gave BP the green light to apply Corexit to the spill.[51]  At the Congressional hearing investigating the Gulf oil spill disaster, Democratic Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York raised the prospect of ""thousands and thousands of people getting sick or dying"" as a result of the administration's sanctioned use of the dispersant.[52] Critics allege use of dispersants like Corexit are largely for cosmetic purposes. Nalco has been a frequent contributor to the campaign of Sen. Mary Landrieu[53] of Louisiana.[54]

Deepwater Horizon
 Fire boat response crews battle the blazing remnants of the off shore oil rig Deepwater Horizon, April 21, 2010 (U.S. Coast Guard)
On Earth Day 2010, a BP-leased oil drilling rig sank to the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico two days after it exploded, creating what has been described as the ""worst environmental disaster in US history.""[55] Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar told CNN ""It potentially is catastrophic,"" and ""I think we have to prepare for the worst.""[56][57]
Congressional investigators think they have identified the rigs blowout preventer as the cause of the explosion.[58] The blowout preventer was leaking hydraulic fluid, had a dead battery,[59] and was inspected by the Obama Minerals Management Service (MMS) only two weeks before to the explosion[60] which killed 11 people. Amy Goodman, a leftist radio talk show host, has suggested those responsible should be prosecuted for manslaughter.[61]
Blowout preventers are meant to shut off the well, and the last line of defense is a set of shear rams which cut the pipe and seal off the well.[62] The MMS, the Obama administration agency that regulates offshore drilling along with the Coast Guard, is supposed to require  proof that shear rams are powerful enough to shut the well. Michael Saucier, MMS's regional supervisor testified before Congress that the MMS did not require BP to file a ""scenario for potential blowout.""[63] The MMS certified that BP ""has the capacity to respond, to the maximum extent practicable, to a worst-case discharge, or a substantial threat of such a discharge.""[64]
A May 2010 Inspector General's report revealed at least two MMS regulatory inspectors admitted to being under the influence of the illegal drug methamphetamine while on the job.[65][66]

Environmental disaster
 Projections of the flow of the spill over the summer of 2010. [6]
On 29 April 2010 oil began washing ashore in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana; four weeks later local leaders still were begging President Obama for federal assistance in responding to the disaster which was overtaking hundreds of miles of shoreline.[67]
Crude oil has washed into marshes, estuaries and onto beaches in Mississippi and Alabama. Wildlife has been killed and efforts are underway to save oil-coated
birds. Without capping the well Florida's Everglades may be turned into a ""dead zone."" Scientists expect currents to carry the oil slick to the eastern seaboard of the United States, fouling beaches and estuaries like the Chesapeake Bay and fishing grounds of the Grand Banks off Newfoundland.

Silverfish
Most scientists agree that Corexit 9500 will have a much larger biological effect when it reaches coastal areas teeming with wildlife.[68]  Many species are being threatened at a crucial time in their life cycle.[69] In testing done by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency the dispersant Corexit 9500 was found to be extremely lethal to silverfish, a benchmark organism in toxicity testing.[70]

Gulf menhaden
Gulf menhaden are a species harvested mostly for fish meal and fish oil. Menhaden could be badly affected
by the spill.

Coral, oyster and shrimp
Corals, oyster and shrimp likewise are critically affected. Richard Charter, a foremost expert on marine biology and oil spills who is a senior policy advisor for Marine Programmes for Defenders of Wildlife and is chairman of the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary Advisory Council has said, “There is a chemical toxicity to the dispersant compound that in many ways is worse than oil,” which ""in so doing you may be more seriously damaging the ecosystem offshore.”[71] Shrimp were found to be extremely vulnerable to the lethal effects of the chemical dispersant Corexit 9500 used by Obama administration disaster relief agencies and BP in testing done by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).[72]

Brown pelican
 Dead birds and sea turtles.
The Louisiana state bird, the Brown Pelican, was removed from protection under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 2009. The Obama administration approved BP's Deepwater Horizon drilling rig without the proper environmental impact assessment (EIA) required by law. The disaster occurred just as breeding season commenced.

Other bird species
Other species endangered by the oil spill are American oystercatcher and Wilson's plover.

Sea turtles
As several species of sea turtles move through the Gulf during their spring nesting season, they need to surface to breathe.

Toxic oil spill rain
A report prepared by the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources warned that the leaking crude oil into  the Gulf of Mexico is about to become the worst environmental catastrophe in all of human history, threatening the entire eastern half of North America with “total destruction.” Russian scientists based the assessment on the use of millions of gallons of the government approved chemical dispersant Corexit. 
The Russian scientists outlined that Corexit, with its 2.61ppm toxicity level,  combined with the seasonal warming of Gulf of Mexico waters, the molecules will be able to “phase transition” from their present liquid to a gaseous state allowing them to be absorbed into clouds and released as “toxic rain” upon all of Eastern North America.
The scientists warned should a Hurricane Katrina like storm form in the Gulf while tens of millions of gallons of Corexit are floating on or near the surface, the resulting “toxic rain” falling upon the North American continent could “theoretically” destroy all microbial life to any depth it reaches resulting in an “unimaginable environmental catastrophe” destroying all kinds of life forms.[73]

The response
Initially Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Coast Guard reported on 23 April 2010 there was no leak from the sunken oil rig.[74] The next day the Obama administration officially estimated a leak from the sunken well at 1000 barrels per day.[75] The Associated Press reported it took nine days after the explosion and the tragic loss of 11 workers lives before Obama made public commenta and acknowledged the disaster[76] and appointed a national incident commander.[77]
BP's stock fell[78] on news of the ""the worsening oil spill. "" Administration estimates were raised to 5000 barrels per day.[79]

U.S. Government dumps toxic dispersants into the Gulf of Mexico
 After President Obama's approval of the Deepwater Horizon's drilling rig permit and regulatory failures costing 11 workers their lives, the flow of oil into the Gulf of Mexico continued unabated for 86 days.
Wired Science reports the Obama administration disaster-relief agencies are using a toxic chemical to disperse oil in the Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster. Use of dispersants are said to be a public relations strategy.[80] Secretary Janet Napolitano of the Department of Homeland Security acknowledged[81] the U.S government was dumping toxic chemicals from C-130 cargo aircraft onto the spill.[82] Jackie Savitz of the ocean-conservation group Oceana stated the use of dispersants is only slightly less horrendous than the Gulf oil spill itself. ""You're basically pouring chemicals into the ocean, which is never a good thing.""[83] According to a 2009 Environmental Protection Agency report dispersants have not been used in the United State prior to the Obama administration's approval at BP'S request ""because of possible long-term environmental effects, difficulties with timely and effective application, disagreement among scientists and research data about their environmental effects, effectiveness, and toxicity concerns"" and the effects ""are still unknown.""[84] Residents in areas close to the oil spill have reported odors and symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, nausea, eye irritation, and respiratory problems.[85]

Disregard for worker safety
 Cleanup workers exposed to the Obama adminsitration's decision to use known toxic substances to disperse the spill. Critics allege dispersants are ineffective and largely for cosmetic purposes.
The Guardian (uk) has reported the controversy over Corexit exposes the Obama administration to criticism that its scientific agencies have been too accommodating to BP's strategy. In addition to the use of Corexit, the Obama Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) came under fire for withholding test results on the toxicity of the water close to shore.[86]
The dispersant 2-BE is known to cause heath dangers to clean up workers[87] and wildlife alike.[88] 2-BE has been documented to cause the breakdown of red blood cells, leading to blood in  urine and feces, and can damage the kidneys, liver, spleen and bone marrow of humans – effects not included on the information sheet for workers.[89] The dispersant Corexit 9500 is associated with headaches, vomiting and reproductive problems as sides effects to clean-up workers.[90] Lawrence Duffy of the University of Alaska claims dispersants ""are more a public relations measure than a preventive one. It has an effect on our psychology because we don't see the oil slick,""[91] though oil particles continue to do damage.[92]

Government mismanagement of relief efforts
Three weeks into the disaster National Public Radio reported the Obama administration's official figures were still grossly underestimated[93] and after the first month it was finally admitted the spill was nearly three times larger than earlier thought.[94]
Federal officials did not begin burning the leaking oil off the surface of the water until one full week after the rig collapsed.[95] Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal criticized President Obama for his slow response.[96] The New York Times castigated the White House for delays and not moving quick enough, calling the evidence ""damning"" and declaring the Gulf oil spill a ""huge disaster whose consequences might have been minimized with swifter action"" from the Obama administration.[97] One month into the spill, Democratic stalwarts James Carville,[98] Chris Matthews,[99] and Donna Brazile[100] criticized the inept and bungled response to the spreading catastrophe.

 Chris Oynes (left) of the Mineral Management Service presents Keelan Adamson (right) of Transocean the MMS's, Safety Award for Excellence (SAFE),[101] at the MMS National Award luncheon, 7 May 2009.[102]Source: Beacon magazine
The White House lacked any type of plan to combat the disaster. House Democratic Majority Leader Steny Hoyer publicly admitted that the Obama Administration was ill-prepared to deal with the situation.[103]  While the disaster steadily grew, Obama did not discuss the crisis at length until he appeared at a photo op at Venice, Louisiana on 3 May 2010.[104]   He would order a moratorium on all future deep sea oil platforms until they determine the problems associated with the current situation. As to be expected, Obama tries to remove himself from blame saying ""the system failed"", this despite the fact the he heads the system. Then he pointed fingers of blame at oil companies while taking an indirect jab at the Bush administration.[105]



 “

 For too long, for a decade or more, there has been a cozy relationship between the oil companies and the federal agency that permits them to drill. It seems as if permits were too often issued based on little more than assurances of safety from the oil companies. That cannot and will not happen anymore.

 ”


White House spokesman Robert Gibbs did his best to put a good spin on the disaster claiming the response was ""comprehensive and fast.""  Meanwhile, the Democrat-led Congress ordered public hearings from oil executives. President Obama blamed others saying the answers from oil executives were a ""ridiculous spectacle,"" ""You had executives of BP and Transocean and Halliburton falling over each other to point the finger of blame at somebody else."" [106] As the disaster progressed and questions arose over the government's misreporting and withholding[107] of information from the public about the true dimensions of the calamity, the Associated Press noted, 



 “

 First [Obama] was going to make BP pay for the Gulf oil mess. Then he declared himself in charge. Now he's trying to find out 'whose ass to kick' and making clear he'd fire BP's chief if only he could.[108]

Revitalizing cap and trade energy tax
Main article: Cap and trade
President Obama has been roundly criticized by Democrats and Republicans alike for attempting to use the national tragedy to revitalized his failed Cap and Trade energy proposals. The Obama proposal, widely perceived as a job-killer tax increase, has stalled in the U.S. Senate. California Senator Dianne Feinstein has stated the climate bill ""isn't going to stop the oil leak.""[109]
Environmentalists want the President to push the program. Fred Krupp of the Environmental Defense Fund calls the opportunity ""a political moment"" to pass a carbon tax estimated to cost the average U.S. household $4300 per year.[110]
Joel Benenson, who conducted polling for Obama’s presidential campaign, thinks the tax increase could pass, but wary Senate Democrats say otherwise. “There’s not a great call for it"" said West Virginia Democratic Senator Jay Rockefeller. “It’s unrelated” to the immediate crisis in the Gulf noted Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat from Nebraska.[111]


Assistance of foreign governments
Nearly two-months after the disaster took place, the Obama administration decides to utilize the assistance offered by 17 countries, the U.N and the European Union.[112] International aid offers already accepted include two skimmers and 2.6 miles (4.2 kilometers) of boom from Mexico, three sets of sweeping arm systems from the Netherlands and 1.86 miles (3.0 kilometers) of boom from Canada, the State Department said. The State Department noted that it has assisted BP in directly sourcing equipment and technical experts from around the world, including from Algeria, Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Latvia, Norway, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom.[113]

Public relations offensive
Faced with declining poll numbers and a public relations calamity, President Obama took to the airwaves nearly 60 days into the spill. A New York Times Op-ed commented,



 “

 All we got from President Obama was a vague call for some sort of new energy policy. Plus a Gulf Coast Restoration Plan, an oil spill study commission, a reminder that the secretary of energy won a Nobel Prize in physics and 17 references to God, prayer, blessings or faith.[114][115]

 ”


Former speechwriter for President Jimmy Carter, Chris Matthews, chided the President after his address to the nation,



 “

 Ludicrous that he keeps saying [Secretary of Energy] Chu has a Nobel prize. I'll barf if he does it one more time.[116]

 ”


Misrepresentation of evidence
Drilling moratorium based on junk science
The Washington Post reported in November 2010 the oil spill that damaged the Gulf of Mexico's reefs and wetlands also threatens to stain the Obama administration's reputation for relying on science to guide policy. The Department of Interior's concluded that the White House edited a drilling safety report in a way that made it falsely appear that scientists and experts backed the administration's six-month moratorium on new deep-water drilling. The editing changes by the White House resulted ""in the implication that the moratorium recommendation had been peer reviewed."" But it hadn't been. Outside scientists were asked only to review new safety measures for offshore drilling.[117]
In October 2010 the Presidential Oil Spill Commission said that the White House Office of Management and Budget delayed publication of a scientific report that forecast how much oil could reach the gulf's shores. The report said that President Obama's energy adviser and Socialist International operative Carol Browner,[118] mischaracterized on national TV a government analysis about where the oil went, saying it showed most of the oil was ""gone."" It also said Browner and the head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Jane Lubchenco, contributed to the public's perception that the report was more exact than it was.
Academics, environmentalists and federal investigators have accused the administration since the April 2010 spill of downplaying scientific findings, misrepresenting data and misconstruing the opinions of experts it solicited.[119]

Economic impacts
 Oil slick map as of May 30, 2010.
The economic impact of the Gulf of Mexico oil drilling disaster will be large and devastating to several key industries, including fishing, tourism, and transportation.[120]
The top commercial species in terms of value are shrimp ($367 million), menhaden ($64 million), oysters ($59 million), and blue crab ($38 million).[121] As of 25 May 2010, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) closed 54,096 square miles to commercial and recreational fishing.[122] These areas are some of the richest fishing grounds in the Gulf of Mexico for major commercial species such as white shrimp, blue crab, and oysters.

Employment in fishing
The most immediate economic impact of the oil spill has been on the Gulf fishing[123] industry. The number of jobs at stake, which includes seafood processing and related wholesale and retail, is over 200,000 with related economic activity of $5.5 billion.[124]
Dockside sales in Louisiana are approximately $660 million.[125] Loses to the Louisiana fishing could  be as high as $2.5 billion.[126]

Employment in tourism
The tourist industry employs 620,000 people who earn over $9 billion in wages in the Gulf of Mexico region. Analysts say Florida alone could lose $3 billion in tourism.[127]
In 2008, recreational anglers took 25.4 million fishing trips and spent over $12 billion on equipment and trips in the Gulf region.[128] Some of the most popular recreational species include snappers, several types of drum, sheepshead, and Spanish mackerel. Recreational fisheries support businesses such as charters, bait and tackle, and services such as restaurants and hotels. 
In 2000, 21.9 million people visited Gulf beaches and accounted for 177.2 million beach days.[129]

Transportation
The Offshore Marine Service Association (OMSA),[130] the national trade association for U.S. flag vessels in the energy sector, criticized the Obama administration's moratorium on offshore drilling projects. 100,000 jobs were immediately affected by the president's decision as companies began cancelling contracts to carry supplies, forcing layoffs. ""The industry has struggled to climb out of a severe economic downturn. The moratorium threatens any hope of recovery and creates the potential for economic hardship that could last a decade or longer,"" remarked OMSA President Ken Wells.
OMSA estimates that for every mariner who works on board a vessel, there are nine other Americans working in shore-side jobs that support vessel operations. Beyond the vessel crew, the negative consequences of the moratorium could impact everyone from service technicians supporting everything from diesel engines to the air condition systems to the local grocer who supplies food for the boat's galley.
Offshore vessels are a major part of the tax base in many coastal communities. Gulf Coast state and local government revenues will also decrease due to lower income tax and sales tax collections.
Disruption of shipping traffic in and out of the Port of New Orleans will impact barge, container, and tanker traffic in the Mississippi Delta and along the Mississippi River.  Prices of all types of commodities would affected.

Insurance industry
BP, the operator on the oil drilling lease with a 65% stake, insured itself, rather than buying coverage from insurance companies. Industry analysts estimate total costs related to the oil spill cleanup and damages could exceed $14 billion.[131]

Lost revenue to state and local governments
Louisiana
A Greater New Orleans study indicates the Obama administration's moratorium could cost Louisiana as many as 22,000 jobs and more than $782 million in revenues.
With the average deepwater rig employing 230 workers with an average salary of $98,000, the study puts the tax revenue impact at $151 million if drilling were to resume within 18 months. Greater New Orleans President and CEO Michael Hecht says it’s difficult to be optimistic based on President Obama’s Oval Office address on 15 June 2010. President Obama's action “has the potential to turn an ecological tragedy into an economic calamity,” Hecht said.[132] The study foresees in a worse case scenario the loss of more than 22,000 jobs, 3,450 of them directly tied to the operating rigs and 18,945 with indirect ties such as catering firms and other companies that serve U.S energy producers.
Fearing that the drilling moratorium ""could exacerbate, rather than alleviate, the impacts of this spill upon both our economy and our environment,"" U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu wrote to President Obama on 11 June 2010.[133] Landrieu stated, 



 “

 more than 300,000 Louisianians are employed either directly or indirectly by the oil and gas industry. ..The immediate impacts to the economy are devastating enough: idling the 33 rigs currently permitted to drill in the deepwater Gulf would immediately impact employment for roughly 38,000 crewmen, deck hands, engineers, welders, ROV operators, caterers, helicopter pilots, and others who operate and service these vessels. That's like closing 12 large motor vehicle assembly plants in one state, all at once.

 ”


Lost state and local tax revenues will accrue at a rate between $8 million and $15 million a month. Federal royalty losses will be substantial and a significant drop in tolls collected for the Louisiana Highway 1 bridge at Leeville, the main artery to the Port Fourchon energy port is projected as well.

Texas
The Texas state comptroller’s office reported collection of $2.3 billion in oil and natural gas production taxes in fiscal year 2009 and $4.1 billion in 2008. The tax revenue is used to repair roads and fund schools, among other state services. Although no official analysis of President Obama's decision to place a moratorium on offshore production has been compiled yet, the Texas comptroller’s office said it’s unclear how much of an impact the president's decision will have on state services. Experts warn the president's decision could threaten tens of thousands of jobs in the Houston area.[134]

Alabama
Manufacturing jobs in Alabama are at risk as a result of President Obama's actions, as no new orders for equipment are coming in.[135]

Increased dependency on foreign oil
New Jersey Democrat Senator Robert Menendez proposed a ban on new offshore drilling permits and submitted a bill that would retroactively raise the financial liability of BP from $75 million to $10 billion.[136] Oklahoma Republican Senator James Inhofe successfully killed the bill saying it would reduce competition and shut down smaller independent oil companies in favor of larger companies.

Too big to fail
An oil industry trade publication[137] reports President Obama and senior White House staff, as well as Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, are working with BP on legislation that would raise the cap on liability for damage claims from those affected by the oil disaster from $75 million to $10 billion. However the disaster has the real potential of costing nearly $1 trillion. Critics point out that in the deal between Obama and BP, $10 billion is a drop in the bucket for a trillion dollar disaster. Talk is noted in government circles, including FEMA, of the need to nationalize BP in order to compensate those who will ultimately be affected by the worst oil disaster in the history of the world, and BP would, if its assets were nationalized, be credited with almost a trillion dollars for compensation purposes.[138][139]
After Obama charged Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate the disaster, BP establish a $20 billion extrajudicial fund managed by an Obama appointee.[140] Former CNN news writer and radio talk show host Mike Malloy suggested Holder is beholden to corporatist interests.[141]

Criticism of the Obama administration's handling of the disaster
 Memorial service for the 11 workers killed in the explosion.Reuters [8]
Former top adviser to President Bill Clinton, James Carville, turned visibly emotional in an interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC's Good Morning America over President Barack Obama's ""lackadaisical"" response to the Gulf oil spill disaster. 



 “

 The political stupidity is unbelievable. ... The President of the United States  could have come down here. He could have been involved with the families of these 11 people...... He could have implemented a plan in anticipation of this... He could be commandeering tankers and making BP bring tankers in and clean this up.... He could be deploying people to the coast. He could be with the corps of engineers and the Coast Guard with these people in Plaquemines Parish, doing something about these regulations. These people are crying. They're begging for something down here. And it just looks like he's not involved in this! Man, you have got to get down here and take control of this! Put somebody in charge of this and get this thing moving! We're about to die down here![142][143][144]

 ”


Carville also said in a separate interview on CNN with Anderson Cooper,



 “

 They are risking everything by this ‘go along with BP’ strategy they have. They seem, like, lackadaisical on this...they seem like they’re inconvenienced by this, this is some giant thing getting in their way and somehow or another, if you let BP handle it, it’ll all go away. It’s not going away. It’s growing out there. It is a disaster of the first magnitude...the government thinks that they are partnering with BP. I think they actually believe that BP has some kind of a good motivation here. That’s one of the, sort of, whole flaws is they're naïve.[145][146]

 ”


Obama acknowledged the criticism days later in a televised press conference:



 “

 Where I was wrong was in my belief that the oil companies had their act together when it came to worst-case scenarios.[147]

 ”


 Day 12 of the Disaster: Obama enjoys an evening of levity and banter with the Washington Press Corps at the White House Correspondent's Dinner.
MSNBC talk show host Chris Matthews[148] said on Jay Leno's Tonight Show,



 “

 The president scares me. He's been acting a little like a Vatican Observer here. When is he actually going to do something? And I worry. I know he doesn't want to take ownership of it. I know politics. He said the minute he says, 'I'm in charge,' he takes the blame.[149]

 ”


Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential campaign manager in 2008 questioned if Democratic primary voters had 



 “

 underestimated the value of experience and crisis management as important attributes for their president.[150]

 ”


Donna Brazile, who managed the presidential campaign of Democratic candidate Al Gore in 2000 said on ABC's This Week,



 “

 One of the problems I have with the administration is that they're not tough enough. They are waiting for BP to say, ‘oh, we've got a new plan to stop the oil leak.’ They need to stop it, contain it, clean it up, and try to help us conserve our coastal wetlands.[151]

 ”


Dick Morris, an intimate adviser to President Bill Clinton observed,



 “

 these failings show that Obama is in over his head. But to the left, which bleeds for each drop of water in the gulf and cries over every turtle or shrimp or sea bird, it is an unpardonable sin...Obama's incompetence and inexperience is causing liberals to see him as arrogant, aloof, removed, conceited, suspicious of outside advice and even lazy...these character defects will haunt the president until 2012 and beyond.[152]

 ”


David Gergen worked in the Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Clinton White House remarked,



 “

 If our government had fought WWII like the way we’re fighting the oil spill, there’s a good chance many of us would be speaking German today.[153]

 ”


Republican Chairman Michael Steele criticized the president for golfing while the oil crisis worsened.[154]



 “

 Until this problem is fixed, no more golf outings.

 ”


Peggy Noonan, a speech writer for President's Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, summed up public perceptions with,



 “

 The president, in my view, continues to govern in a way that suggests he is chronically detached from the central and immediate concerns of his countrymen.... he has not, almost from the day he was inaugurated, been in sync with the center....The American people have spent at least two years worrying that high government spending would, in the end, undo the republic. They saw the dollars gushing night and day...And now we have a videotape metaphor for all the public’s fears: the well gushing black oil into the Gulf of Mexico ...His philosophy is that it is appropriate for the federal government to occupy a more burly, significant and powerful place in America—confronting its problems of need, injustice, inequality. ... Then the oil spill came and government could not do the job, could not meet the need ...Katrina illustrate[d] that even though the federal government in our time has continually taken on new missions and responsibilities, the more it took on, the less it seemed capable of performing even its most essential jobs. Conservatives got this point—they know it without being told—but liberals and progressives did not. They thought Katrina was the result only of George W. Bush’s incompetence and conservatives’ failure to “believe in government.” But Mr. Obama was supposed to be competent....It’s not good to have a president in this position—weakened, polarizing and lacking broad public support—less than halfway through his term. That it is his fault is no comfort.[155]

 ”


New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd wrote,



 “

 Obama and top aides who believe in his divinity make a mistake to dismiss complaints of his aloofness as Washington white noise. He treats the press as a nuisance rather than examining his own inability to encapsulate Americans’ feelings.[156]

 ”


Actor Robert Redford demanded action from the Obama administration. The liberal special interest group Natural Resources Defense Council has Redford in a new ad decrying the lackluster response.[157] Redford made an appearance on MSNBC and said there is no one manning this ship,



 “

Liberal Hollywood director James Cameron says;



 “

 Over the last few weeks I've watched, as we all have, with growing horror and heartache, watching what's happening in the Gulf and thinking those morons don't know what they're doing.[158]

Obnoxious Hollywood liberal Rosie O'Donnell said, ""We broke the womb of freaking mother Earth.""  [159] In addition, O'Donnell accused BP of

Foreign reaction
Relations between allies the U.K. and U.S. are now at historic lows thanks to Barack Obama's mishandling of the oil spill. Britain had been repeatedly mocked by Obama prior to the spill[161][162][163] but now find themselves subjected to endless propaganda. Prominent foreign dignitaries have expressed the public's growing frustration with the administration's posturing and hunt for scapegoats. The mayor of London, Boris Johnson, who supported Obama in 2008, decried ""anti-British rhetoric, buck-passing and name-calling"" while Lord Tebbit branded Mr Obama's conduct “despicable” and the president's rhetoric

12 tribes,https://www.conservapedia.com/12_tribes,"The Twelve tribes of Israel were the sons of Jacob (renamed Israel) and were the lineage of the Jewish people.  It was the cultural custom to not only identify as being Hebrews, but also which particular 'house' one came from.
This information of tribe lineage was lost sometime after the diaspora. But the book of Revelation implies that God remembers which ""house"" every Jew alive descends from, and will make 144,000 specific appointments from these tribes in the Last Days. (Revelation 7:1-7 )
The twelve tribes are commonly listed in this order:  Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, Dan, Gad, Naphtali, Asher, Joseph, and Benjamin.
Each tribe was given a section of the promised land for themselves and their descendants.  Levi, the priestly branch, was not given an inheritance, but was given grazing rights in the suburbs of forty-eight cities scattered throughout Israel.  Instead the land divisions were kept at twelve by dividing the lineage of Joseph by his two sons:  Ephraim and Manasseh. (In the days of the Kingdom of Judah, all the Levites defected from the rival Kingdom of Israel and have remained associated with Jewry to this day.)

Democratic National Convention
Summary
The 2008 Democratic National Convention was held in Denver, Colorado, from August 25 to August 27 at Pepsi Center. There, Senator Obama and his running mate were selected to be the party nominee's. Barack Obama will accepted the party's nomination in front of a crowd of more than 75,000 in a free, open event held at INVESCO Field at Mile High, in a platform resemblant to a Greek temple. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is the Permanent Chair of the Convention.
The convention had a rocky start as friction between supporters of Obama and the Clintons was not resolved.  Instead of Obama getting a bump in the polls, his support actually declined.  The Democrats also seemed to be at odds on finding a unifying strategy for how hard to attack John McCain and how to present it.  As Democratic pundit James Carville said in an interview on CNN, ""If this party has a message, it's done a <heck> of a job hiding it tonight, I promise you that.""[1]
A bleak convention was turned around by the Clintons. Infighting between Obama and Hillary continued through the day of her speech, but a comprise was reached, and, beyond expectations, she gave a rousing speech for Obama - possibly as an angry response to McCain's latest ad that showed her 'supporting' him. Bill Clinton the next night also praised Obama, something that he failed to effectively do in 2000 for Al Gore when he centered on his accomplishments and gave little more than lip service to Gore with statements amounting to 'and Al Gore was there too'. The convention, possibly remembering that, gave him the topic he was to speak on instead of choosing his own. Clinton was angered, but it worked. He came through. By the time Obama spoke on the last night, the theme that was missing at first was clear, and Obama mixed a message of attacking McCain with the need for change and even outlining some expensive programs that would appeal to the target populace who has been lukewarm to him. From a political point of view, the convention did what it was supposed to.

Scandal
Denver officials had constructed a secret jail to house those that would misbehave in the Mile High City when the Democrats attend their convention. The makeshift holding center, dubbed ""Gitmo on the Platte"" by activists, contained barbed wire fencing and signs warning of stun gun use. The Steele Street warehouse was designed to process 60 arrestees per hour.[2]
Ingrid Mattson, president of the Islamic Society of North America, spoke at a prayer service at the convention. Hidden from the public because nobody debated it at the time, the group has ties to funding Hamas terrorists and the facts were well known July 2008. Mattson's group says it does not condone terrorism.  The Holy Land Foundation and five of its former leaders were convicted of funneling millions of dollars to Hamas for which the ISNA funded and supported.[3]
Cnet reported that in the week of the convention, an unusual phenomenon occurred on Craigslist's Denver Web site. Ads soliciting casual sex spiked 80% that week, as tens of thousands of people had arrived for the Democratic convention. Those convention days showed the week-over-week jump in sex ads. Monday increased 77 percent over the average of earlier in the month; Tuesday increased 69 percent; Wednesday's increase was 74 percent. The online solicitations featured such lurid titles as ""Does the DNC make you hot?"" and content far worse than that.[4] No analogous phenomenon was reported during the Republican convention.

Protest

American Right to Life Action, an anti-abortion group, claims to have displayed the largest ever protest sign in history, 530 feet tall and 666 feet wide. The sign says ""Destroys uNborn Children"" [sic], with the words appearing one atop each other to also form the acronym ""DNC."" [5] According to a release from the group, ""thousands of DNC delegates and journalists can look out their hotel windows to the west to see the sign."" ""The tiniest boys and girls should be loved and protected, but as nominating Barack Obama emphasizes, the DNC even supports killing kids in the womb old enough to know their mother's voice, sleep and dream, suck their thumbs, and play with their toes."" The Guinness Book of World Records assigned American Right To Life an official world record attempt number: 228132.

Republican National Convention
Summary
The 2008 Republican National Convention was held in Saint Paul, Minnesota from September 1 (Labor Day) until September 4. The presumptive nominee was Senator McCain. The location has political significance in that Minnesota will likely be a close state during the general election, as will it's neighboring states Wisconsin and Iowa.
The convention schedule had to be altered due to the upcoming landfall of Hurricane Gustav. The first day almost entirely focused on raising money for Hurricane relief.  This led to a shortened three day convention instead of four and there was some shuffling of who was speaking on which day to accommodate the suddenly shortened time span.  In a surprise, George W. Bush was only delivered an eight minute speech by satellite.  In another surprise Sarah Palin's speech was watched by as many people as saw Obama give his acceptance speech on the closing night of the Democratic convention, as over 40 million people tuned in.[6]  She was considered the highlight of the convention, even surpassing John McCain's speech the next day, and was noted for doing an exceptional job.  Recognizing the strong asset that they have in her, the Republicans made reference to her many times on the last day of the convention.  McCain, not known for being comfortable reading prepared speeches in a convention hall, delivered a solid speech.  While Obama continued to enjoy a lead in the polls, it changed quickly thereafter to a slight McCain-Palin edge.  The Republican convention more than canceled out a very powerful Democratic convention.

Convention Schedule
Note:  Due to the hurricane and the effort to use their public forum to raise funds for it, the first night of the Republican convention was not shown.  Adjustments were made throughout to accommodate that loss.

William Philippi Black, known as Buckskin Bill, (September 8, 1929 – January 10, 2018), was a television personality and a school board member from Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
Black appeared daily from 1955 to 1988 on WAFB-TV (CBS) as the western character ""Buckskin Bill,"" who charmed children with his storytelling and good-natured presence. His two children's shows, Storyland aired in the morning, and ""The Buckskin Bill Show"" ran at 3:30 p.m. on weekdays. When the series ended in 1988, it held the national record for the longest-running children's show in the United States. After the weekday programs, the series ran for two more years as a Saturday morning program.[1]
In 1994, Black was elected to the East Baton Rouge Parish School Board with 82 percent of the ballots cast.[2] Black's victory came amid a school reform movement known as the Community Action for Public Education. Most of the sitting board members at the time were replaced. Black represented the Broadmoor area until he left the board in 2010.[1] 
Black attended Lyon College, a Presbyterian-affiliated liberal arts institution in Batesville, Arkansas, and Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.[3] While in college, he worked as a rodeo clown. He was a comic and emcee in the United States Army during the Korean War. In 1955, while working at a television station in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Black was contacted by a former boss at the new station,  WAFB, Channel 28. He accepted an offer of a position as an entertainer and advertising salesman. He was first a cameraman before becoming ""Buckskin Bill"", a Native American scout.[4]
Black worked successfully to establish a zoo in Baton Rouge. For fifteen years, Black signed off each broadcast with the refrain, ""Remember, Baton Rouge Needs a Zoo."" The zoo opened on Easter 1970. Children in Black's audience were enlisted in an “Elephant March"" and collected 650,000 pennies to purchase the zoo's first two elephants named “Penny” and “Penny Too.” Phil Frost, the director of the Baton Rouge Zoo, said the organization is “forever indebted and is truly grateful for Black’s work.""[1]
Black received accolades from the National Association of Broadcasters and Baton Rouge's highest civic honor, the Golden Deeds Award. In 1989, he received the annual ""Humanitarian Award"" from the Baton Rouge Council on Human Relations. Black and his wife, Elma K. Black (1929-2017), a drug abuse and parenting specialist, founded the “I Care Program,” which provides crisis counseling to children in East Baton Rouge Parish.[1]
Black died at the age of eighty-eight from an infection obtained through a partial hip replacement surgery. He was survived by a son and two daughters.[1] Services were held on January 19, 2018, at Broadmoor United Methodist Church in Baton Rouge. Burial was private.[5]
Baton Rouge Mayor-President Sharon Weston Broome, Black's fellow Democrat, offered her condolences to the family upon Black's passing: ""Not only did he delight generations of Baton Rouge children by giving them their first opportunity to appear on television, he did so while providing some of the first multimedia educational materials in the country and teaching the importance of charity and community. He was a man ahead of his time and lived his life demonstrating that it is the community’s central mission to take care of each other.""[1]

The simplest kind of document file is one which only contains raw text, with no support for custom fonts, styles, or images.  This kind of document is called a text file.  Other kinds of documents do offer various customization options allowing users to add things such as properties (bold, underline, strike-through, and italics), custom fonts, and colors to the text.  Some also include the option to add images to the file.

File formats
Documents are very common for a wide variety of uses.  There are many programs which read and create them, and many file formats as well.  Theses are some common formats of document files:

Office Document (.doc) - Perhaps the most common and compatible document format, though slightly dated
Office Document XML (.docx) - The new format Microsoft Word uses, which compresses the XLM data of the file
Microsoft Works Document (.wps) - A simpler version of the .doc format which does not include macros and some other advanced features,[1] also used by Kingsoft (WPS) Office
Open Document Format (.odf) - used by Open Office and its fork LibreOffice, which stores the XLM data of the file
AbiWord (.abw) - AbiWord file format which stores the XML[2]
AbiWord Gzip compressed XML (.zabw or .abw.gz) - Another AbiWord file format which stores the Gzip Compressed XML[2]
Rich Text (.rtf) - An older, highly compatible format which offers some options but not nearly as many as most others
Plain Text (.txt) - a plain text (ASCII, UTF-8) file which offers no styling
Portable Document Format (.pdf) - A portable, minimally editable format for redistribution of a complete work
Pages Document (.pages)
LaTeX Source Document (.tex and LTX) - A high-quality typesetting system which can include text, symbols, mathematical expressions, and graphics.[3]

16th Amendment to the United States Constitution,https://www.conservapedia.com/16th_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution," Ratification page for the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (1913)
The Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution allows the Congress to ""lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived"".
Far-reaching in its social as well as its economic impact, the income tax amendment became part of the Constitution by a curious series of events culminating in a bit of political maneuvering that went awry.

Background
Civil War
The financial requirements of the American Civil War prompted the first American income tax in 1861. At first, Congress placed a flat 3-percent tax on all incomes over $800 and later modified this principle to include a graduated tax. Congress repealed the income tax in 1872, but the concept did not disappear.

Post Civil War
After the Civil War, the growing industrial and financial markets of the eastern United States generally prospered. But the farmers of the south and west suffered from low prices for their farm products, while they were forced to pay high prices for manufactured goods. Throughout the 1860s, 1870s, and 1880s, farmers formed such political organizations as the Grange, the Greenback Party, the National Farmers’ Alliance, and the People’s (Populist) Party. All of these groups advocated many reforms (see the Interstate Commerce Act) considered radical for the times, including a graduated income tax. 

Progressive Era
In 1894, as part of the Wilson-Gorman tariff bill, Congress enacted a 2-percent tax on income over $4,000. The tax in 1895 was struck down by a five-to-four decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. It held unconstitutional any direct tax by Congress on income.  A tax on income derived from property was a direct tax which Congress could impose only by the rule of apportionment according to population pursuant to Article I, Secs. 2 and 9 of the Constitution.  The Pollock decision was a surprise because merely 15 years earlier the Supreme Court had unanimously upheld a similar tax during the Civil War, the only other time that Congress had tried to tax income directly.
Although radicals denounced the Court’s decision as a prime example of the alliance of government and business against the farmer, a general return of prosperity around the turn of the century softened the demand for reform. Democratic Party Platforms under the leadership of three-time Presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan, however, consistently included an income tax plank, and the progressive wing of the Republican Party also espoused the concept.
After Pollock, the Court did uphold creative taxation by Congress based on a theory that they were levied on mere ""incidents of ownership"" and thus were constitutional excise taxes:  (1) an inheritance tax, (2) a tax affixing revenue stamps to memoranda for the sale of merchandise on commodity exchanges, (3) a war revenue tax upon tobacco being resold, and (4) a corporate income tax as an excise ""measured by income"" justified by the privilege of doing business in corporate form.

Comeback
The income tax, long a dream of progressives, was put on the back burner until a later date and more opportune time to try again.  As a few years went by, the popularity of taxing income gradually increased once more, and even was included as a topic in the 1907 State of the Union address of then president Theodore Roosevelt.[1]

Passage
In 1909 progressives in Congress, led by Republican Senator Nelson Aldrich, Republican of Rhode Island, proposed a constitutional amendment allowing an income tax.  President William Howard Taft gave an important speech in support of the effort on June 16, 1909.[2]  Shortly thereafter, a resolution proposing the 16th amendment was submitted on July 12, 1909.[3] The amendment was ratified by one state legislature after another, and on February 25, 1913, with the certification by Secretary of State Philander C. Knox, the 16th amendment took effect. The first income tax was passed in 1913 as part of the Underwood Tariff. Since the new tariff was lower, the government needed a way to replace the lost revenue. Due to generous exemptions and deductions, less than 1 percent of the population paid income taxes at the rate of only 1 percent of net income. However, during World War I the heavy cost of the war led to much higher rates; the rates were lowered in the 1920s.
The Sixteenth Amendment settled the constitutional question of permission to tax income and, by so doing, effected dramatic changes in the American way of life.  The states which ratified the amendment are as follows:[4]

 Utah, March 9, 1911
The remaining states ratified this amendment, after the necessary number was reached:  Vermont, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and West Virginia.

Repeal efforts
On April 13, 2000, an organization called We the People Foundation for Constitutional Education, Inc. sent delegates to Washington D.C. to argue that the 16th Amendment was not properly ratified. There are a number of questionable circumstances surrounding the ratification, including evidence that states which were claimed to have ratified it actually rejected it.
